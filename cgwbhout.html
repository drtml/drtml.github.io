      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>It's almost Valentine's Day, and Kaito finds out that Shuichi has a crush on Kaede. Here is the story that ensues.<br/>Or, alternately titled, "kaito really wants shuichi to get a gf"</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>this is going to be a weird mix of japanese and english?? like, the characters are referred to with last names and honourifics and are also written with their last names in the story, but kaito still calls maki 'maki roll' instead of harumaki, and the names are all written first name last name (like kaede akamatsu instead of akamatsu kaede).<br/>also, kiibo is human in this au, i guess. he's only in there for one scene so far so that isn't super important.<br/>i hope you enjoy this trainwreck. i really like saimatsu gdi<br/>also i really like harvey's. do they have harvey's in america? bc that shit is GOOD</p><p>alt. title: saihara is anxious<br/>edit 1: catch me changing the date so that it fits better storytelling wise</p></blockquote>

  <b>February 9th - Five days until Valentine’s Day</b>
</p><p>“Shuichi. Shuichi. Heeeeeyyyyy, earth to Shuichi!”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, sorry…”</p><p>Kaito blinked, then looked down at the aforementioned Shuichi’s binder. His notes were messy, starting out with his normal neat writing and devolving into something akin to chicken scratch. The bottom of the page was filled with doodles of nothing in particular, swirls and designs. </p><p>“You good, dude? You’re not usually so unfocused,” Kaito whispered, sounding concerned. Shuichi fumbled with his pencil as the lecture droned on in the background, frantically erasing his drawings.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m fine, Kaito,” Shuichi mumbled, straightening his posture. He fixed his gaze straight ahead, starting at the professor.</p><p>“Okay, now I definitely know something’s off.” Kaito leaned in closer to Shuichi, pushing away his own notebook. “Kai-to. You haven’t called me ‘Kaito’ in years.”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. Sorry, Kaito,” Shuichi responded, starting to write again- in cursive, of course. He jutted his neck out, certainly straining something.</p><p>“Huh, well—” Kaito began, but was quickly cut off by a girl sitting in the row behind them.</p><p>“Hey! You two! Stop talking!” she whisper-shouted, tapping her pencil on the desk.</p><p>“Sorry, Tenko.” Kaito gave an apologetic wave to the long-haired girl. She screwed up her face and stuck out her tongue in jest, then returned to her notes. </p><p>Kaito then slid closer to Shuichi with a small, smug smile on his lips. “Soooo, what’s bothering my sidekick today?” </p><p>Shuichi narrowed his eyes as he peered down at the Kaito lying across his desk. “Just like I said- nothing,” he insisted, looking away.</p><p>“That’s not gonna work on me, Shuichi,” Kaito chuckled. “Tell your buddy Kaito everything. I’m your therapist today.”</p><p>Shuichi sighed as if almost admitting defeat. He pushed his binder forward slightly and rested his elbows on his desk. He took his pencil between the tips of his fingers and pointed it at the back of a blond girl sitting in the row in front of them. “Her.” </p><p>“Kaede?” Kaito looked up at Shuichi with wide eyes. “Ohhhh my Goooooddddd, does my Shuichi have a crush?”</p><p>“Sh-shut up! You’re being so loud!” Shuichi’s shoulders tensed and he glared down, refusing to look up. Kaito grinned widely, and clapped his hands together- quietly, as to not further anger Tenko.</p><p>“You like Kaede? Really?” Kaito asked inquisitively. It’s not like he really needed an answer- the way Shuichi’s normally pale face turned beet-red was enough of an indication. </p><p>“Stop saying her name!” Shuichi whispered furiously, sinking down into his chair. “She’s gonna hear you!”</p><p>And as if by pure coincidence, she did hear them. Not the intricacies of their conversation, but if people can hear someone calling her name out of thin air, someone can definitely hear two university boys gossiping about them.</p><p>Kaede turned slightly in her seat, looking up with a confused expression. Shuichi let out some sort of yelp and awkwardly raised his hand in greeting, his heart racing in his chest. Kaito waved cheerily at her.</p><p>She smiled at the two and gave them both her own little wave. Shuichi felt his heart skip two beats. <i>Holy hell, she acknowledged me.</i> He watched her for a while, after she had gone back to taking her notes, tracing her movements with his eyes.</p><p>Once Kaito made sure Kaede had stopped paying attention, he smirked at Shuichi. “Alright, alright, I see your game. She’s hot, and she’s nice. The whole package—”</p><p>“How many times do I have to tell you to <i>shhh!</i>” Tenko piped in from behind them, throttling her eraser. Kaito rolled his eyes playfully.</p><p>“Sorry, girl.” Tenko shot him a glare. <i>If looks could kill…</i> “We’ll stop bothering you, alright?”</p><p>“You better,” Tenko growled. Beside her, Himiko leaned forward and placed her hand on hers to steady her.</p><p>Kaito straightened and locked eyes with a blushing Shuichi. He stuck out two fingers, pointed them at himself, and then to Shuichi. “This conversation will continue after the lecture.”</p><p>-</p><p>As class ended, Shuichi started to stuff books into his knapsack. He watched Kaede out of the corner of his eye as she put away her own binders and began to leave with her posse of Maki and Miu.</p><p>“Instead of staring at her like a creep, why don’t you try talking to her?” Kaito suggested, carefully putting his belongings into his bag.</p><p>“Talk to her? What are you, insane? She’s totally out of my league, and also, I have anxiety,” Shuichi mumbled, </p><p>“She’s not that out of your league. She’s friends with Maki Roll, who is your slash my friend slash girlfriend, respectively, and therefore makes us apart of her league,” Kaito explained, shouldering his backpack. Shuichi snorted as he did the same.</p><p>“Let’s be real, Kaito, you’re probably out of my league, too,” he mumbled bitterly. </p><p>“Hey now,” Kaito said, a hard edge to his voice. “That’s not what I like to hear. Social leagues are BS anyways. We’re all just people, in this universe of ours,” he mused, gesturing with his hand while the two began to leave the lecture hall together.</p><p>They stepped out of the room and immediately heard a sharp outburst of laughter. Shuichi blinked, noticing Kaede and her friends talking to two other people- a tall, gangly green-haired guy and slightly shorter but still tall girl with blue hair.  <i>Rantaro and Tsumugi</i>, Shuichi thought. He was friends-ish with them… Or so he thought. Maybe they just thought of him as an acquaintance? <i>Have I been deceiving myself this whole time? </i></p><p>Rantaro was leaning against the wall and looking deeply into Kaede’s eyes as they spoke. Shuichi felt a sudden surge of jealousy burn deep in the pit of his stomach. <i>Why is she talking to him, and not me? Is it because he has better eyelashes than me? Is that it?</i></p><p>“Maybe I should buy some mascara,” he mumbled to himself.</p><p>“What?” Kaito asked.</p><p>“Nothing,” Shuichi quickly responded.</p><p>He gripped one of his backpack straps tightly as they came upon the group of people. An unnatural nervousness filled him, and he felt himself withdraw into himself self-consciously, eyes glued to the floor. <i>Dammit Shuichi, she’s a cute girl, not the prime minister!</i></p><p>Shuichi prepared himself to rush past Kaede as fast as humanly possible when Kaito committed the most devilish, most foul act he ever could have done- he stopped beside them. Sporting a confident smile and relaxed posture, he rested a hand on Maki’s shoulder and cheerfully said, “hey guys!”</p><p>“Kaito?!” Shuichi said in a panicked, hushed tone. Kaito winked at him.</p><p>“Hi, Kaito!” Tsumugi responded. Rantaro gave him a casual wave. “Hey,” he said with a charming smile. <i>Damn, he’s so suave, with a hint of mystery. I should ask him for lessons.</i></p><p>“What’s hanging, dickwad?” Miu greeted, ever so eloquently. “Hello, Kaito!” Kaede said brightly. </p><p>“Hi, Kaito,” Maki said softly. Kaito grinned at her and leaned in, giving her a small kiss on the cheek. She blushed noticeably and she flattened her mouth, as if trying not to smile. Shuichi glanced at her and noticed the corners of her lips twitching.</p><p>“Awww,” Kaede cooed. “You two are soooo sweet.”</p><p>“How’s my Maki Roll doing?” Kaito asked as Shuichi attempted unceremoniously to sneak glimpses at Kaede without seeming a) too obvious or b) too much of a creeper. He wasn’t even able to look at her face fully. It was like staring at the sun- impossible to look at directly.</p><p>“I’m doing well. Class was boring today, though.” Maki reached up and gently touched the hand on her shoulder. “Usually you like to head straight to the dorms after class, to ruminate in peace, I guess. Any particular reason you’re standing here right now?” she asked.</p><p>“Stop insulting my character,” Kaito replied jokingly, in mock offense. “Am I not allowed to stop and chat with my girlfriend?”</p><p>Maki blinked non-committally. Kaito sighed.</p><p>“Alright, alright. I do have an ulterior motive for stopping.” Shuichi’s blood ran cold underneath his skin. <i>Kaito I beg of you for all that is good and holy do not say anything about-</i> “Shuichi and I are going to Harvey’s tonight for dinner. Wanna come with?”</p><p>“We are?” Shuichi exhaled, letting out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.</p><p>“Hell yeah, burgers!” Kaito responded. Then he paused, and smiled. “Of course, any of you are also welcome to come,” he added, looking at the other people present, his gaze lingering on Kaede for a little longer than the others. Shuichi wished he had his hat with him so he could pull it over his eyes and hide his face from the world.</p><p>“That sounds fun!” Kaede piped up. “But Maki, Miu, and I are gonna watch a movie in my dorm tonight and eat garbage food. You know, girl stuff,” she chuckled. Shuichi smiled at her peppy words. <i>She’s so cute.</i> Kaito wrapped an arm around him and forced his head up, and he was faced with his worst fear- eye contact.</p><p>He looked around dumbly and focused on Rantaro as he started to speak. “Sounds like a great time, guys, but alas, I already agreed to be Tsumugi’s lab rat tonight.” He shrugged and Kaede tittered at his comment. Shuichi felt the blush rise to his cheeks. <i>Why is he so cool? I hate my life.</i></p><p>“Lab rat? I’m offended!” Tsumugi gasped. “I’m only having you help me fit and model some cosplays!” she explained to the rest of the group, waving her hands frantically. Rantaro rolled his eyes and placed his hand beside his mouth, as if telling us a secret.</p><p>“Lab rat,” he whispered.</p><p>“Sucks, sounds like no one can come to your lame circlejerk,” Miu interjected. Kaede gently slapped her arm.</p><p>“Miu, don’t be mean!” she said. “Anyways, I’m sorry we can’t go! Maybe next time?”</p><p>“Totally,” Kaito agreed. “I guess tonight will just be a bro night between bros, right, Shuichi?”</p><p>“Huh?” Shuichi snapped out of his thoughts. “Oh, um, yeah. Total bro time.” He gave an awkward thumbs up. <i>Why did I do that? I think God hates me.</i> Kaito flashed a smile and chuckled at his friend’s incompetence. </p><p>“Are you alright, Shuichi? You’re quieter than usual, which is saying something,” Maki asked in her typical deadpan voice, but Shuichi could hear the concern lying beneath it.</p><p>“Hm? Yeah, I’m fine.” Shuichi smiled weakly. Maki blinked, as if she knew he was lying. “Everything is going fine, in my life.”</p><p>Kaito cleared his throat. “Anyways, Shuichi and I should be going. You know, gotta finish the homework before our brouting. Like, bro-outing. I just came up with that. Man, I’m a genius.” Kaito commended himself and then looked thoughtful for a moment. “We’re gonna find some hotties on our brouting, aight, Shuichi?”</p><p>“What?” Shuichi’s eyebrows knit.</p><p>“I mean I’ve already been blessed with the most gorgeous girl ever,” Kaito said, slinging his free arm around Maki.  She reddened upon contact. “But we’ll find you a close second, Shuichi.”</p><p>“At a Harvey’s?” Shuichi asked.</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Obviously.” Kaito clicked his tongue and pulled away from Maki, starting off down the hall. “Wish us luck!”</p><p>“Good luck!” Tsumugi said.</p><p>“Bye, Kaito! Bye, Shuichi!” Kaede waved her hand, giving a little bounce and a cute smile. <i>She knows my name! I mean, Maki just said it but still, sHe KnOwS mY nAmE!</i> Shuichi felt a tad overwhelmed.</p><p>“B-Bye, Kaede,” he mumbled nervously, fiddling with his fingers. Kaito smiled at his dismay and led him away from the group, his arm still around the shy boy’s neck. As the chatter of the group faded into the distance as they walked further and further away, Shuichi turned to Kaito. “Why did you bring up, um, picking up chicks at a fast food place?”</p><p>“Uh, to let Kaede know that you’re both single and available, duh,” he responded.</p><p>“You could have done it in a less obvious manner,” Shuichi pointed out.</p><p>“Incorrect. That was totally lowkey.” Kaito pushed open a door and the two stepped out.</p><p>“Yeahhhh, alright. It’s not like she could tell, just because of who I am as a person,” Shuichi sighed, still feeling the hot flush on his face.</p><p>“Come now,” Kaito said. “You have the capabilities to be a lady killer, you just don’t use them.”</p><p>“Sure, sure.” Shuichi rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Whatever. Now, let’s go and do our homework.”</p><p>-</p><p>

</p><p>“If you could stop smiling at your phone like an idiot, we could go,” Shuichi said sarcastically, looking pointedly at Kaito. He stood up and and pocketed his phone, with a satisfied smile on his lips. He grabbed his jacket from the back of the chair he was sitting in and pulled it on.</p><p>“Shuichi, tell me what I did to deserve the coolest girlfriend alive?” he sighed, rattling the keys in his pocket.</p><p>“I don’t know, man. The real question is how did you keep her?” Shuichi muttered.</p><p>Kaito punched him gently in the arm. “Because I’m charismatic and charming, duh.” Shuichi chuckled and buttoned up his coat as he and his roommate headed out of their dorm. Kaito pushed open the door and Shuichi stepped outside. “Ready for some greasy food, bro?”</p><p>“Harvey’s is substantially less greasy than a lot of food we could be eating tonight,” Shuichi pointed out, shoving his hands into his pockets. Kaito made a non-specific, animal-like sound as he shoved his key in the doorknob and jostled the lock shut. </p><p>“I mean, I guess.” Video game music, the sounds of televisions, and loud shouting filtered through the thin walls of the dorms and poked and prodded at Shuichi’s ears as he and Kaito headed towards a flight of stairs. <i>I bet he’s just going to interrogate me about Kaede some more.</i> He let a breathy sigh escape him. <i>There’s not much to talk about, I mean, I barely know her. There was that time we worked together with Maki and Kaito, but we didn’t talk much… And when I leant her a pencil and her hand brushed against mine… GAH! Dammit! Stop thinking like that, she probably doesn’t even like you…</i></p><p>Shuichi’s boots clacked on the stairs and the noise echoed off the walls. It was oddly quiet, for a Thursday night near the end of the week. Maybe everyone just decided to stay in, like Maki or Tsumugi. He and Kaito chatted idly about this and that as Kaito texted someone- probably Maki, and they eventually found their way through campus.</p><p>The pair burst into the cool evening air. Despite the relatively early time, it was still dark outside. A deep blue sky enfolded on top of them, dark clouds circling like something out of a watercolour painting. Puffy white clouds formed from their breaths as the snow crunched underfoot. The pale, artificial light from streetlamps cast a soft glow on their faces as they waked. Shuichi took a breath.</p><p>“Hey, Kaito…?” he started.</p><p>“What is it, bro?” Kaito replied.</p><p>“How long did you like Maki before you… You know… Asked her out?” Shuichi asked awkwardly, looking downcast. Kaito fell quiet for a few moments, thinking. He even put a finger to his chin, for effect.</p><p>“Maki Roll… She has this kind of aura around her, you know. As soon as I laid my eyes on her, I was like, “I gotta get to know what makes that girl tick.” You get me?” Kaito said. “And it’s not just because she’s pretty.”</p><p>“I guess I can understand. Maki’s an interesting character,” Shuichi put in.</p><p>“Dropping the formalities, eh? I think you should call her ‘Maki’ more often. I’m sure she won’t mind,” Kaito suggested, shrugging.</p><p>Shuichi shook his head. “Leaving out the honourific- even occasionally -is casual enough.” He sighed, and glanced up at the sky. It wasn’t snowing, but the cloud coverage was dark and steely, promising precipitation later in the night.</p><p>“Sooo, what brought on that question? Thinking about Kaede too much?” Kaito teased, gently touching his shoulder. Shuichi cringed in embarrassment. Just talking about her made him feel all giddy inside.</p><p>“Yes, I mean no, I mean… Augh!” Frustration seeped through Shuichi’s words. “Yes, I want to hang out with her, and yes, I like her, but I don’t know much about her. I want to get to know her. Do I really like her, or am I tricking myself into liking her? Is she really cute and funny and smells nice or am I just idealizing her in my head?” Shuichi clawed at his cheeks and dragged his hands down. “Kaito, which is it? Help me! I’ve never had a girlfriend!”</p><p>“...I think you need a burger, my friend.” Kaito tightened his grip on Shuichi’s shoulder. “You’re overthinking it. Yes, Kaede is nice, and yes, she’s also pretty. I don’t think you’re imagining that. When you like a girl, or guy, or whoever, it makes you crazy. I think that’s what’s happening to you.” He blew a breath into the night air. “Just chill out.”</p><p>“I have never been chill, not once in my life,” Shuichi said.</p><p>“Oh. Well.” Kaito paused, listening to the sound of the crunching snow beneath them, glancing around at the lights from store signs glaring back at them. He smiled gently. “Slow it down, Shuichi. First you gotta talk to her.”</p><p>“Talk to her… Right.” Shuichi gulped, still freaking out on the inside. Maybe becuase of his internal freefall, he decided to make a promise that would kill him to keep. “I can do that. You can hold it to me. Tomorrow, I’m gonna talk to Kaede.” <i>Shit</i>. </p><p>“That’s what I like to hear from my sidekick.”</p><p>-</p><p>The heat that touched Shuichi’s body as he walked through the door to their local Harvey’s warmed him immediately, the cold leaving his reddened face, his breath turning invisible once again. The wind that had slicked past his body stopped and was replaced with the still air of the restaurant. </p><p>But, as Kaito and him entered...</p><p>“Yoohoo! Shuichi! Fancy meeting you here!”</p><p>A short boy with telltale messy, pointed dark hair and an obnoxiously bright purple jacket ran up to the pair immediately- followed by a slightly distressed looking boy with equally spiky hair. </p><p>“Uh, hey, Kokichi… Kiibo…” Shuichi mumbled, taking his hands out of his pockets and unbuttoning his coat. “What are you two doing here… Together?”</p><p>Kokichi pouted. “What, you think it’s so strange to see me and Kii-boy out together? You’re so rude, Shuichi!” He slung an arm around Kiibo’s shoulder and pulled him in tight, much to the other’s discomfort. “Kii-boy and I are the best of friends! Riiight?”</p><p>“Jump off a bridge,” Kiibo responded tiredly.</p><p>“What’s your damage, Kii-boy? I’m offended! Hmph!” Kokichi huffed, and yet still kept his arm around Kiibo.</p><p>“Well, we’re just coming here to eat. You two are probably the same, right?” Kaito explained.</p><p>“Actually, we just ate, and now-” Kiibo began, and was prematurely interrupted by an excited Kokichi.</p><p>“Now we’re going back to our dorm to hang out like best friends do!” he bubbled. “Kiibo and I are going to watch movies and eat popcorn and cry, together!” He grinned widely, like the Cheshire Cat. “It’s going to be sooo much fuuun!”</p><p>“Help me,” Kiibo whispered.</p><p>“Maybe I can ring up Rantaro, okay, Kii-boy? I’m sure he’d be soooo excited to join our little party, don’t you think?” Kokichi rocked back and forth on his feet, taking Kiibo with him. He looked more and more annoyed with each word Kokichi spoke. “Maybe he’ll bring me Pringles. Do you guys think Rantaro would buy me Pringles?”</p><p>“Ah, sorry to break it to you, but Rantaro is busy tonight…” Shuichi started, then trailed off. Kokichi balked at him.</p><p>“Why are you so well-versed in my beloved Rantaro’s whereabouts?” Kokichi asked suspiciously. “Could it be… Are you two seeing each other?” He gaped dramatically. “Wow, Shuichi, I never took you for that kind of guy!”</p><p>“U-Uh, that’s not what I meant at all!” Shuichi bit his lip. “He’s hanging out with Tsumugi… Not me.”</p><p>“Oh. Okay.” Kokichi’s mouth flattened into a line. “Tsumugi, huh? I’m gonna have to give her a piece of my mind tomorrow, for stealing my favourite side piece from me…”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure Rantaro is with her of his own volition, no stealing involved…” Shuichi pointed out, but Kokichi wasn’t listening as he bit down on his thumbnail.</p><p>“Oh well~! Kii-boy and I will just have fun together, without Rantaro!” he decided, brightening once again. He locked his arm around Kiibo.</p><p>“Please. Help me,” Kiibo repeated as Kokichi began to drag him off.</p><p>“Aren’t you so glad we’re roomies, Kii-baby? I am. I’m soo glad I met you, you’re, like, my favourite-...” Kokichi’s annoying chatter faded away as he swung open the door and began to leave. “Byas, Shuichi and Kaito~!” he called as he dragged a suffering Kiibo away.</p><p>“Poor Kiibo,” Kaito commented.</p><p>“Poor Kiibo,” Shuichi affirmed.</p><p>-</p><p>

[10:23 P.M] maki roll: You owe me big time, Space Man.<br/>

[10:26 P.M] Kaito Momota: hell yeah maki roll!<br/>
[10:26 P.M] Kaito Momota: what’s the verdict?<br/>
[10:27 P.M] maki roll: Well, Kaede got a tad bit tipsy on some champagne. While we were watching the movie, she kept saying that the main character was really cute “for some reason.” Then after a bit, she said, “ohhh, I know why! It’s because he looks like Shuichi!”<br/>
[10:28 P.M] Kaito Momota: dude, holy shit!<br/>
[10:28 P.M] maki roll: You can say that again.<br/>
[10:28 P.M] Kaito Momota: dude, holy shit!<br/>
[10:29 P.M] maki roll: Then I casually said, “oh, you think Shuichi is cute?” and she said, “yeahhh, that face of his is so cute! And he’s so shy it’s adorable!”<br/>
[10:29 P.M] maki roll: Maybe the alcohol enhanced her phrasing but I think the point still stands.<br/>
[10:30 P.M] Kaito Momota: that’s my girl!! YES WE HAVE CONFIRMATION COMMENCING LIFTOFF!! STEP ONE COMPLETE!<br/>
[10:30 P.M] maki roll: While we’re on the subject, Miu got slightly more than tipsy, and said, verbatim, “I would ride Shuichi into the sunset.” Her words, not mine.<br/>
[10:31 P.M] Kaito Momota: lovely<br/>
[10:31 P.M] Kaito Momota: anyways, shuichi is psyching himself up to talk to akamatsu tomorrow. he might be kept up all night by a girl but i will not let you have that victory over me<br/>
[10:32 P.M] maki roll: I’ve kept you up many a night before ;)<br/>
[10:32 P.M] Kaito Momota: ayyyyyyyyyy<br/>

  <b>February 10th - 4 Days Until Valentine’s Day</b>
</p><p>“Kaede, one o’clock.”</p><p>“Yes, Kaito, I can see her in my peripherals.”</p><p>Shuichi felt his nerves bubble up inside him. <i>She’s just a girl, cool your jets… </i>He inhaled sharply and tried to look straight ahead, but found that his eyes were glued to the floor. Kaito nudged him in the side. “She’s alone, dude. Time to make your move.”</p><p>Idle chitchat from other students surrounded the two as they moved closer to Kaede. Suddenly, Kaito cleared his throat and looked pointedly at Shuichi.</p><p>“I gotta go catch up with Maki Roll. See ya later, Shuichi!” he said, a tad loudly. Then he grinned, slapped Shuichi on the back and pushed him forward, and skirted around the other students and ran into the lecture hall. Shuichi paused in his tracks for a moment, then set his shoulders squarely forward and started walking.</p><p><i>She’s just a university student like you. And you’re kind of friends. No need to be nervous.</i> Those were the thoughts running through Shuichi’s head as he approached Kaede, who was fiddling with her backpack strap. Shuichi gripped his own nervously.</p><p>“Ah, h-hey, Kaede,” he started tentatively. Kaede’s head whipped up from her backpack and for a moment she looked startled, eyes wide. Then her face settled into a smile.</p><p>“Hey, Shuichi!” she said happily, still messing with her backpack. “How was your outing with Kaito last night?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. It was fun,” Shuichi said. “Um, do you need help with your backpack?” he asked, looking at anything other than Kaede’s face, refusing to meet her pretty eyes.</p><p>“Augh, no, the buckle is just stuck…” Kaede groaned and tried pulling at the strap. “Andddd… There!” The buckle came undone and Kaede fumbled with it for a moment, then clamped it on again. Then she straightened and smiled at Shuichi. His heart skipped a beat.</p><p>“So, did you get any, how did Kaito phrase it? Hotties?” Kaede giggled. She beckoned Shuichi closer and started walking towards the entrance to the hall. <i>Oh, alright. You’re doing good, Shuichi.</i></p><p>Shuichi felt heat begin to crawl up his neck. “Ah, no, nothing like that.” He scratched the back of his head nervously. “We did run into Kiibo and Kokichi, though, which is always… an experience.”</p><p>Kaede chuckled good-naturedly. “I can attest to that. Kiibo and I do homework together at least once a week, usually at his dorm because being in a girl’s dorm alone makes him nervous… But when Kokichi is there, we hardly get any work done. Last time, he was hanging out with this white-haired guy in the year above us. It was strange.”</p><p>“Strange? How so?” Shuichi asked. He found himself hanging on Kaede's every word, listening perhaps a tad too closely. He couldn’t help it… She just had some kind of energy surrounding her. An energy that made you feel at ease.</p><p>“Well, they were watching those hydraulic press videos,” Kaede explained, making some nonsensical hand gestures. “And crying. They watched one where one of those giant gummy bears got pressed and Kokichi screamed ‘big boy, no!’” She narrowed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>“Sounds like great fun.” Shuichi looked up and spotted Kaito talking to Maki. Their eyes met for a moment and Kaito flashed him a thumbs up. Blushing, Shuichi’s gaze turned back to the ground.</p><p>“When you have two boys cheering for the destruction of inanimate objects, doing your homework is nigh impossible,” Kaede sighed.</p><p>“I can imagine,” Shuichi chuckled nervously. “But I digress. How was your, um, girl’s night?”</p><p>Kaede brightened. “It was fun! We had popcorn and candy and stuff, and watched some old comedy movies. And Miu brought some champagne so we had a bit of that.” She paused and suddenly inhaled sharply. “Maki had a bit. I had some. Miu probably could have finished the whole bottle by herself.”</p><p>Shuichi felt a bit surprised, hearing that Kaede drank. It’s not like it was weird, they were all adults, and he even had a little when it struck his fancy. <i>She’s just… normal. Drinks alcohol like all other university kids.</i> “So I take it Miu was drunk.”</p><p>“Very,” Kaede tittered. Shuichi noticed that she and him were walking incredibly slowly as they drew closer to their seats, and Kaito and Maki’s interested gazes followed their every snail-like movement. <i>I wonder how that happened.</i> “She even asked me to play piano for her. And she hates listening to me play piano. And then she cried when I was finished.”</p><p>“Oh, you play piano?” Shuichi questioned, blinking. As he asked, Kaede’s eyes lit up, like she was a lightbulb that just gained 100 volts.</p><p>“I love the piano!” she exclaimed loudly. “Oh, sorry, maybe I shouldn’t be shouting.” The words bubbled out of her mouth like an erupting geyser. “Maki didn’t tell you? I play the piano all the time in our dorm, it must annoy her… She doesn’t say anything, though. Which is odd, I figure that listening to Piano Freak time and time again must get irritating! I get told that I’m pretty good, though. In fact, I have a gig playing at a local club on Fridays!” She clasped her hands together excitedly.</p><p>Seeing Kaede so passionate made Shuichi’s nervous smile grow wider, until it was fully genuine. She was intense, and her love for piano was so clearly raw and real, laid out for him to see. Her eyes sparkled as he talked, and Shuichi felt utterly captivated by her words.</p><p>“Augh, sorry! I just went on another tangent, I’m probably boring you…” Kaede looked disheartened, her cheeks turning pinkish in embarrassment.</p><p>“Er, n-no! No! You’re not!” Shuichi insisted fervently. At that point, they had stopped walking completely. He fiddled with his hands nervously, twiddling his thumbs. “I think it sounds interesting. I’d, um, like to hear you play piano, Kaede. Some time. If you’re okay with it.” His blush touched his ears, and when he dared to look up at Kaede again…</p><p>She looked dumbfounded, eyes widened, her cheeks flushed a noticeable red against her pale skin. “Oh, really?”  She blinked, seeming truly caught off guard. “I-If you want to hear little old Piano Freak play, I’d be okay with that!” she stuttered out. <i>Kaede Akamatsu doesn’t stutter.</i> “Here, let me give you my number!”</p><p>“Your <i>what</i>?” Shuichi echoed, shocked. Kaede hid her reddened face and started digging for her phone in her backpack. </p><p>“My number, duh. So you can call me when you want to hear the piano! I play tonight, actually!” she said quickly, rummaging through a small pocket in her bag. “Ah, found it!” She pulled out her phone, which has a pretty lavender case with some aesthetic bars of music on it.</p><p>Shuichi slipped his own out of his pocket and unlocked it, just to have a slightly overexcited Kaede grab it from him. “H-hey!” he protested, but to no avail. Kaede inputted her number, texted something to herself, and then handed back the phone with shaky hands. Her ringer went off and she smiled.</p><p>“There, now we have each other’s numbers!” she proclaimed.  Then she turned towards where Kaito and Maki previously were- and Shuichi noticed the two were now sitting in their assigned seats. In their place, Miu was standing, waving at Kaede and yelling something incoherent. “I gotta run. Bye, Shuichi!”</p><p>Then she scurried off to meet Miu, and the weight of the phone in Shuichi’s hand grew heavier as he stared at it. <i>Did I just get my crush’s phone number?</i> His heart jumped into his throat, and he found that he was unable to move. He was… frozen. Save for the rapid beating of his heart deep within him, bip-bopping a less than <i>steady thump-thump-thump,</i> he would have been certain that he would have died right then and there.</p><p>Heartbeat thrumming against his chest, the blushing Shuichi made his way towards Kaito, where his seat was. He felt like he was in a dreamlike state, his eyes out of focus, mind blank. He eventually found his chair and gently sat down, as Kaito’s hungry smile beamed at him from the side.</p><p>“Soo, you got her number?” he asked, fists clenched in excitement.</p><p>“Yeah…” Shuichi mumbled, his phone still open to his messages. Kaito peered at the screen with wide eyes.</p><p>“Hot damn, Shuichi! You’ve got game!” he whistled, impressed. “Step two, complete!”</p><p>“Step two? What was step one?” Shuichi asked, seemingly phasing back into reality. He blinked, watching Kaede talk with Maki and Miu. She spotted him peeping and gave him a wave. Shuichi weakly waved back, dissociating.</p><p>“Oh, er, don’t mind that,” Kaito said quickly. Shuichi gave him a perplexed look, but he refused to elaborate. “Good on ya, though, Shuichi. I didn’t think you had the balls.”</p><p>“Yeah, me neither,” Shuichi responded without an ounce of sarcasm in his words.</p><p>-</p><p>
  <b>February 10th, 2017</b>
</p><p>[9:43 A.M] Kaede: heyyy<br/>
[9:43 A.M] Kaede: I see youuu<br/>
[9:44 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: what a coincidence, i see you too.<br/>
[9:44 A.M] Kaede: :P<br/>
[9:44 A.M] Kaede: mister rule breaker over here. texting during the lecture is not allowed!<br/>
[9:45 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: oh really now?<br/>
[9:45 A.M] Kaede: hey I don’t make the rules, I only enforce them<br/>
[9:45 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: well, you’re not doing the greatest job rn miss rule enforcer<br/>
[9:45 A.M] Kaede: calling me out?? I cannot believe this<br/>
[9:45 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: better believe it, miss rule breaker<br/>
[9:46 A.M] Kaede: harsh!</p><p>In front of Shuichi, Kaede turned in her seat and stuck her tongue out playfully at Shuichi. For a moment, all oxygen in the lecture hall disappeared, and Shuichi was left breathless.</p><p>Then he realized that he hadn’t been taking notes, threw his phone down onto the table and started scribbling fervently in his notebook. Kaede, however, kept her phone unlocked, and upon receiving no response from Shuichi, flipped to a new contact.</p><p>[9:56 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: amami-kun. my dude. my man. my brother from another mother, if u will...<br/>
[9:57 A.M] avocado daddy: akamatsu-san? aren’t you in class?<br/>
[9:57 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: I mean<br/>
[9:57 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: yeah<br/>
[9:57 A.M] avocado daddy: ...akamatsu-san<br/>
[9:58 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: listen amami-kun this is important<br/>
[9:58 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: my thirst knows no curfew<br/>
[9:58 A.M] avocado daddy: come again?<br/>
[9:59 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: alright, rewind. you know the cute guy in my psychology class? the one who was with momota-kun yesterday when he came around while we were talking?<br/>
[9:59 A.M] avocado daddy: black hair, looks like he listens to mcr and cries?<br/>
[9:59 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: ...sure?<br/>
[9:59 A.M] avocado daddy: i know the one. saihara-kun if i’m not mistaken?<br/>
[10:00 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: yeah him! well I got his phone number! well.. I.. mean… I gave him mine first. but still! point still stands!!<br/>
[10:00 A.M] avocado daddy: proud of you, girl. though i’m surprised it took you so long.. usually you’re not shy like this.<br/>
[10:00 A.M] avocado daddy: remember in seventh grade when you asked out maizono-san when she was in eighth grade? you just up and went over to her and said so bluntly ‘wanna go to the spring dance?’<br/>
[10:01 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: you’re forgetting the part where she said yes<br/>
[10:01 A.M] avocado daddy: my point is, you were brave then, so why not now?<br/>
[10:01 A.M] Kaede Akamatsu: huh… I dunno! I guess saihara-kun is just different.</p><p>As this conversation was going on, unbeknownst to Shuichi, he was taking notes, hyperfocused on the lecturer’s words. It sapped him of all his willpower to not check his phone, or text Kaede back, or anything of the sort.</p><p>He could feel Kaito’s grin staring at the side of his face. He ignored it, and slumped down into his seat, carefully looping his letters and looking anywhere but the back of Kaede’s head. He sighed dramatically, for no particular reason- maybe releasing all the pent-up nervous energy he stored from talking to a girl, in the form of an exhale.</p><p><i>I’m still reeling over the fact that she gave me her number,</i> Shuichi thought to himself, the sentiment causing a warm feeling to blossom in his chest. <i>And she wants me to listen to her playing piano? Does that mean she wants to hang out with me? A-Alone?</i> The nerves that had finally settled in Shuichi flared to life at the thought.</p><p><i>I wonder how well she can play the piano. I remember Maki saying something about her playing a lot… </i>Shuichi wondered silently. <i>I bet she’s great</i>. He tapped his pencil lead on his notebook paper.</p><p>
  <i>But I’ll have to wait until class is over to talk to her some more.</i>
</p><p>-</p><p>“Okay, so, how did you get her number? I need a play by play,” Kaito demanded as soon as the lecture wrapped up. Shuichi hadn’t even begun to put his stuff in his knapsack when Kaito’s eager expression was upon him.</p><p>“Well, I just, you know, went up and talked to her,” Shuichi started, mumbling. “It was liberating.”</p><p>“Uh-huh. But how’d be get from casual convo to intimate phone number exchanging?” Kaito interrogated as he bagged his belongings.</p><p>“Um, we talked about what we did last night, and she mentioned that she played piano… So I told her I’d like to hear her play some time and she got excited and gave me her phone number.” Shuichi zipped up his backpack and slung it over his shoulder. “That’s it.”</p><p>Kaito grinned heartily and slapped Shuichi on the back. “I’m proud of you, dude, for being a real go-getter and talking to the girl you like. Last year, I don’t think the thought of doing such an act would have ever crossed your mind!”</p><p>“Probably not,” Shuichi admitted. “I also probably would not have told you if I had a crush, and let it fester away until it disappeared. Actually, that’s the way I dealt with most problems,” he added. </p><p>“Well, now you’re a brand new Shuichi and you’re gonna get yourself a brand new girlfriend!” Kaito said brightly. Shuichi flushed.</p><p>“Shhh, not so loud!” With his finger, he gestured towards Kaede, who was just about to leave. “And hey, she probably doesn’t like me the way I like her, so I won’t get myself a brand new girlfriend.” He looked at the floor shyly.</p><p>“Whatever you say,” Kaito mused. “I think you have a pretty good chance, though.”</p><p>“How are you always so confident? And how do you always believe in me, even when I’m being a sad sack of potatoes?” Shuichi asked, leading Kaito out of the lecture hall. Momora stroked his goatee thoughtfully, and after a moment of quiet thought, spoke.</p><p>“Well, I just believe that if you want something, you can get it!” he replied cheerily. “You want to date Kaede, right?” Shuichi scratched his cheek and blushed. “I think that you can definitely do that. And if she doesn’t like you that way, which I don’t know how she wouldn’t because you’re awesome, I think you could become really close with her anyways.” Shuichi gaped. “I think you can do it, so that’s all that matters!”</p><p>“Oh, u-uh… Th-thank you, Kaito,” Shuichi murmured, his face red. Kaito beamed at him.</p><p>“What kind of hero would I be if I didn’t believe in my sidekick one-hundred percent?” Kaito asked, giving Shuichi a thumbs up. “With that being said, I totally think you can woo Kaede.”</p><p>“Thanks, Kaito. Your support means a lot.” <i>I can’t believe we’re getting so mushy over my dumb crush.</i> A small smile crossed Shuichi’s face. <i>Still, it’s good to know that Kaito always has my back.</i> The pair chatted idly as they headed out of the hall.</p><p>“Hey, Shuichi! Over here!” Shuichi’s head whipped up and he noticed Kaede waving at him. His eyes widened and he felt Kaito nudge him forward. He took care not to trip on his feet as he made his way over to the group- there was Rantaro again, standing at Kaede’s side, along with Miu and Maki, and two other students, Angie and Korekiyo.</p><p>“Hello, hello, Shuichi and Kaito!” Angie chirped. Everyone else greeted the two newcomers. Kaito wandered over to Maki and stood at her side, placing an arm around her waist.</p><p>“Oh, uh, hey guys,” Shuichi said flatly as Kaito and Maki shared an intimate look. Kaede clapped her hands together.</p><p>“We were discussing plans for tonight and wondered if you were free? You said you wanted to hear me play the piano, and I play at the club tonight, sooo…?” Kaede trailed off, waiting eagerly for a response and leaning slightly in towards Shuichi. Rantaro watched her with a bemused expression.</p><p>“That sounds really fun!” Kaito said. Shuichi nodded, unable to find his voice all of a sudden. Kaede smiled joyfully. Her grin made the room ten times brighter.</p><p>“Kaede is a lovely pianist. I’m sure you’ll enjoy her playing, Shuichi,” Korekiyo put in. Angie hopped on her feet.</p><p>“Yes, yes, Shuichi! It would be a joy to have you accompany us!” Angie exclaimed excitedly, clapping her hands together and swinging them from side to side. Korekiyo rested a hand on her shoulder to steady her.</p><p>“It’d be my pleasure to have you both as guests,” Kaede said, looking straight at Shuichi as she spoke. Shuichi’s heartbeat was rapidly increasing in speed within his chest, and he stared dumbfounded into Kaede’s eyes.</p><p>“Um, y-yeah, we’ll definitely be there,” he finally said, eyes glued to Kaede’s face.</p><p>“Hey, Mumbles, speak up, and keep it in your pants while you’re at it,” Miu said, crossing her arms over her chest. “Jesus fucking Christ, you’ve been staring at Kaede like you wanna stick it in her all day.”</p><p>Shuichi was about to object when Korekiyo spoke up. “Anyways, I’m sure you two will be needing the address,” he interjected calmly, as if Miu never opened her mouth (though Shuichi and Kaede were both clearly affected, judging from the blush that had crossed both their faces).</p><p>“A-Ah yes, of course!” Kaede spluttered loudly, perhaps to compensate for the awkwardness she was feelings. She grabbed her phone and started typing furiously as Miu wore a shit-eating grin, clearly satisfied with her input. Korekiyo glared at her. </p><p>“O-kay, so.” After a while, Kaede cleared her throat and showed her phone to both Shuichi and Kaito, which displayed a map of the route to the club. “It’s about fifteen minutes if you want to walk, and it’s on the corner of Leeway and Striton. It’s this pretty big place called Titty Typhoon. Don’t mind the name, it’s just a music venue slash bar.” Kaede shrugged. “I’ll text you the details later, Shuichi!”</p><p>“Oh, okay,” Shuichi said.</p><p>“Thanks for inviting us, Kaede,” Kaito thanked. “And I’m guessing that all of you guys are coming tonight?”</p><p>“Ha, nope! I’ve got plans with Kiibo,” Miu laughed. “Sorry, sluts, I know it’ll be hard to go on without me,” she trumpeted, placing a hand to her chest in a sign of self-inflation</p><p>“You overestimate your importance,” Korekiyo muttered darkly.</p><p>“The rest of us are coming, obviously. I wouldn’t miss one of Kaede’s performances for the world,” Rantaro added, his hand coming to rest on Kaede’s arm. She chuckled, and an uncomfortable feeling of envy unfolded in Shuichi. (Maybe if Kaito informed him that Rantaro didn’t swing that way, he would feel less threatened). “Kokichi and I have plans beforehand, but I doubt he’ll accompany me to the club.”</p><p>“Kaede is a wonderful player! Angie loves to visit the club when she’s not busy making art with Atua,” Angie chirped.</p><p>“Then it’s decided!” Kaede exclaimed. “I’ll see both of you at seven o’clock!”</p><p>Maki shifted in Kaito’s arms. “I’ll drive you two,” she offered. Kaito planted a kiss on the top of her head.</p><p>“Thanks, Maki Roll,” he said graciously. Maki embarrassedly gripped one of her pigtails and pulled at it, running her fingers through the hair. “Anyways, we’ll be on our way, and we’ll see you lot tonight.” He winked. Charming. He looked down at Maki and whispered to her, “come with?”</p><p>After a moment’s thought, she responded. “Sure.” She waved at the group. “Bye guys.”</p><p>“Bye Maki and Kaito! And Shuichi, can’t wait to see you tonight!” Kaede said. The rest of the group exchanged their farewells, with Angie cheerily going on about her excitement and Rantaro telling Shuichi he ‘would love the show.’</p><p>Maki laced her fingers with Kaito’s and they began to make their way down the hall. “Hey, Shuichi,” Maki started.</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Your attraction to Kaede is incredibly obvious,” she pointed out. Shuichi’s blood ran cold.</p><p>“You really think s- W-wait, what are you talking about?” he began, then quickly diverted his phrasing. Maki blinked at him, unconvinced. Shuichi shook his head. <i>Nothing goes over Maki’s head.</i> “I guess you’ve figured it out, huh?”</p><p>“I’ve known for a while now,” Maki said.</p><p>“Did Kaito tell you?” Shuichi asked accusingly.</p><p>Maki tightened her grip on Kaito’s hand. “Nope. You’ve just been drooling over her for a while, so I interpolated.” She sighed. “For what it’s worth, I think you have a chance with her.”</p><p>“Huh? Really?” Shuichi asked, gripping the tail-end of his backpack strap. He felt a little awkward, walking with his two friends who were holding hands while they discussed his love life… Or lack thereof. “You think so?”</p><p>Maki’s eyebrows pulled together. “Do you need glasses, Shuichi? She gave you her phone number with little to no reason as to why and just invited you to come see her perform. Have you ever seen her do that to anyone else?”</p><p>“I guess not,” Shuichi admitted. “But what about Rantaro-”</p><p>“God, you are so dense,” Maki said, rolling her eyes. Shuichi glared at her, confused.</p><p>“What do you mean?” he asked, perplexed. Maki chuckled so softly it was nearly inaudible. </p><p>“You’re hopeless.” She leaned further into Kaito.</p><p>“Kaito, what is she talking about?” Shuichi frowned. Kaito ran a hand through his mop of hair. </p><p>“I think Maki Roll is just saying that you should open your eyes and stop over-thinking,” he put in. Maki dipped her head slightly.</p><p>“Shuichi, Kaede isn’t some sort of goddess. She’s a university student like you, Kaito, and I.” She brushed a strand of hair off her face with her free hand. “You should be more confident in yourself. I think that Kaede is rather fond of you.”</p><p>“Oh, u-uh… Sure.” Shuichi rubbed the back of his neck. <i>When did today turn into ‘Cheer Shuichi up power hour?’</i> “Thanks, Maki.”</p><p>“...” Maki was silent.</p><p>-</p><p>
  <b>February 10th, 2017</b>
</p><p>[6:41 P.M] Kaede: hey hey saihara-kun<br/>
[6:41 P.M] Kaede: you need directions??<br/>
[6:42 P.M] Shuichi Saihara: nah we’re good, harukawa-san knows the way<br/>
[6:42 P.M] Kaede: awesome! see you guys soon!<br/>
[6:42 P.M] Shuichi Saihara: we’re about to get going<br/>
[6:42 P.M] Kaede: okay, I’ll be waiting! xx</p><p>Shuichi tried to stop the blush rising to his face at the sight of her signoff. KiSsEs?? He slid his phone into his back pocket. He ran a wet comb through his fringe, staring at himself in the mirror. He was trying to make himself look as cool as possible- partly to impress Kaede, and partly because he hadn’t been to an actual club for a long time, and he forgot how he was supposed to dress at one.</p><p>“Shuichi! Get your ass in gear, we’re about to leave!”</p><p>“Give me a second, Kaito!” Shuichi yelled from inside the bathroom. He grabbed a bottle of cologne- <i>parfum de glace</i> -from the bathroom counter and sprayed a bit on his wrist, then patted it on his shirt. He took a deep breath, then pushed open the door and stepped out.</p><p>Kaito let out a long, low whistle. “You’re looking good tonight, Shuichi!” he commented. Shuichi scratched his cheek in embarrassment. </p><p>“Ah, you think so?” He looked down at his outfit- a pair of black jeans (that weren’t skinny for once), and a soft, blueish-grey t-shirt that fit nicely but he hadn’t worn for a while. In addition, he was wearing black flats in place of his usual grey sneakers.</p><p>“You clean up nice,” Maki added. She was wearing dark blue jeans and a puffy red parka. Kaito pouted, pointing at his own outfit (a modest purple plaid shirt and pale blue jeans).</p><p>“Where’s my compliment?” he asked. Maki rolled her eyes affectionately and gave him a peck on the cheek.</p><p>“You also look good.” Kaito beamed.</p><p>“Alright, are we ready?” he asked. Shuichi ignored the fact that his stomach was roiling with nerves and nodded his head firmly. Maki jangled her keys in her coat pocket.</p><p>“Let’s get going, then,” she stated, and pushed open the door to their dorm. Shuichi grabbed his coat and hurried out of the room, bursting out into the hallway. His mind was filled with anxious thoughts, now that it was finally settling in his head that he was <i>actually going to go see his crush perform.</i> How did this even happen? He smoothed his palm over his hair again.</p><p>As Kaito locked the door, he leaned in close to Maki. “Do you really think that Kaede likes Shuichi?” he whispered. Maki put a finger to her chin in thought.</p><p>“People are… weird, with the way they go about displaying their emotions. I feel like things would be easier for Shuichi if he just told Kaede how he felt,” Maki reasoned. “But yeah, I meant what I said earlier. Did you think I would lie to Shuichi?” When Kaito didn’t answer, Maki sighed and went on. “Kaede is clearly, well, intrigued by Shuichi, and let’s be honest, Shuichi is a pretty quiet guy. He’s not one to attract much attention, especially from a girl like Kaede.”</p><p>“Harsh, but I see what you’re going for,” Kaito replied, glancing at Shuichi, who seemed to be mentally preparing himself a little ways down the hall. “Yeah, I think she likes him, too. It’s just a hunch I have.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>-</p><p>“Ah, welcome, welcome.”</p><p>Rantaro was brandishing a charming smile and sporting a pale green off-both-shoulders sweater and a white tank top underneath. “We have a table over by the piano,” he said, gesturing over to where Korekiyo and Angie were sitting, deep in discussion. “Kaede will be back in a moment.”</p><p>“Thanks, dude,” Kaito said. Shuichi shrugged off his jacket and clung nervously to Kaito’s side as the trio made their way over to the table. Maki leaned in to the two of them.</p><p>“This place is a lot classier than I thought it would be, for a place called Titty Typhoon,” she noted. Shuichi nodded in agreement, looking around the establishment. The bar area was off to one side, well-furnished and clean looking. The main lobby area they were standing in had a shiny, dark wooden floors with red and golden wallpaper. There were groups of chairs and tables with a large grand piano at the centre atop a stage, and the whole room was lit with atmospheric paper wall lamps that gave the area a soft, yellow glow.</p><p>“Do you think Kaede would perform at a garbage venue?” Kaito questioned. Maki tipped her head to the side.</p><p>“Hey, hey, everyone!” Angie chirped as the three approached the table. She didn’t appear to have dressed up for the occasion, as she was simply wearing a yellow cardigan and white shirt. “Oh, all three of you look so lovely tonight! How wonderful!”</p><p>“It’s my pleasure to greet all of you on this fine night,” Korekiyo added.</p><p>“Uh, thanks,” Shuichi mumbled, and sat down. Kaito slid into the seat beside him and Maki pulled one up.</p><p>“Oh, you three have arrived!”</p><p>Kaede stepped out of the backstage area, a look of mild surprise on her pretty face. Shuichi clenched his teeth as he saw her because <i>hot damn</i> she looked good and Shuichi could only handle so much before he would explode.</p><p>She was wearing a dress, for one, a pink and black number that fit her… very nicely, Shuichi noticed. He swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat. Also, it was strapless. Was it hot in the club or was it just Shuichi? He pulled at the collar of his shirt and coughed quietly. His face began to prickle with warmth</p><p>“I’m happy you guys actually showed up, ha…” Kaede began, twirling a strand of hair with her finger. “I wanted to get your opinion on my outfit… Do you guys like this dress?” She spread out her arms and gave a little spin. Shuichi bit his lip. “Rantaro bought it for me for what he would describe as ‘saucy occasions,’ and I like it, but it’s not the kind of thing I’d usually wear, you get me? So I’m feeling a little shy.”</p><p>“You look fine, Kaede,” Maki insisted. Kaito gave her a thumbs up.</p><p>“Yeah, Kaede! No need to be self-conscious. You look awesome!” he flattered.</p><p>That’s when Shuichi noticed both Maki and Kaito were staring at him. “Oh, um, you look really pretty. Great. Pretty great. Uh.” Kaito snickered softly as Shuichi spluttered and stumbled.</p><p>“Thanks, you guys,” Kaede said, smiling. She put a hand to her face. “And does my makeup look okay? I’m not used to wearing a lot and I’m worried I’m going to smudge it.” </p><p>“Oh, Kaede, you look gorgeous! There is no need to fret!” Angie piped up. “Your makeup is very well done!”</p><p>“Yeah, Kaede.” Rantaro suddenly appeared to the side of the blonde-haired girl, placing a hand on her (exposed) shoulder. <i>This cool dude needs to stop infringing on my turf.</i> “You look, how do they say it, <i>bangin’</i>?”</p><p>“Ah, Rantaro, I assume that you helped Kaede with her makeup, yes?” Angie asked. Rantaro scratched his head, looking… embarrassed? Shuichi’s eyes widened.</p><p>“Yeah, I did. I don’t know why she came to me, though,” he said.</p><p>“D’oy, it’s because you’re better than doing makeup than I am!” Kaede exclaimed, bringing her hands together happily. “And I’m not even mad about it.”</p><p>“Well, I mean-”</p><p>“Kaede! Showtime!”</p><p>A grey haired man who looked maybe thirty popped out of backstage and pointed at Kaede, interrupting the conversation. She spun away from the group and bowed slightly. “Yes, Munakata-san!” He gave her a firm look, though he was smiling, and disappeared again. Kaede faced her friends.</p><p>“Sorry, guys, but I have to play now. Hope you enjoy the show.” She winked, and strode towards the shiny black piano. Shuichi watched her, enraptured by her movements. She smoothed out her dress and took a seat.</p><p>She cleared her throat and smiled brightly. “I hope everyone is having a good night tonight,” she mused, looking over the people in the crowd. There was a number of patrons- as it was a Friday night. Shuichi wondered how Kaede remained so happy and poised while she had so many eyes on her. She ran her fingers over the piano, quickly punching out a scale. “I think tonight I’ll start with a Waltz in A minor from Chopin. It’s a lovely song, like water flowing down a river,” she explained, eyes sparkling. Shuichi smiled and leaned over the table.</p><p>Kaede took a breath, and bent her fingers over the keys.</p><p>Then she began to play.</p><p>Now, Shuichi wasn’t typically one for classical music- he usually just listened to whatever was on the radio at any given time. But as soon as Kaede began to play, he was sucked in. His attention was rapt, glued to her figure as she played and smiled. The song wasn’t very fast- it was just as described, “water flowing down a river.” It was slow and melodic, the sound of the keys resounding through the entire lobby, clear and beautiful. </p><p>Kaede was completely invested in her work, gaze never leaving the keys. Shuichi watched her, enthralled. Maybe it was because the music was pretty, or because the player was downright gorgeous- but he couldn’t look away.</p><p>Before he knew it, the song had ended.</p><p>The lobby erupted into applause. Or maybe Shuichi just did- he wasn’t sure, as he was deafened by the sound of his own clapping. Kaede sighed and stretched out her arms, looking straight at the table- and straight at Shuichi. She grinned so widely that his heart sped up immediately, and he put a hand to his chest. Be still. </p><p>“Thank you, thank you! Now, this little ditty is…”</p><p>Kaede launched into another song, and Kaito decided to slip away and get the group drinks while Shuichi stayed behind and gawked at Kaede some more. The group chatted idly and watched the girl play as hours of nighttime waned away.</p><p>Kaito took every opportunity possible to poke fun at Shuichi.</p><p>Time passed, and Shuichi found himself surprised that he was enjoying himself as much as he was. He had been so nervous to come to the club that it had worn him out, and was content with the fact that everything had gone well. Kaede was an amazing player, as promised, and Angie and Korekiyo were both interesting company. And despite his misgivings, he even grew to really like Rantaro- he was just so charming, goddammit!</p><p>Eventually Kaede came to her final song. She sighed and cracked her knuckles. “This song is one of my favourites. It’s called Clair de Lune, by Debussy. It’s a soothing, melancholy song, that reminds you of a calm night on the water.” She smiled and began to play. A somber, slow melody filled the area, and Shuichi stopped all conversation to listen to her last song of the night.</p><p>Emotion contorted Kaede’s face as she played, and that’s what Shuichi was most fascinated by. She was so incredibly passionate about the piano, and it showed through in every beat, every movement, every breath she took as she played.</p><p>At least, that was the psychology that ran through Shuichi’s head as he stared at her with a flushed face like a schoolboy thinking that he was experiencing love for the first time. He got to wax poetic in his mind while looking at a cute girl, so it was a win-win situation.</p><p>Shuichi applauded the loudest out of everyone in the lobby, he thought. </p><p>Kaede stood up and curtsied. “Thank you everyone! And have a lovely night!” The crowd cheered as she walked off the stage and towards her friends. Rantaro met her halfway and wrapped her in a hug.</p><p>“Amazing as always,” he chuckled, ruffling her hair. <i>I wonder what it’d be like to hug Kaede</i>. Kaede reciprocated the hug.</p><p>“Aww, thanks, Rantaro!” she said, wiping her face. </p><p>“Oh, Kaede, are you crying?” Maki asked. Kaede shook her head gently and drew her wrist across her face.</p><p>“It’s just… Hearing people applaud for you is such a good feeling, you know?” She waved her hands around in the air. “When they clap, I know I made them feel good. I made someone happy, just by playing the piano. And I think that’s awesome,” she sniffed, and looked pointedly at Shuichi. “Especially you. You were clapping the loudest of them all.”</p><p>“A-ah…” Shuichi reddened. “Your playing was incredible, Kaede.”</p><p>Kaede touched her chest gratefully. “Thank you, Shuichi.”</p><p>Their words lingered for a moment, as no one spoke up after the exchange. Kaito smirked, and even Maki looked a bit smug.</p><p>“As usual, your playing was beautiful, Kaede.” <i>Thank you, Korekiyo, for breaking that awkward silence. I love you.</i> “You captured the hearts of everyone in the lobby. It was quite interesting to watch.”</p><p>“Yeah, you were great up there,” Maki commened. Angie hopped on the tips of her toes.</p><p>“Yes, yes, amazing, Kaede! Atua thinks so, too!” she exclaimed.</p><p>“Aw, you guys are s-so sweet.” Kaede’s voice cracked slightly as she spoke. Rantaro wrapped one of his arms around her shoulder.</p><p>“Kaede always gets mushy after a performance,” he said. Kaede rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I guessssss,” she groaned. “Well, I dunno if any of you guys are gonna stick around, but I usually leave soon after my performance is done.” She adjusted the top part of her dress. Shuichi, well, he bit the inside of his cheek because he cannot handle anything.</p><p>“Angie and Korekiyo are definitely staying and partying some more! Right, Korekiyo?” Angie said, chipper as always. Korekiyo narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“Well, I suppose I can’t just leave you here alone,” he conceded. Maki reached for Kaito’s hand.</p><p>“We’ll leave, then. I’m guessing you’re coming with us, Shuichi?” she asked, glancing at the black-haired boy. He nodded.</p><p>“Thanks for having us, Kaede. This was fun,” he said. Kaede approached the three of them and-</p><p>
  <i>WHOA!</i>
</p><p>She grinned as she wrapped the trio in a large hug. “I’m so happy you enjoyed it!” <i>Holy crap she’s so close to me I can feel her warmth her body is liTERALLY TOUCHING MINE OH MY GOD-</i> “You guys are definitely welcome to come again!” <i>Oh yeah, the dress she’s wearing is sTrApLeSs.</i></p><p>Kaede drew back, her smile bright and dazzling. Shuichi’s heart thumped against his chest at a million miles an hour, blood rushing to his face and <i>only his face</i>. “...” He tried to say something but his train of thought had been completely derailed at that point.</p><p>“I’ll see you guys later, okay?” she said, and started away from the group. “Let’s go, Rantaro!”</p><p>Rantaro winked as he left. “See you guys on the flipside.”</p><p>The two made their way out of the lobby as Shuichi was stood, frozen, heart racing. Kaito gently touched his shoulder. “Heyyyy, Shuichi? You in there? Shuichi?” He tried rocking him back and forth, to no avail.</p><p>“Hey, Shuichi, get it together,” Maki said, and slapped his arm. Shuichi flinched, and then opened his mouth.</p><p>“Is this what it feels like when you die?”</p>

  <b>February 11th - Three Days Until Valentine's Day</b>
</p>
<p>Lazy sunlight is what gently awoke Shuichi the following morning. Rays of light streamed through his and Kaito’s less than opaque curtains, casting shadows on his pale face. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly in an attempt to feign slumber, covering his face with the back of his hand. Eventually he rose from his mattress and stretched his arms above his head, mouth gaping in a large yawn. </p>
<p>“Morning, Kaito,” he mumbled as he rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>Kaito yawned loudly from the top bunk. Shuichi heard the sound of blankets rustling as he responded. “Moooorninggg, Shuichi,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>Shuichi rolled back onto his side. His thoughts went back once again to the night prior- Kaede’s performance, hanging out with his friends, the way she felt against him as they hugged… He squeezed his eyes shut tightly, trying to block out anything indecent that may have found its way into his mind.</p>
<p>The night had felt like a dream- wonderful, like it couldn’t be real. But he still felt the pain in his stomach, weakened by nerves, and the way his heart sped up when Kaede crossed his thoughts. He smiled pleasantly as he glanced over towards the alarm clock in his room- 8:17 A.M. </p>
<p>He fumbled around with his hand, reaching for his phone on the bedside table. He grabbed it and brought it to his face, turning it on. Several notifications greeted him, glaring at him from the bright screen, and he winced. Shuichi scrolled through them for a few moments before his finger stopped at one.</p>
<p>
  <b>February 11th, 2017</b>
</p>
<p>[10:12 P.M] Kaede: hey saihara-kun! just wanted to say thank you again for coming to see the show! it meant a lot and I’m glad you liked it! &lt;3</p>
<p>After he took a moment to take a deep breath and clutch his chest, Shuichi opened the notification and responded.</p>
<p>[8:18 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: ah it was no problem! thanks for having us, it was fun! :)</p>
<p>He swallowed the lump in his throat. <i>She probably sent a message like that to everyone who came,</i> he thought to himself, trying to squander the giddy excitement he felt spring to life in his gut. </p>
<p>After a slightly dramatic groan of defeat, Kaito also grabbed his phone from the depths of his blankets. Some people say that it’s dangerous to sleep with your phone in a five to ten foot radius of your head, but Kaito wasn’t really perturbed, because science is a liar sometimes. He flicked it on and saw some notifications.</p>
<p>“Hey Shuichi, did you get a text from Kaede?” he asked, opening his own message from her.</p>
<p>“Ah… Yeah, why?” Shuichi answered, opening some of his other texts. “What did yours say?”</p>
<p>Kaito rolled over and held his phone over the edge of his bunk, jutting his arm down to Shuichi. The black haired boy squinted, peering at the screen.</p>
<p>[10:16 P.M] Kaede: hey momota-kun thanks for coming tonight w harukawa-san and saihara-kun! I’m glad you had fun!</p>
<p>Shuichi pressed his phone to his lips, hiding part of his face. He felt the cool glass of the screen rub against his skin as he replied. “Um, yeah, she said the same thing to me.” He reddened in spite of himself.</p>
<p><i>Heart emoticon heart emoticon heart emoticon CALM YOURSELF SHUICHI!</i> Thoughts buzzed through his mind as he lied on his back, suddenly very aware of the wrinkles in his blankets pressing against his back. He slowly sat up, rubbing the back of his head and ruffling his hair. The sound of shifting sheets above him told him that Kaito was doing the same.</p>
<p>“So, what’s the plan for today?” Shuichi asked as a disheveled-looking Kaito climbed down from his bunk, sans shirt. </p>
<p>“I’ll ask Maki Roll if she wants to come over, if that’s cool with you,” he yawned as he hopped onto the ground. “Lemee hop in the shower first.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, of course,” Shuichi replied, watching Kaito leave through heavy-lidded eyes. “Though I don’t understand how you can shower in the morning. Weekends are for doing nothing and you’re too crunched for times on school days.”</p>
<p>Kaito paused momentarily, stretching his arms above his head. “Cleansing the self of sin before the day begins,” he said, not directly addressing any of Shuichi’s points. He lumbered away and Shuichi stared after him, perplexed.</p>
<p>“Alright,” he muttered to himself as the distant sound of rushing water filled the quiet morning ambience. Kaito shut the door to the bathroom and Shuichi kept himself occupied by scrolling through Twitter and other related news feeds.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of the above activity, deciding he didn’t want to depress himself further with politics, he chose to rise from his bed with a groan and get dressed. Maki was his friend, sure, but if she was going to come over he didn’t want to look like he just woke up.</p>
<p>He made quick work of changing out of his pajama bottoms and into a pair of blue skinny jeans, and traded his white tank for a black and white baseball shirt. He ran his hands through his mussed up hair, realizing he couldn’t really do much about it while Kaito was still occupying the bathroom.</p>
<p>The sound of the shower from the other room came to a stop as Shuichi was opening their window, breathing in the cold, fresh air. Kaito stumbled out with a towel wrapped around his waist and another around his head.</p>
<p>“It’s chilly as hell out here,” he lamented, fiddling with his towel.</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah, I suppose,” Shuichi mumbled, making his way to his bed and starting to make it. He pulled his blankets to the edges of his mattress.</p>
<p>“Don’t turn around. I’m getting changed! I know that it’s hard to ignore this, but you have to fight through it,” Kaito chuckled. Shuichi’s eyebrows knit in amusement as he fluffed up his pillow. <i>If one was to tell 15 year old Shuichi that his older self would be able to ...control himself while another guy changed in the same vicinity as him, he would have been spontaneously combusted,</i> he thought to himself, bemused.</p>
<p>As Shuichi folded his blanket over, Kaito spoke. “Alright, you’re good, dude.”</p>
<p>“Good timing,” said Shuichi as he turned around, greeted by a Kaito dressed in sweatpants and a white t-shirt. “Fancy outfit,” he commented.</p>
<p>“Thanks, bro,” Kaito said graciously. Shuichi smiled as his roommate started back to the bathroom, tangling his fingers in his wet hair. Shuichi was used to his hair down, as he saw it like that often in the mornings, but it was such a far-cry from his gelled-up and tall regular style.</p>
<p>Shuichi followed him down the hall and into the salle de bain. Kaito’s blow-dryer was already plugged in and Shuichi ambled past him and retrieved his straightener from their shared shelf.</p>
<p>The two stood side by side as the noise from Kaito’s hair dryer filled the small space and Shuichi tapped his fingers on the countertop, waiting for the straightener to heat up. He ran a damp comb through his hair, frowning at the sticky-uppy parts of it.</p>
<p>Eventually, with a grand sigh, Kaito shut off his dryer and started to comb aggressively through his hair, and the only sounds were Shuichi’s straightener clamping shut every few moments and Kaito grunting as he destroyed his hair with a fruity-smelling gel. Shuichi watched his friend with a small smirk from the mirror.</p>
<p>“What’s on the agenda for today? Other than hanging out with Maki, I mean. Are we just gonna stay here or…?” he started, then trailed off, waiting for a response. Kaito did up his hair at an angle and smiled at himself in the mirror, washing off his hands in the sink.</p>
<p>“We can hang here. It’s soooo cooooold outside, Shuichi,” he said, almost musically. Shuichi blew a stray strand of blueish hair out of his face. He watched with concern as a devilish smile suddenly crossed his roommate’s face, his eyes lighting up.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you’re thinking but I’d like to ask you to stop preemptively,” Shuichi said warily. Kaito rubbed his hands together and feigned innocence.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking… If Kaede wasn’t busy today, I could invite her over too…” Kaito said, smirking. Shuichi set down his straightener with a bang.</p>
<p>“Uh, er, absolutely not,” he stuttered. </p>
<p>Kaito groaned. “You’re so boring. You have to make an effort to get a girl to like you.”</p>
<p>“H-hey! I’ve been making an effort!” Shuichi objected. “And weren’t you the one who kept saying that you’re sure she, uh, likes me?” He started with an accusatory tone and quickly faltered when it came to discussing the crush. </p>
<p>Kaito grinned and ruffled Shuichi’s newly straightened hair. “I’m just joshin’ you, dude. Thought you mind want to get some quality Kaede time, you know, Maki Roll and I could leave you alone…” he hummed. Shuichi unplugged his straightener with vigor.</p>
<p>“Kaito!” he yelled. Kaito smiled at his dismay. </p>
<p>“You’re lucky that you’re good-looking because damn, bro, you’re shy as hell,” he said teasingly and left the bathroom, leaving Shuichi red-faced and alone.</p>
<p>Shuichi sighed as he put his straightener back in the closet. “What am I going to do with him?” he muttered to himself. Kaito could probably say the same about him.</p>
<p>After a couple more comb-throughs and splashing water on his face (and maybe applying false eyelashes, the world will never know), Shuichi walked out of the bathroom.</p>
<p>Kaito glanced up from his phone upon his re-entrance. “Maki Roll said she’d be over at eleven, to make sure that we actually eat a proper lunch and not just, I dunno, carbonated pepperette sticks.”</p>
<p>“Your choice of lunch worries me greatly,” Shuichi said.</p>
<p>“I eat fine!” Kaito insisted, pocketing his phone. “In fact, I’m going to head to the kitchen and grab something. What do you want?” </p>
<p>“Ah, no, I’m alright…” Shuichi told him. Kaito tapped his head.</p>
<p>“An apple it is, then. You have to eat and get your blood sugar up in the mornings, you know,” he explained, somewhat sternly. Shuichi tugged at his shirt.</p>
<p>“Okay, Kaito…” he mumbled, a little embarrassed but also grateful for Kaito’s insistence. </p>
<p>“I’m off then.” Kaito took a step towards the door, then paused. “Set up some video games or something, we have a solid two hours and like fifteen minutes or so before Maki Roll’s scheduled arrival.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Kaito, I got it,” Shuichi promised. Kaito opened the door with flourish and closed it with a hard bang.</p>
<p>Shuichi watched him go, a sudden smile crossing his face. <i>I’m really glad that I have a friend like Kaito.</i></p>
<p>As he turned on the T.V the two shared (which wasn’t all that impressive- it was larger than a box T.V but definitely nowhere near a flat screen) he reminisced about the events that lead him and Kaito to be friends. Ninth grade- terrified. Scary new high school, and everyone was so much bigger than him. His homeroom was geography, with assigned seating nonetheless. He was put beside a kid with a galaxy print backpack who looked like a troublemaker, and immediately told to discuss everything they knew about maps.</p>
<p>Shuichi was kind of intimidated by his teacher- she had an angular face and narrow eyes. Okay, maybe “kind of intimidated” was an understatement. He was downright terrified.</p>
<p>Then the troublemaker leaned in close to him and whispered “this teacher’s kind of a tightass. Who pissed in her coffee?” and the rest was history.</p>
<p>Shuichi smiled softly as he recalled the day. Kaito was amazing, his pillar for the first few scary weeks of high school, and he was miraculously in all of his classes to boot. He remembered when Kaito punched a guy who pushed him into the wall square in the jaw (he got suspended, but he promised it was worth it) and when he sat with him for an hour in the cold, dark night during a part calming him down after an anxiety attack.</p>
<p>And when they met Maki in grade ten, it was like they both found a part of themselves that they couldn’t find in each other. For Shuichi, he was ever grateful to have a down to earth, no nonsense friend that pulled no punches and told it like it was. For Kaito, he had found his other half… Or other third, rather. Shuichi was never sure when his friend’s feelings for Maki turned from platonic to something else entirely, but the two were somehow perfect for each other despite being polar opposites. </p>
<p>Shuichi silently reprimanded himself for getting so mushy as he set up their two controllers. </p>
<p>Soon Kaito returned and plunked down in front of the T.V, holding an apple, a banana, and two pieces of toast. How he balanced all of it without the food tumbling from his hands, Shuichi wasn’t sure.</p>
<p>“Here’s your apple, dude. Eat it all up,” Kaito ordered, handing him the fruit.</p>
<p>“Eat it all? Don’t apple seeds contain trace amounts of poison?” Shuichi asked inquisitively, rubbing the apple on his shirt.</p>
<p>“Wait, really?” Kaito said through a mouthful of toast. “Shit, dude, I’ve been eating apple seeds my whole life!”</p>
<p>“How are you still alive?” Shuichi asked, taking a small bite of his apple. Kaito shrugged and continued to eat his toast as Shuichi gingerly ate his own breakfast.</p>
<p><i>Ugh</i>. Shuichi didn’t often eat in the morning because it made him feel queasy in the moment, even if he usually did feel better after. Nonetheless he finished most of it, at Kaito’s orders, and sat down beside him.</p>
<p>“So, what do you want to play first?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Whatever. I could go for some Smash,” Kaito replied as he started on his banana.</p>
<p>“Ugh,” Shuichi sighed as he navigated the menu and clicked on the game’s icon- luckily it was the game they had played last, and was still in the system. “I’m bad at Smash.”</p>
<p>Kaito grinned. “I’m not!”</p>
<p>They started up a game and chose their main fighters. Kaito picked their first stage- Final Destination because of course he would pick that.</p>
<p>They were in a stock match, so the game lasted a while, but eventually Kaito came out on top with Shuichi trailing behind in second. </p>
<p>“How are you so good at this?” Shuichi asked, frustrated. Kaito leaned back slightly and shot him a grin. </p>
<p>“Welcome to my domain,” he said, sweeping his arms outwards.</p>
<p>They played some more matches for a few hours. While Shuichi managed to usurp Kaito’s position in first place a couple times, he more often than not found himself tumbling into second or third place. He sighed deeply, throwing down his controller on the ground.</p>
<p>“I’m done. I’m one hundred percent done,” he groaned, pressing the ball of the palm of his hand to his forehead. He rubbed his eyes, still seeing images of him falling into pit after pit or being launched into the sky flash under his eyelids.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know you were such a sore loser, Shuichi,” Kaito replied smugly, clearly feeling happy with himself. Shuichi collapsed to the floor on his back, staring daggers at Kaito with narrowed grey eyes.</p>
<p>“...” He sent Kaito all of the bad vibes he could telepathically. The boy recoiled slightly.</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.” Kaito joined Shuichi on the floor, stretching his arms above his head and yawning. They lied on the carpet for a while as video game music played softly in the background. Shuichi lay with his arm across his face when he heard a sharp, bright noise.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Kaito hummed, reaching around beside him. When he pulled back his arm, his phone was in his hand. He blinked at the screen. “A text from Maki Roll. She’ll be here in a minute,” he told Shuichi. The blue-haired boy pulled himself up into a sitting position.</p>
<p>“Cool,” he replied. As he stood, Kaito watched him from the carpet with a neutral expression, remaining still. Shuichi gestured towards him. “Are you gonna… Get up? Your girlfriend is almost here,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>“If she can’t handle me at my Ellen Degenerate, she doesn’t deserve me at my Ellen The Generous,” Kaito sighed and waved his hand through the air apathetically. Shuichi smiled slightly.</p>
<p>“I genuinely can’t understand most of what you say,” he said. Kaito grinned, and after a few moments of quiet between them, there was a rapping on the door. “Maki,” he said under his breath as he stepped over Kaito and opened the door.</p>
<p>“Hi, Maki,” Shuichi greeted. She was looking fresh, with a ponytail instead of her normal twintails, holding a cardboard tray with two cups stuck in it and two paper bags on top. She looked a bit flustered.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shuichi. Hey, Kaito,” she said. Kaito waved emphatically from the ground.</p>
<p>“Hiii Maki Roll!” he chirped cheerily. Maki glared at him with the slightest of smiles on her mouth, and threw one of the paper bags at his stomach. He jolted up, gripping his gut.</p>
<p>“Your reaction timing is terrible,” Maki said with a shake of her head. She handed the tray to Shuichi and started peeling off her coat. “On my way here from the gym, I decided to grab some food. So I brought you guys some, because I can’t imagine you’ve eaten much this morning.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s really nice of you, Maki,” Shuichi thanked, setting the tray on a table. Kaito had already opened his bag and was speaking through mouthfuls of donut.</p>
<p>“I have the bestest girlfriend!” he laughed. “Thanks a million Maki Roll!”</p>
<p>Maki sighed again, but gave Kaito an affectionate look. She adjusted the straps of her tank top before she spoke again. “So, why are you on the floor, perchance…?”</p>
<p>“Life is hard,” Kaito responded as he rolled onto his side.</p>
<p>“You just finished eating a donut and appear to have been previously engaged in playing video games,” Maki said. Kaito gripped his heart and slowly made his way to a sitting position.</p>
<p>“You’re so mean, Maki Roll,” he mumbled as Shuichi took one of the cups from the tray and slowly took a sip. <i>Hot chocolate</i>. Maki was a well-known babysitter- Shuichi guessed that it was her go-to drink to buy other people.</p>
<p>“As I am often told,” Maki responded and sat down beside Kaito. She turned and looked at Shuichi. “Sorry, Shuichi, Kaito texted and asked if Kaede was free as well, but she was going out with Kiibo and Rantaro.”</p>
<p>“Kaito!” Shuichi said accusingly, turning as hot as the drink in his hand. “I can’t believe you actually asked her!”</p>
<p>“Soz, Shuichi. Thought I’d ask just in case,” Kaito replied. Shuichi felt embarrassment well up in him, but also felt a slight hint of dissatisfaction. <i>I kinda wish she was free to come over… Uh, not like that!</i> He scratched the back of his head.</p>
<p>“Well, uh…” he mumbled, not forming a complete sentence, as usual. </p>
<p>“Speaking of Kaede, though,” Maki continued, “Her and I were discussing our Valentine’s plans with each other. I said that Kaito and I were probably just going to go get dinner or something, when she said that ‘I should invite Kaito and Shuichi’ over to our dorm.”</p>
<p>Shuichi felt a jolt of electricity tear through him. “Really?” Kaito asked. He exchanged a look with his roommate.</p>
<p>“Yeah. Apparently, she’s been planning a party of sorts. Her, Miu, and Tenko are all gonna have their dorms open since, well, they’re small, and she’s inviting about fifteen people,” Maki explained. Shuichi grabbed the bag she brought him and his drink and made his way over to his bed, sitting on the edge of the frame.</p>
<p>“Ooo, okay, a Valentine’s Party… I can dig that,” Kaito said. “Hell yeah, I can groove to that! So, since this is a party that’s happening on the day of love, I can assume that there’s gonna be some love-related events, right?”</p>
<p>Maki chuckled softly. “You better not put any ideas in Kaede’s head. She’s already insisting on decorating our dorm with heart decor and the like,” she told the two boys. Shuichi took another sip of his hot chocolate.</p>
<p>“Um, yeah, I’ll be there,” he said awkwardly. “If there’s too many people going, though, I can hang back,” he added, kind of quietly.</p>
<p>With a dramatic rolling of the eyes, Maki spoke. “Kaede specifically told me to make sure you two will be there.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that right…?” Shuichi asked.</p>
<p>“Damn, Shuichi, just accept the invitation!” Kaito said eagerly. Shuichi touched the side of his face and self-consciously brushed back a lock of dark hair.</p>
<p>“Alright… I’d be happy to go,” he said. Kaito clapped his hands together and brightened.</p>
<p>“Fantastic! And I’ll be there too, of course, because Shuichi would be a blushing pile of nerves without me by his side,” Kaito said happily. Shuichi cringed.</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault that my entire body is a nervous system,” he defended himself. Kaito grinned at his dismay and Maki even had a slight look of satisfaction on her normally stone-like face. She pulled out her phone.</p>
<p>“Awesome. I’ll text her right away, because I’m sure she’s dying to know,” Maki stated without a trace of sarcasm. Shuichi held his cup up to his face to hide his reddened cheeks.</p>
<p>“Um?” he mumbled. Kaito cracked his knuckles as Maki tapped away on her phone.</p>
<p>“Alright! From this point onwards, on this day, we will not discuss Kaede or crushes or anything! I just want to have a chill day of relaxation with my two best friends,” Kaito declared. He wrapped an arm around Maki and extended the other to Shuichi.</p>
<p>“Fine by me, you’re the one who always teases me about Kaede anyways,” Shuichi replied. Kaito grabbed a controller that he had left on the ground.</p>
<p>“So, what do we start with? Smash?” he asked. Shuichi groaned.</p>
<p>“Never again,” he said simply. Maki picked up the boy’s discarded controller.</p>
<p>“I’ll smash you,” she offered. Then she cringed and screwed up her face upon realizing what she had just said. “Disregard that.”</p>
<p>“Impossible,” Kaito said. Shuichi reclined on his bed and watched Maki and Kaito play a few rounds. Even though they were radically different, the love and affection between them was just as noticeable as their shared stubborn and headstrong behaviours. He felt a surge of jealousy that he tried his best to push down.</p>
<p>“So, Shuichi, did you know that I’ve never lost to Maki Roll in this game? She’s the only one who manages to best me every single time,” Kaito said with a peeved expression, furiously pressing buttons on his controller- as opposed to Maki, who was composed and, frankly, kicking Kaito’s ass with ease.</p>
<p>“Uh, haven’t you played Shinguuji-kun a couple times? And he’s managed to win every time?” Shuichi pointed out. Maki gave an uncharacteristic snort as she punted Kaito’s character off the screen.</p>
<p>“Shinguuji? Really?” she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>“Shinguuji is a dirty cheater that bores you to death with anthropology speeches and then final smashes you into oblivion,” Kaito tried desperately to defend his honour. “I refuse to acknowledge those matches as fair.”</p>
<p>“Huh.” With a well-timed blow, Kaito’s character is dealt fifty percent damage. “Sounds like someone can’t handle the truth,” Maki teased.</p>
<p>“You’re s’possed to be on my side, Maki Roll!” Kaito feigned offense. “Ugh, how are you so good at this anyways?”</p>
<p>“I played basketball and rugby all through high school. I’m a black belt in karate. I’m working on mastering various forms of martial arts like aikido and taekwondo,” Maki started. “I could crush this game with my finger tips. This game… is far too simple.”</p>
<p>“Maki, it’s a video game,” Shuichi pointed out. Maki silenced him with an icy glare.</p>
<p>“This game is for mere mortals, when I have ascended into a higher plane of martial arts,” she said as Kaito’s character flew out of the shot.</p>
<p>“You coulda just said you go to the gym everyday and know how to beat up small fictional animals and furries,” Kaito said as the T.V shifted into the results screen.</p>
<p>“...That too,” Maki said as she placed the controller on the floor in front of her. “I’m bored of this game. Can we play something else or watch T.V?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Kaito relented as Shuichi slithered off of his bed.</p>
<p>“Let’s play Mario Kart,” he suggested as he fell onto the floor.</p>
<p>“You’re on.”</p>
<p>“Do you want to die?”</p>

  <b>February 12th - Two Days Until Valentine's Day</b>
</p>
<p>Shuichi was never the most athletically inclined, so to speak. The only sport he played in high school was badminton, and even back in elementary, he seldom participated in track and field. He thought that he remembered playing on the volleyball team, but the memory was fuzzy, so he was unsure.</p>
<p>So leave it to his two very active best friends to drag him to the gym at least once a week so he doesn’t rot away.</p>
<p>“What are we doing today?” Shuichi asked as Kaito pulled him out of Maki’s car. He stumbled onto the hard concrete of the parking garage.</p>
<p>“The usual, some cardio and some weight-lifting,” Kaito replied as he adjusted the collar of his jacket. Shuichi looked at him. Waist down, his roommate was only wearing gym shorts, despite the cold temperature. Shuichi had opted to change at the gym himself.</p>
<p>Maki clicked her car locker and stepped around the side of the vehicle, dressed a little more appropriately than her boyfriend in a pair of black tights. “I mean, you two can do that, but I’m going to do something a little more hardcore.”</p>
<p>The three trudged through the parking garage and to the entrance to the mall where the gym was housed. “Well, we’ll do what you’re doing,” Kaito offered. <i>Speak for yourself!</i> Shuichi thought indignantly. Maki’s eyebrows knit, looking the slightest bit amused.</p>
<p>“You? At best, you’ll pass out. I don’t even want to imagine what would happen to Shuichi,” she reprimanded. Shuichi frowned.</p>
<p>“Your words wound me,” he replied simply. Maki flashed him a look of disbelief.</p>
<p>“Do you want to try my workout?” she asked. Shuichi stuck out his outer lip.</p>
<p>“Not particularly, no,” he admitted. Maki smiled.</p>
<p>“Exactly,” she said matter-of-factly as she turned her gaze forward and pushed open the mall’s door. “Now, Kaito, you’re welcome to try, but you’ll have to suffer the consequences of a hundred consecutive push-ups and forty minutes of the treadmill on its highest incline.” </p>
<p>“On second thought,” Kaito mumbled as they stepped into the mall and began to defrost. “Maybe not.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stick to my elliptical, thanks,” Shuichi added as the trio walked across the ceramic tiles of the mall’s floor, towards the escalator leading down to the gym. </p>
<p>“Wise decision.” Maki stepped gingerly onto the descending stairwell and the three rode down in a comfortable silence.</p>
<p>They made small talk with the attendant at the front desk as they scanned their passes and walked through the gym’s gate, each of them grabbing a towel. </p>
<p>Maki shrugged off her jacket. “Let’s meet back here in about an hour, alright?” Tucking her jacket between her knee to free her hands, she quickly pulled her hair up into a ponytail.</p>
<p>“Alright,” Kaito responded, removing his own coat. Shuichi followed suit.</p>
<p>“Okay, sure,” the blue-haired boy agreed. Maki curtly nodded and the three started towards the change rooms.</p>
<p>“I hate the winter,” Maki commented off-handedly, hugging her jacket to her chest. “You have to wear so many layers and it just makes everything so uncomfortable.” </p>
<p>“But you also get snow, and snow is so pretty!” Kaito objected. “No two snowflakes are the same, and I think that’s beautiful. No one knows why either! Just another mystery of the universe!”</p>
<p>“Actually,” Maki said as she placed her hand on the door to the women’s change room, “it’s due to fluctuating temperature and humidity differences constantly changing in the atmosphere.”</p>
<p>“When you apply science, it takes away the magic, Maki Roll,” Kaito pouted.</p>
<p>Maki stuck out her tongue slightly in jest. “Aren’t <i>you</i> supposed to be a scientist?” she asked. Shuichi was about to pull open the door to their own change room when suddenly the women’s door burst open and-</p>
<p>“Oh! Hi guys!”</p>
<p>It was comical, really, how often Shuichi found himself running into <i>her</i>. Like they were characters in a romantic comedy or TV show. What a string of coincidences, right? It’s not like, for instance, she messaged Maki that morning and asked if she was bringing Kaito and Shuichi to work out with her, no...</p>
<p>Kaede was looking pretty as always, with a high ponytail, an aggressively bright pink tank top, and a pair of spandex shorts. “Fancy meeting you here! What a coinkydink!”</p>
<p>“Ah-ha, yeah,” Shuichi muttered awkwardly, still waiting for the shock of seeing her to fade away and settle in the pit of his stomach.</p>
<p>“Hey, Kaede,” Maki greeted with a dip of her head.</p>
<p>“What’s hanging, A-slice?” Kaito said casually. Shuichi gave him a weird look.</p>
<p>“Nothing much, M-dog,” Kaede responded cheerfully, tipping her water bottle back and forth. Kaito grinned. “So what brings you here?”</p>
<p>“Exercise?” Maki answered. Kaede’s eyes widened slightly, then she laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, of course,” she chuckled. “It’s just, I never see Shuichi here. I thought maybe today was, er, special?”</p>
<p>Singled out, Shuichi swallowed nervously. “Ah, I just don’t work out as much as Kaito or Maki.” He gripped his arm subconsciously. </p>
<p>“I totally get that. I wake up and I’m like, ugh, I’d rather die than get out of my nice warm bed and go to the gym,” Kaede rambled. Shuichi struggled took look her in the eyes and tried not to look at any part of her body below the chin. </p>
<p>“Ah, yeah… Kaito always drags me along so that I don’t waste away in our dorm,” Shuichi explained. Kaede beamed and leaned in closer to Shuichi.</p>
<p>“Maki always tries to get me to go more, but I like lying in bed all day. I feel you, Shuichi.” Kaede put her hand to her heart.</p>
<p><i>I wish that were literal- Wait, what the hell am I saying?</i> Shuichi felt himself begin to redden at his own thoughts. “A-ah, totally, Kaede.” He found himself dumbly staring into the girl’s eyes. Kaede smiled warmly at him. His heart sped up like he was already running on the treadmill. </p>
<p>“Well, if you guys can stop flirting for five seconds, we can get Shuichi into his gym clothes,” Kaito chuckled. </p>
<p>“Huh? I wasn’t flirting!” Shuichi objected as Kaito pushed open the change room door and pulled him inside by his collar.</p>
<p>“Bye, Kaede! Let’s work out together!” Kaito chirped and waved goodbye. Shuichi put up his own hand in a kind of stiff wave of his own.</p>
<p>“Okay!” Kaede responded. Maki rolled her eyes, and that was the last thing Shuichi saw before the change room door banged shut. He whipped around to face Kaito and saw the purple-haired boy grinning widely.</p>
<p>“This is great! You can spend more time with Kaede!” he said, clapping his hands together happily. Shuichi’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>“What do you mean? Did you plan this?” he asked in an accusing tone. Kaito held up his hands in defense.</p>
<p>“No way, jose. I had no part in this,” he insisted. Shuichi’s lips flattened.</p>
<p>“Alright, but I don’t want her to see me work out! I’m… I don’t really like the way my body looks,” Shuichi said, flushing with shame. Kaito stepped towards him and grabbed him firmly by the shoulders.</p>
<p>“Shuichi. You look fine. You’re perfect just the way you are!” He shook him gently. “Stop putting Kaede up on a pedestal much higher than you. She’s just a girl, and if she can’t like you for you, than she’s not worth it. You have to talk to her and be yourself,” he said sternly, looking straight into Shuichi’s eyes. The boy averted his gaze.</p>
<p>“A-alright, Kaito,” he conceded. Kaito slapped him on the back.</p>
<p>“Sick,” he said. “Now let’s get you changed.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Shuichi nervously stepped out of the change room, dressed in a plain grey tank and black shorts. Kaito nudged him out eagerly. “You ready to get your sweat on?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Can’t wait,” Shuichi mumbled back. He looked up and saw Kaede using a biceps curler machine. She noticed the two boys and gently returned the machine to its original position, then waved them over. As they approached, Shuichi found himself covering his body with his arms self-consciously.</p>
<p>Kaito gently took his shoulder and moved his arms away from his chest. “Heya, Kaede,” he greeted. She smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“Hey, you two!” she responded. “What do you want to start with?” she asked, immediately getting down to business. Shuichi looked past her in an attempt not to ogle her too much.</p>
<p>“How about some running?” Kaito offered. “Since, you know, you were just doing some weight lifting while we were changing.” The boy grabbed the edges of his galaxy print shirt and pulled it down over his shorts.</p>
<p>“Okay.” Kaede suddenly turned to face Shuichi. “What do you think, Shuichi?”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Shuichi stuttered. “Oh, whatever you and Kaito decide to do is fine!”</p>
<p>“Jeez, Shuichi, you should be more assertive,” Kaede said dismissively, putting her finger tips to her lips. “Do you want to go on the treadmills or not?” She shifted her posture and placed her hands on her hips.</p>
<p>“Ah…” Shuichi felt a surge of shock. Why would she say something like that? “Er, yeah. I like to start my workouts with some running.”</p>
<p>“Alrighty,” Kaede chirped. “Let’s go boys!” She reached up and wrapped her arms around the necks of the two boys, pulling them forward. Shuichi let out a yelp of surprise, feeling the girl’s skin touch his own.</p>
<p>The three headed towards the rows of treadmills, Kaede in the lead. Shuichi blushed slightly and Kaito smirked knowingly, side-eyeing him. </p>
<p>Kaede pulled out her phone from her shorts, white earbuds clacking against the case. “Do you guys listen to music while you workout?” she asked, fingering the white cords. Kaito nodded and took out his own phone.</p>
<p>“Er, me too.” Shuichi fumbled and took his phone from his pocket. Kaede chuckled softly and put her earbuds into her ears.</p>
<p>“It almost ruins the idea of working out together if we’re all just listening to music, but I think what’s important is the spirit of it,” she hummed. “Just being together with your friends can boost your mood, and exercise makes you feel good, too!”</p>
<p><i>Ah… Friends.</i> A rush was sent through Shuichi at being referred to as such. He had felt uneasy, constantly feeling like he was a burden to Kaede, so hearing her call him her ‘friend’ was a bit of a relief. He put in his own earbuds and smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Hell yeah, Kaede! I get your vibe,” Kaito said. He placed his headphones over his head, then pulled one slightly off his ear to hear better. “How long do you usually run for?” he asked, resting a hand on one of the handlebars of the machine.</p>
<p>“Uhm… Let’s go for fifteen minutes!” she said after a moment’s pause. Kaito gave her a thumbs up and Shuichi nodded his agreement.</p>
<p>And so, they started.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There’s not much you can talk about when you’re working out, since all three of them were listening to music. Shuichi tried his best to keep his gaze locked straight ahead, staring at the muted TVs mounted on the wall instead of at Kaede.</p>
<p>“Tried” being the key word.</p>
<p>Hey, he’s exercising beside the girl he likes. Cut the boy some slack.</p>
<p>There were a million things that came into his mind that he wanted to share with her as they moved from running to using the ellipticals to muscle-building machines. But every time he turned to her to say something and saw her reddened, focused face, his mouth dried up and he couldn’t bring himself to speak.</p>
<p>It felt like a missed opportunity, really. Each time the words came into his mouth, they were cut down by his own incompetence and inability to talk to other people like a normal human. He clenched his teeth, constantly wanting more from her but not having the courage to go for it.</p>
<p>“Augh!” Shuichi suddenly shouted as he was drying off a biceps strengthener machine. His eyes were focused on the clock hanging on the wall. “It’s almost time to go and meet up with Maki!” he said worriedly. Kaito cast a glance at the time.</p>
<p>“Ah shit, you’re right.” He ran a hand through his hair. “Kaede, we gotta blast.”</p>
<p>Kaede blinked. “That’s alright!” She approached the two of them with a smile. “It was really fun working out with you two. I usually do it alone, but it’s nice to have you guys with me.” Her eyes went from Shuichi to Kaito and back to Shuichi again.</p>
<p>“We should do this again,” she said finally, wiping her forehead.</p>
<p>“I’m down,” Kaito said.</p>
<p>“Me too,” Shuichi said. Kaede grinned.</p>
<p>“Well then, I guess- Wait.” She started her farewell, then broke off mid-sentence. “You two are coming to the Valentine’s get together, right?”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah!” Kaito said. </p>
<p>“We’ll be there,” Shuichi promised. Kaede clapped her hands together. </p>
<p>“Awesome!” she chirped. “Well, I’m going to do some stretches and then I’ll be on my way as well.” She waved at the two boys and took a step away. “Bye guys!”</p>
<p>“Bye, Kaede,” Shuichi said. Kaito also gave a cheery goodbye.</p>
<p>As she headed off towards the yoga mats, Shuichi pulled his phone out of his pocket. They had about ten minutes until the agreed meeting time, and in addition to the time, he saw whole bunch of messages on his lock screen. With a sigh, he opened them.</p>
<p>[9:25 A.M] Kokichi: henlo saihara-chan<br/>[9:28 A.M] Kokichi: saihara-chan where art thou<br/>[9:30 A.M] Kokichi: SAIHARA-CHANNNNNNN<br/>[9:35 A.M] Kokichi: huh you’re not in ur dorm<br/>[9:36 A.M] Kokichi: where are you my beloved saihara-chan are u dead</p>
<p>Shuichi frowned. Of course.</p>
<p>[9:45 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: sorry ouma-kun i was at the gym<br/>[9:45 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: ...i’m still at the gym<br/>[9:46 A.M] Kokichi: so you finally reply<br/>[9:46 A.M] Kokichi: men are so unreliable</p>
<p>As they made their way back to the change room with Kaito yammering on and on, Shuichi continued to text the quintuple-texting gremlin known as Kokichi.</p>
<p>[9:46 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: wait you went to my dorm?<br/>[9:46 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: nvm. what do you want from me?<br/>[9:47 A.M] Kokichi: you’re automatically assuming that i want something from you? can’t i just text my friend w/o being treated as a burden?<br/>[9:47 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: ....i’ll ask again, what do you want from me?<br/>[9:47 A.M] Kokichi: RUDE. IM HURT<br/>[9:48 A.M] Kokichi: but it’s w/e i’m used to being mistreated and abused<br/>[9:48 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: are you alright? like do you need help? i can recommend you to my therapist<br/>[9:48 A.M] Kokichi: the only person’s help i need is yours saihara-chan<br/>[9:48 A.M] Kokichi: wanna go shopping with me and kii-boy?<br/>[9:49 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: why?<br/>[9:49 A.M] Kokichi: does there need to be a why??? don’t you want to spend time with me without there being an ulterior motive?????<br/>[9:49 A.M] Kokichi: anyways akamatsu-chan requested my expertise to buy some supplies for her party and i could use some assistance <br/>[9:50 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: why me?<br/>[9:50 A.M] Kokichi: cuz ur cool and i like you. you in?<br/>[9:50 A.M] Shuichi Saihara: i guess…<br/>[9:50 A.M] Kokichi: rad we’ll pick you up at 11</p>
<p>Shuichi looked up from his phone and gave a grand sigh. Kaito gazed over at him, concerned.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, dude?” he asked. Shuichi gave him a tired look.</p>
<p>“I think I just sold my soul to the devil.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“Get in loser, we’re going red solo cup shopping.”</p>
<p>Despite the weather and overcast sky, Kokichi was still wearing sunglasses which he slid down the bridge of his nose upon greeting Shuichi. Kiibo leaned back in his seat.</p>
<p>“I’d just like to apologize in advance for whatever this is.” With his hand that wasn’t on the steering wheel, Kiibo gestured to Kokichi. The boy pouted and crossed his arms over his puffy, bright purple coat. Seriously, where do you even buy something like that?</p>
<p>“Rude, Kii-boy,” he mumbled dejectedly. Shuichi gingerly opened the back door of the car and stepped in, settling into the black seats. Once he strapped himself in, Kiibo started driving. Music from a random radio station filled the vehicle.</p>
<p>“So, why did Kaede have you buy supplies instead of, I don’t know, Maki? Shuichi asked as the car pulled off onto the main roads.</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s finally realized that I have superior interior design sense, and is giving me the errands I deserve,” Kokichi speculated, re-adjusting his sunglasses.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but why someone like <i>you</i>?” Shuichi continued.</p>
<p>“Shuichi, are you implying that people can’t trust me?” Kokichi said, turning around in his chair and looking at Shuichi through the gap between the front seats.</p>
<p>“Not particularly, no,” Kiibo said absently.</p>
<p>“What the hell? This is slander of my personal character!” Kokichi sounded outraged, though, knowing him, it was probably hyperbolic in nature. “I can and will sue you for this.”</p>
<p>“Try me, bitch.” Kiibo narrowed his eyes. Shuichi felt a pang of sympathy for the white-haired boy. He knew he didn’t swear often, but being around Kokichi for so long would definitely have that effect on a person. Besides, with someone as… Uncensored as Kokichi, that’ll rub off on you.</p>
<p>Having him as a roommate and close friend must be tiring.</p>
<p>“Oh, Kii-boy, you’re a laugh riot,” Kokichi said, relaxing into his seat. </p>
<p>Kiibo shook his head slightly, hiding a soft smile that crossed his lips. “So, how was your morning, Shuichi?” he asked, changing the topic.</p>
<p>“It was pretty good. I was at the gym with Kaito, Maki, and Kaede,” Shuichi said.</p>
<p>“Which is why you weren’t replying to my messages,” Kokichi muttered.</p>
<p>“How was yours and Kokichi’s?” Shuichi asked, ignoring Kokichi (which is really the smartest option in most conversations).</p>
<p>“It was nice, even though Kokichi tends to sleep in and get mad when I wake him up showering,” Kiibo said, turning the steering wheel.</p>
<p>“Sleeping in is what weekends were made for!” Kokichi interjected. “I’d sleep until one pee-em if Kii-boy would let me. Hell, the only thing I’d do is sleep if humans needed no sustenance and also I didn’t have class.”</p>
<p>“And yet you’re the one who always wants us to have breakfast together,” Kiibo sighed. Kokichi pouted.</p>
<p>“It’s a bonding exercise, Kii-boy!” he explained, and reached his hand towards Kiibo. </p>
<p>“Please don’t try and hold my hand while I’m driving, unless you want to crash and die,” Kiibo said sternly. Kokichi shrugged and picked at his jacket.</p>
<p>“I’d be down,” he said airily. “Let’s burn this boy.”</p>
<p>“Sure, if you’ll pay for damages,” Kiibo offered sarcastically.</p>
<p>Kokichi put a finger to his chin in thought as Kiibo pulled into the parking lot of a plaza. Luckily, their university was in a fairly urban area, and you didn’t have to drive far to get to stores or restaurants. “On second thought, this boy is broke as heck. Funerals are expensive, y’know? I can’t even afford to die.”</p>
<p>“How… Unfortunate?” Shuichi said quizzically.</p>
<p>“Though, that could be a lie. I could be a millionaire, with an underground vault filled with money. Maybe I own our entire university, and things run according to my will,” Kokichi said flatly, his mouth completely flat. “You’ll never know.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure that’s untrue, like many other things you say,” Kiibo put in doubtfully as he pulled into a parking spot.</p>
<p>“Uhm, proof please?” Kokichi said in an annoying, high pitched voice. “You can’t reject my claims on baseless conjecture, Kii-boy!”</p>
<p>“The base for my conjecture is,” Kiibo started as he got out of the car, Shuichi and Kokichi following suit, “that half of the things you say are lies, and I’m extrapolating to deduce that that holds true this time, as well.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Kii-boy! You know me sooo well! I’m impressed!” Kokichi exclaimed, blowing a breath into the air and watching it transform into white mist. He zipped up his jacket and put his hands on his hips. “And that’s why we’re best friends,” he mused.</p>
<p>Then he pointed a finger towards a large department store and angled his body towards it. “And now, the adventure for party supplies begins!” He grinned and then started running across the snowy parking lot, with a complete disregard for the cars milling around. “Wa-hoo!” he bellowed.</p>
<p>Shuichi chuckled, staring after him. “Never a dull moment with Kokichi, is there?” he asked Kiibo as they began to walk towards the store at a normal pace. Kiibo shook his head.</p>
<p>“I’d say the only time he’s calm is when he’s sleeping, but he has restless leg syndrome,” he sighed, hands in his pockets. “When he’s sick, even, he’s lethargic, but still clingy and happy.”</p>
<p>“You know a lot about Kokichi, don’t you?” Shuichi asked. Kiibo looked down at the ground, as if embarrassed. </p>
<p>“Not really of my own volition, but I guess I do,” he decided. Shuichi looked around the lot. It was snowing very softly, tiny flakes falling all around them.</p>
<p>“Doesn’t he annoy you, though? Why are you two always hanging out with each other?” Shuichi asked curiously. Kiibo glanced up and tipped his head to the side, appearing to be struggling with coming up with an answer to Shuichi’s inquiry.</p>
<p>“I mean, that’s just the way Kokichi is.” He glanced across the lot, where Kokichi was standing at the entrance, glaring at the two of them. “Despite our misgivings, I enjoy his company and he is one of my closest friends. I don’t know what university life would be like without him. He always jokes and lies, but you can tell that deep down, he cares about his friends.” A smile quirked his lips. “I think.”</p>
<p>“You care a lot about Kokichi, huh, Kiibo?” Shuichi said with a grin. “It’s kind of adorable.”</p>
<p>“A-adorable? Shuichi, I must criticize your choice of words!” Kiibo exclaimed, flushed. “I’ve just been stuck with him as a roommate for so long!”</p>
<p>“Alright, Kiibo, whatever you say,” Shuichi murmured. Kiibo frowned.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if I like what you’re insinuating,” he muttered in response. Shuichi shrugged his shoulders casually as they came upon Kokichi, who was standing with his arms crossed over his chest, assuming a hunched over position.</p>
<p>“So, you two <i>finally</i> catch up. Jeez, y’all are slow,” he complained, taking a step towards them. He reaches out towards the pair and eagerly grabbed their hands from their pockets. Kiibo stiffened and Shuichi’s eyebrows knit. “Let’s go get some mediocre party decor!”</p>
<p>He took the two by their hands and led them into the store, skipping cheerily. Kiibo rolled his eyes and Shuichi smiled awkwardly. “So, what’s first on the agenda?” Shuichi wondered aloud. Kokichi paused in the front of the store and looked around.</p>
<p>“Well, Shuichi, I am so glad you asked, because let me tell you, I have no idea,” Kokichi chirped. “Kaede told me that I don’t have to buy any food, because she’s going to take care of that herself.”</p>
<p>“They probably have some cheesy hearts on strings or things like that,” Shuichi pointed out, looking at the bright pink and red displays. “And you can get some things like styrofoam cups and paper plates,” he added.</p>
<p>Kokichi nodded his head slightly. “I don’t know why Kaede wanted decorations so bad. We’re buying into the commercial aspect of holidays and becoming but mindless consumers in the eyes of money-hungry companies, instead of celebrating the true meaning of Valentine’s- if you try and officiate weddings illegally, you’ll be brutally executed by an asshole emperor.” He exhaled a breathy sigh. “Valentine’s Day is so lovely.”</p>
<p>“I worry about what goes on in your head,” Kiibo mumbled. Shuichi gave a murmur of agreement.</p>
<p>“Whatevs,” Kokichi said. He dropped Shuichi and Kiibo’s hands and rushed over to the display, examining the decorations with great interest. The two other boys followed him, Shuichi unbuttoning his jacket as he wandered over.</p>
<p>“I’m having a vision,” Kokichi said cheerfully to the other two, pinching a string of hearts with his fingers. “These strung up on the wall, with these…” He reached over to the shelf and grabbed a fistful of heart-pattern doilies. “On each surface. And, don’t forget-” he took a step backwards and slapped a hand down on a package of pink, Valentine’s themed paper plates next to a pack of cups with the same design. “These. For eating and drinking, respectively.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good,” Shuichi said with a nod. Kiibo offered his own agreement.</p>
<p>Kokichi snapped his fingers suddenly. “Maybe we should get some rose petals to spread on the beds. You know, for atmosphere,” he said with a grin.</p>
<p>“How about no thank you?” Kiibo said. Kokichi pursed his lips and started gathering his items of choice into his tiny arms.</p>
<p>“You’re no fun, Kii-boy. You know, it could be nice to have a rose-petal filled retreat during a Valentine’s Day party, you feel me? Yeah, you feel me. Shuichi feels me, right?” Kokichi pouted, visibly struggling with the decorations.</p>
<p>“I’d rather not feel you, but thanks for the offer,” Shuichi replied. Kiibo ran a hand through his puffy white hair.</p>
<p>“Anyways,” he said, looking a little flushed. “Do you need help with carrying all of that, Kokichi?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine,” Kokichi grunted. He walked forward a couple steps, before the stacks of dishes slid out of his grasp and fell to the floor. “I lied. I’m not fine.”</p>
<p>Kiibo leaned down and picked up the dropped items. “I’ll hold onto these.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably a good idea,” Shuichi said, amused. Kokichi snorted.</p>
<p>“It’s because of these baby arms. I’m trapped in this fun-size mortal body,” he mumbled.</p>
<p>“Some of the things you say are… Concerning, to say the least,” Kiibo responded, sounding slightly distressed. Kokichi quirked his lip, bemused.</p>
<p>“Aight,” he said as they walked over to the cashier. “Hey, Shuichi, grab that box of chocolates, thanks and please you.” He jutted out his chin at another display beside the checkout counter, where themed candies lined the shelves.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that’s how the phrase goes, and I thought Kaede didn’t want you to get snacks,” Shuichi said, grabbing the box anyways. Kokichi tilted his head.</p>
<p>“Not everything is about Kaede! These are for me! And Kii-boy if it so strikes his fancy,” Kokichi added, nudging his roommate playfully. Kiibo shifted the decorations in his arms.</p>
<p>With some effort, Kokichi stood on his tiptoes and placed the items on the desk. Kiibo unloaded his arms as well, and Shuichi placed the chocolates  beside their decorations. Kokichi smiled pleasantly as he took his wallet out of his pocket.</p>
<p>“Valentine’s Day party, I’m guessing?” the cashier asked as she rang up their items. She was a kind-looking woman with bright orange hair pulled back in a ponytail.</p>
<p>“You betcha,” Kokichi replied, fingers gripping the edge of the desk.</p>
<p>“Nice,” the woman commented, putting the decorations into a bag. “Make sure that you take care, though. Don’t party too hand. Valentine’s is on a school day, after all.” She held out the plastic bag, and Shuichi took it from her. “That’ll be seven dollars and fifty cents.”</p>
<p>Kokichi handed her a ten dollar bill. “Your change is two dollars and fifty cents,” she said as she took it, exchanging it for the change.</p>
<p>“Thankies,” Kokichi said, taking the money and shoving it into his wallet.</p>
<p>“Thank you, ma’am,” Shuichi said respectfully.</p>
<p>“Have a good day, you three!” The woman waved cheerily. Shuichi returned the gesture with his free hand, then gave the plastic bag he was holding to Kokichi.</p>
<p>“So, I’m assuming you’ll be at this party, too?” Shuichi asked, wondering why he didn’t inquire as soon as they picked him up.</p>
<p>“Yep, and it’s gonna be hella lit,” Kokichi replied, crinkling the bag as they left the store. “Hella lit, I tell you.”</p>
<p>“I heard you the first time.”</p>
<p>“Nishishishi~!”</p>

  <b>February 13th - One Day Until Valentine's Day</b>
</p>
<p>Frankly, Shuichi was unsure how he ended up in this situation. This was supposed to be a study group, created so that they could go over notes from their class and discuss the day’s topics. It wasn’t supposed to be… Whatever this was.</p>
<p>“For my last trick, I will need an assistant.”</p>
<p>“Me! Me! Ohhhh, pick me!” Shuichi watched Tenko, amused, as the girl’s hand shot into the air. She waved her arm fervently. Himiko’s eyes scanned the crowd of students- Tenko, Tsumugi, Kaede, Angie, Kiibo, and Shuichi himself. She thought for a moment, then pointed at Tenko.</p>
<p>“The magical aura is surrounding you,” Himiko said. Tenko excitedly hopped out of her seat and bounced over to the short redhead’s side. Shuichi found himself chuckling a bit at how different the two girls looked- not just their physical statures, but the way they dressed was wildly different. Tenko was wearing a pair of tights and a green crop top, while Himiko was wearing jeans, a denim jacket, and a red shirt.</p>
<p>“For this trick, I need Tenko’s testimony.” Despite her casual attire, Himiko was still wearing a hat that looked like a cross between a witch’s hat and a top hat. She gingerly took it from her head and held it out to Tenko. “There’s nothing in this hat, correct?”</p>
<p>Tenko leaned over and peered into the hat, blinking. “There’s nothing in the hat,” she affirmed, swinging her hands back and forth. Himiko beamed, withdrawing the hat. She tipped it slightly towards the rest of the study group before putting it back on her head.</p>
<p>“As you’ve heard, there is nothing in this. It’s just a regular mage’s cap.” Himiko twisted the brim of her hat around slightly and then tapped on the top. “Or so you think,” she muttered darkly with a smile. Tenko balked.</p>
<p>“Or so we think,” she whispered to herself in awe. Himiko smiled at the group and started to remove her hat again.</p>
<p>“Now… Watch this!” She flipped her cap upside down quickly, and lo and behold, a flash of white streaked up from the depths of the hat.</p>
<p>“A… A bird?!” Shuichi exclaimed, reeling backwards in his chair, bunching his arms close to his chest. Kiibo pointed at the bird and yelled.</p>
<p>“That’s not normal!” he cried. Angie chuckled and folded her hands as the bird flew confusedly around her dorm room.</p>
<p>“What a lovely trick, Himiko! You have such otherworldly talent!” she laughed, sweeping her arms outwards. Tenko clenched her hands into fists.</p>
<p>“Wow, Himiko, you’re so cool!” she squealed happily. Himiko bowed as Shuichi exchanged a bewildered glance with Kaede, who simply smiled and shook her head.</p>
<p>“You can call me Himiko,” Himiko mumbled, half to Tenko. She put her fingers in her mouth an whistled. “Hey, come back, Starlight,” she said, in a slightly louder tone than normal. The bird, who had been looking for an open window, suddenly flew back down to Himiko.</p>
<p>“You have that thing well trained,” Tsumugi commented.</p>
<p>“Its name is Starlight? That’s so cute! But not as cute as you,” Tenko cooed as Himiko, with an outstretched finger, gently guided the bird back into her hat. She looked up at Tenko, who had a slightly reddened face.</p>
<p>“...Of course. No one is as cute as me,” Himiko said. Shuichi tapped his fingers on the table and prodded the inside of his cheek with his mouth, pulling his eyebrows together. Tenko and Himiko both sat down, and Shuichi found himself wondering how the two even became friends-</p>
<p>Friends? Weren’t they dating?</p>
<p>Well, whichever one, Shuichi always thought they were so different- Himiko was generally pretty lazy and Tenko was upbeat and emotional all the time. It was amusing how the two became so close with one another.</p>
<p>“So, um, are we gonna study or not?” Tsumugi ran her fingers along the edge of the table they were sitting at- Since they were in Angie’s dorm, the surfaces were defaced with paint and hardened clay, and despite Kirumi’s best efforts, the signs still lingered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, let’s get started!” Kaede said brightly. She placed her hands on her book, fingers spread out. “Can I see your notes, Shuichi?”</p>
<p>“Mine?” Kaede looked at him and nodded. “Uh, sure.” He fumbled with his binder and passed it unceremoniously over to Kaede, feeling a sudden wave of shyness and self-consciousness. What if she thought his handwriting was messy? What if she thought that he took too little notes? Or too many? What if-</p>
<p>Kaede scrawled something down in her notes and then slid the binder back over to Shuichi. “Thanks! I just wrote something down that you had and I didn’t, I hope you don’t mind,” she said, tipping her head to the side as if embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Not at all,” Shuichi said dumbly. After a few moments of awkward air, the rest of the students started exchanging notes and talking amongst themselves.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shuichi, what page were the discussion questions on, again?” Kiibo asked, holding his textbook in his hands. Shuichi grabbed his own.</p>
<p>“234, I believe,” he said, flipping open the book and leafing through the pages. He thumbed the page in question and ran his fingers over the smooth paper, greeted by an entire page of questions. He suppressed a groan at the mere sight and laid the textbook on the table in front of him, turning over a fresh page in his notebook.</p>
<p>“So many questions,” Himiko complained, peering across the table. Tenko gripped her shoulder reassuringly.</p>
<p>“It’s alright, Himiko! We can do them together and finish them twice as fast!” the girl said, words flowing from her mouth like water. Himiko adjusted her hat (that still had a bird in it…?) and smiled.</p>
<p>“...Alright,” she responded simply, and Tenko beamed.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, Shuichi,” Kaede started. Shuichi bit his lip and turned to the girl. “I, uhm, forgot my book in my dorm. Do you want to do the questions together?” She twiddled the pen she was holding in his fingers.</p>
<p>“Sure, if you want to,” Shuichi said, in a bit of a wimpy, quiet voice.</p>
<p>“I do,” Kaede replied firmly. Shuichi raised his eyebrows and pushed the open textbook so it was in the middle of him and Kaede. She scooted her chair to be right beside Shuichi’s, then hunched herself over the table and started writing a title on her piece of paper.</p>
<p>“Um, my apologies for asking, but…” Shuichi, ignoring the nerves that were flaring to life inside his stomach, side-eyed the speaking Kiibo. “Have you two always been this close?” The white-haired boy looked slightly perplexed.</p>
<p>“Uh, what do you mean?” Shuichi tapped the eraser end of his pencil on his paper.</p>
<p>“No, they haven’t. They just started hanging out recently,” Himiko said, putting a finger to her lips.</p>
<p>“Because I always see you two together nowadays,” Kiibo said, finishing his thought. Shuichi leaned back in his chair, feeling heat creep up the back of his neck.</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it,” Tsumugi started, pushing up her glasses. “The two of you are almost never separated these days.” She smirked as Shuichi put a hand to his face, as if trying to drive the blush away from his cheeks.</p>
<p>“We’ve just started getting closer is all,” Kaede said with a soft chuckle, twirling a strand of blonde hair around her index finger. </p>
<p>“You could call them a twosome! Or a pair!” Angie chipped in, her eyes wide. “Or maybe even a couple!”</p>
<p>“No, no, no!” Shuichi exclaimed, slamming his hands down onto his notes. “It’s not like that at all!” she tried desperately to make up any excuses to undercut the sincere discomfort he felt building inside of him.</p>
<p>“Yeah, what he said!” Kaede tugged on the hair she had wrapped around her finger.</p>
<p>“Normally, I’d like to agree with Kaede,” Tenko weighed in. “But you two have been spending so much time together lately that it’s kind of disgusting.” She pursed her lips and narrowed her eyes. Shuichi tugged at his shirt’s collar.</p>
<p>“Ah, you guys are all just misunderstanding…” he said, waving his hands in front of the study group. Despite the painful awkwardness he was feeling, he felt like he was deriving some sort of satisfaction from his feelings being brought to life, if that makes sense. Still, though, he felt droplets of sweat forming on his forehead.</p>
<p>“Yeah, Shuichi and I aren’t like that!” Kaede interjected. Tsumugi leaned across the table and propped her chin up on her hand, clearly enjoying the conversation.</p>
<p>“I dunno, you both look pretty embarrassed right now,” she hummed. Stars practically erupted from her eyes. “It’s quickly becoming my newest OTP,” she sighed dreamily.</p>
<p>“Perhaps Kaede has a bit of a c-r-u-s-h?” Angie spelled out the word painfully slowly. Shuichi pulled his shirt over his face. If there was ever a moment where he needed his hat to shield his face from the world, it would be then. He refused to meet Kaede’s eyes and instead stared at his chest.</p>
<p>“Look at his face!” Tenko cried. Then she paused and narrowed her eyes. “Shuichi, I swear to all that is good and holy, I even swear to Angie’s God, if you try anything that Kaede isn’t okay with I <i>will</i> rip off your balls.”</p>
<p>“That’s a little bit harsh, Tenko,” Himiko said, putting her hand on the girl’s in an attempt to calm her down. “I don’t think Shuichi would do something like that.”</p>
<p>“I would <i>never</i>!” Shuichi suddenly cried out. The table went silent. “I mean, Kaede is great and all, but…” His voice got quiet as he risked a glance at Kaede, who looked not too dissimilar from him, with red cheeks and wide eyes. <i>God, she looks cute like that.</i> Warmth filled the pit of his stomach. “Don’t you guys think you’re being a little… Um… Presumptuous?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Kaede added in, a bit too loudly. Suddenly, she wrapped her arm around Shuichi’s neck and pulled him in close. “Shuichi and I are best buds, so don’t go thinking anything else!” she chirped. Shuichi flushed, his cheek almost brushing Kaede’s.</p>
<p>Tsumugi sighed, examining her nails. “Boring. But whatever you say~!” she said in a sing-songy voice. Shuichi frowned. Kiibo, looking quilty, folded his hands over his binder.</p>
<p>“I apologize, I didn’t realize that my question would cause so much trouble for the two of you. I’m really sorry!” he pleaded. Kaede leaned over the desk and rested her hand on his.</p>
<p>“Bless your pure soul, Kiibo. It’s not your fault,” she said soothingly. She retracted her am and glared at the girls who were giggling around the table. “It is their fault,” she said in an accusing tone, giving each one of them a sour look.</p>
<p>“Atua gives you his blessing, Kaede and Shuichi,” Angie said wistfully, ignoring the glare she was getting from Kaede. Shuichi scratched the back of his head and smiled nervously.</p>
<p>With a great sigh, Kaede sat back in her seat. Shuichi leaned over to her, putting a hand to the side of his mouth like he was telling a secret. “I’m really sorry about that,” he whispered shyly.</p>
<p>“And now they’re exchanging sweet nothings,” Tsumugi murmured to Kiibo, just loud enough for the pair to hear. Kaede tossed her a hard stare before responding to Shuichi.</p>
<p>“It’s alright! They tease me about this all the time,” she assured the boy. He tucked a loose hair strand behind his ear.</p>
<p>“Ah, do they…?” he asked. Kaede’s eyes widened and she put her hands to her mouth.</p>
<p>“Did I just say that? I just said that,” she whispered to herself. Shuichi felt some form of excitement come to life in his gut, “Ahhh, just ignore that!” she stuttered, anxiously running her fingers through her bangs. Shuichi watched her fondly.</p>
<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“I think Kaede likes me.”</p>
<p>“And I think that Tenko is in love with Himiko”</p>
<p>Shuichi lifted his head from his pillow to look over at Kaito, who was flipping through the few channels they had on the T.V. “I mean, I don’t want to sound full of myself or anything, but, uh, I think there might be a chance.” He rolled over on his back and stared at the rungs that separated him from his roommate’s bed.</p>
<p>“Bro, I think there’s more than a chance.” Kaito scratched his chin. “You’re cute, and she’s clearly into you- why do you think she’s been inviting you to place after place?”</p>
<p>“To be a good friend?” Shuichi guessed. Kaito shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>“Because she’s into you, duh.” He rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s just nice,” Shuichi objected. He slid his eyes over to Kaito and saw that the boy was staring at him blankly, pressing the T.V remote into his leg. </p>
<p>“Why is it so hard for you to believe that she likes you?” he asked, sounding genuinely confused. Shuichi flipped over in his bed and faced the opposite direction of Kaito, staring at the wall with great interest.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he sighed, curling his legs up and grabbing them, assuming some sort of fetal position. “There’s not much to like, and I don’t want to get my hopes up, because it’s too good to be true. There’s no way a girl like her could like someone like me the way I like her.” He pressed his face into the bedsheets.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>Shuichi tensed as he felt a hand on his shoulder. He screwed up his neck and saw Kaito, who had abandoned the T.V, standing over him with a flat-lipped expression. Shuichi blinked as his roommate crouched down to his level.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what goes on in your head to make you think like that, but it hurts my heart when you say those things about yourself. There’s a lot to like about you.” He tightened his grip on Shuichi and jostled him around a bit. “You’re funny. You’re smart. You’ve got great hair. Anyone who can’t see than is an idiot, because you’re Shuichi fucking Shuichi.”</p>
<p>Shuichi smiled in spite of himself, nearly feeling tears pricking his eyes. “Thanks, Kaito.”</p>
<p>“No problem, bro, don’t you ever forget it,” Kaito said with a grin.  “Let your worry melt away.” He took a couple steps backwards before he spoke again, and Shuichi rolled around to face him.</p>
<p>“And besides, even if Kaede doesn’t like you- and I’ve got a mad hunch that she does -I’ll still love you. You’ll still have me!” Kaito punched his chest and gave Shuichi a flashy smile. The blue-haired boy put a hand to his heart.</p>
<p>“Bro,” he whispered meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Bro.” Kaito’s response was equally as meaningful. Shuichi smiled. What did he ever do to deserve a friend like Kaito? Someone who stuck by him in thick and thin, who told him what he needed to hear, who was there every step of the way.</p>
<p>Surely, he was sent by the Gods themselves.</p>
<p><i>Ah, what am I thinking…?</i> Shuichi relaxed his limbs and stretched out across his bed. He watched Kaito return to his chair and start flipping through the channels again.</p>
<p>He watched the T.V screen from his bed through tired eyes. Be more assertive. Kaede’s words echoed in his head as did her laugh, smile, and most things about her. She was trying to get him to be more confident, too, huh… Warmth filled his entire body as he entertained the thought of her liking him, a fuzzy, almost numbing feeling taking over him.</p>
<p>“Kaito,” he said finally, as Kaito was watching an episode of the cult classic <i>How It’s Made.</i> The boy blinked and looked at him.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been to a party in a long time,” he began, shifting so that his upper body was near the edge of his bed and his arms were draping off the side. “What exactly should I… You know… Do?”</p>
<p>Kaito stared at him for a few moments, then threw his head back in hearty laughter. He pushed his hand to his forehead as Shuichi frowned.</p>
<p>“It’s a serious question!” he defended himself. In spite of himself, he found his own giggling making its way into his words. Kaito’s laughter was infectious. The laughter slowly trickled away and Kaito wiped at his eyes, his smile wide and face bright.</p>
<p>“Oh, Shuichi… Shuichi, Shuichi, Shuichi,” he said with a breathy sigh, snickering as he shook his head.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” Shuichi asked.</p>
<p>“First of all,” Kaito started. “This party isn’t going to be a huge thing. I was texting Maki Roll and she said that there’s gonna be less than twenty people there.”</p>
<p>“Ah, really?” Shuichi asked, kind of surprised. He figured someone like Kaede would throw something a bit bigger.</p>
<p>“Yup. Up close and personal with everyone,” Kaito said cheerfully. “Nextly-”</p>
<p>“That’s not a word,” Shuichi interrupted. Kaito glared at him for a solid five seconds before continuing.</p>
<p>“Nextly, just be yourself. There’s a whole stigma around parties and having to dress the right way and act a certain way. Parties are supposed to be fun, and this is more of a get together than a full-on party.” Kaito put his hands behind his head and looked at the ceiling. “Some people, like, drink and shit at parties when they don’t want to. No one cares if you don’t drink. It’s fuckin’ uni, man, y’know?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Shuichi replied. “Though, I doubt there’ll be much alcohol, because, you know, it’s a Tuesday,” he pointed out. Kaito shrugged apathetically.</p>
<p>“Besides,” the purple-haired boy added, “from what I heard from Maki Roll, it’s gonna be mainly people we know. So you don’t have to worry about a thing.”</p>
<p>“Okay…” Shuichi started to trail off, and then pulled himself into a sitting position. “But what do I wear? I don’t have many party clothes, or any at all, really…”</p>
<p>“Personally, I’m gonna roll up to the party in a pair of Maki Roll’s short shorts and one of Miu’s ‘Daddy’s Little Princess’ shirts,” Kaito said with a blank expression. Shuichi laughed as he adjusted his shirt, and Kaito continued on. “What’d you wear to Kaede’s performance?”</p>
<p>Just hearing her name was enough to make Shuichi’s nerves tingle. Isn’t it weird how when you like someone, when their name is brought up in conversation you immediately snap to rapt attention? “Uh, just a pair of jeans and a nice t-shirt.”</p>
<p>Kaito slapped his hands down on his knees. “Then wear a pair of jeans and a nice t-shirt,” he said. Shuichi cocked his head. </p>
<p>“I mean, I guess…” He sounded uncertain.</p>
<p>“You can borrow one of my shirts, if you’re ever so inclined,” Kaito offered. Shuichi gave him a slight smile.</p>
<p>“I might just take you up on that.” After Shuichi spoke, there was a comfortable silence between the two, with narration from the T.V filling the empty space. Shuichi slid down and rested his head on his pillow again, making a mental note to wash his bedsheets soon.</p>
<p>“So, you gonna try and talk to Kaede at this party? Kaito asked, the smirk on his face evident in his words. Shuichi rolled over and pressed his face into the pillows and groaned.</p>
<p>“I talk to her! I talked to her at the gym, I talked to her at study group today, I talk to her all the time!” Shuichi pointed out as he shifted so he could speak. Kaito rolled his eyes and shook his head.</p>
<p>“That’s not what I mean. That’s you guys talking in social situations. At this party, it’s gonna be night, you could be alone, and it’s Valentine’s Day…” Kaito raised his eyebrows and smiled. Shuichi balked at him, reddening.</p>
<p>“What are you saying?” he stuttered.</p>
<p>Kaito sighed. “I’m telling you to make a move. You know, like a romantic one? Kiss ‘er and sweep ‘er off her feet, make her yours, etcetera and etcetera,” he said. Shuichi gripped his pillow and pushed himself against it, embarrassed.</p>
<p>“Noooooo,” he groaned into his pillow.</p>
<p>“Don’t you want to?” Kaito asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Realizing what he said, Shuichi shot up from his bed, knocking his head on the bars atop him. “Ow!” he exclaimed, rubbing his head and baring his teeth. “I mean no… I mean yes…” Kaito watched him, amused.</p>
<p>“So, yes, you want to kiss Kaede. Understandable, because you like her and all,” Kaito reasoned. “I think you can do it. I mean, it’s Valentine’s Day. The timing literally couldn’t be more perfect,” he said as he clapped his hands together and grinned.</p>
<p>“But.. I’m too shy to even try anything.” He shuddered as he remembered Tenko’s threat from earlier in the evening. Kaito stroked his goatee thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“But you know who isn’t shy?” He didn’t give Shuichi time to answer. “Kaede. If she does like you, and coincidentally you end up alone, together, in her dorm, on her bed…” He was cut off suddenly by Shuichi.</p>
<p>“Shut up! Shut up right now! We are not even going to touch that!” he cried, his face bright red, heat prickling his skin uncomfortably. Without thinking, he grabbed his pillow and threw it at his roommate.</p>
<p>Kaito’s eyes widened, and he reached up reflexively to grab the pillow. “But you’re going to touch it, tomorrow night,” he said teasingly, flexing his fingers around the edges of Shuichi’s pillow. He began to speak in a high-pitched tone. “Oh, Shuichi, I’ve been in love with you for so long, haven’t you noticed?” he said, clasping his hands together and closing his eyes, for affect, the pillow dropping to the ground with a thump. “Everything I’ve been doing is for your sake!”</p>
<p>“I am not talking to you, ever again.” Shuichi spun around in his bed, the poor boy nearly dying of embarrassment. He faced the wall and pulled his blanket up over his head, pulling at the edges. Kaito continued to mock him in his less-than-good imitation of Kaede.</p>
<p>“<i>Oh</i>, Shuichi, take me!” he yelled, probably forgetting how thin the walls of the dorms were, and most definitely confusing and weirding out their neighbours. Shuichi blushed heavily, falling into the wall and pressing his forehead against the surface.</p>
<p>“You are the worst person I’ve ever met,” Shuichi claimed, clapping his hands over his ears.</p>
<p>Kaito was laughing hysterically by himself, and Shuichi was smirking in spite of himself. The blue-haired boy craned his neck slightly.</p>
<p>“Are you done? Are you pleased with yourself?” he asked with a deadpan tone. Kaito certainly looked happy as he snickered away, arms wrapped around his gut. In fact, he started coughing, he was laughing so hard. Shuichi watched him with a mixture of annoyance and amusement sparkling in his gaze.</p>
<p>“Oh, God,” Kaito said breathily, putting his hands to his face. “Oh, I crack myself up sometimes,” he snickered. “I need some water,” he inhaled sharply, shakily standing from his chair. Shuichi exhaled exaggeratedly as Kaito staggered away to the bathroom.</p>
<p>As his roommate ran the water in the sink, Shuichi sat and rubbed his cheeks, trying to regulate his blood flow back to everywhere else in his body and not just this face.  He ran his hands through his hair and sighed. He couldn’t even think of Kaede, let alone in <i>that</i> way, without becoming a blushing mess.</p>
<p>“Oh my God,” Kaito said as he ambled back into the room, water dripping from his mouth. He wiped his hand across his face.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Kaito,” Shuichi said icily. Kaito put a hand to his heart.</p>
<p>“Low blow, bro,” he snorted as we went back to his chair. “Hey, every word in that sentence rhymed!”</p>
<p>“Lovely,” Shuichi replied. Kaito leaned back in his chair and looked at Shuichi.</p>
<p>“Okay, but bro, if I’m being serious for a sec, here, I do really think Kaede likes you. You don’t have to do anything big, but, like…” Kaito trailed off, caught up in trying to find the right words for what he wanted to explain. “Drop a hint or summin’. Touch her arm. Hell, even count shoulders for all I care. I just want to see you happy, y’know?”</p>
<p>“I know,” Shuichi said. “I just… Get anxious around her. But maybe I’ll try, if I have you behind me.”</p>
<p>Kaito grinned widely. “That’s what I like to hear, bro. It’s a promise.”</p>
<p>“You got it, bro.”</p>

  <b>February 14th - Valentine's Day</b>
</p>
<p>“Kaitooooo, I don’t know what to wear!”</p>
<p>Shuichi stared at himself in the mirror, examining his body with a blank look on his face. He was scrutinizing every inch of his frame with a frown. He was wearing a pair of black jeans and no shirt, and he crossed his arms over his bare chest.</p>
<p>“Come out here, then! We’ll find you something!” Kaito’s voice called out from their room. Shuichi gave himself one last, meaningful look, and then stepped out of the bathroom and walked to their shared bedroom. Kaito was standing in a pair of loose-fitting purple-ish jeans and a white tank top, holding up different shirts and looking through them.</p>
<p>He looked up at Shuichi. “Here’s some shirts that I think would look good on you.” He lifted his arm, which was covered with different coloured, bright shirts. God, Kaito did own a lot of vibrant clothes. Shuichi picked out at least three with a galaxy pattern.</p>
<p>“Ah, thanks.” Shuichi gingerly took the armful from his roommate and laid them out on his bed. He rifled through the shirts, trying to find some that fit his monochrome aesthetic. As Kaito shuffled through his clothes, putting them back into their dresser, Shuichi lifted a white t-shirt with three dark grey stripes around the lower torso.</p>
<p>“I like this one,” he told Kaito. The purple-haired boy stuck out his lip and gave him a nod.</p>
<p>“Try it on,” he offered. Shuichi obliged, and pulled the tee over his head. Kaito was much more… built than he was, but the shirt fit him well enough. He fanned it out.</p>
<p>He stretched his arms out. “How do I look?” he asked, glancing down at his body. Kaito shut the dresser drawer with a bang and gave him a once-over, placing his hands on his hips.</p>
<p>“Lookin’ like hot stuff,” he said with a smirk.</p>
<p>“Ah, you think so…?” Shuichi asked, feeling a bit self-conscious. Kaito gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“I know so,” he said. Shuichi smiled. “Well, are you ready?” he asked as he ran his hands through his purple hair.</p>
<p>“Not really,” Shuichi admitted. Kaito approached him and slapped in on the back.</p>
<p>“Sure you are,” he said cheerfully. Shuichi shrugged nervously, and Kaito slung an arm around his neck.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s time,” he pointed out, jostling his roommate around with a hearty grin. “So you better prepare yourself.”</p>
<p>“Okay, Kaito,” Shuichi laughed nervously, gently reaching up to touch Kaito’s hand. </p>
<p>“Then let’s get to it,” he said, retracting his arm from Shuichi’s neck and patting his pocket.  He took a step towards the door.</p>
<p>“What’s Maki’s dorm?” Shuichi asked as Kaito rested his hand on the doorknob, about to open it.</p>
<p>“313,” he responded as he flung the door open. Shuichi followed him out into the hall, a torrent of distracting thoughts racing through his head, his guts twisting into knots. Kaito locked their door and they started off towards Maki and Kaede’s dorm room.</p>
<p>“So, are you excited?” Kaito’s words filled the silence between the two as they descended the stairs to the girls’ floor.</p>
<p>“Kind of? Yeah,” Shuichi replied, shoving his hands into his pockets. </p>
<p>“That’s good. I’m excited, too,” Kaito said brightly.</p>
<p>“Aren’t you nervous?” Shuichi asked. Kaito tipped his head from side to side, as if pondering the question.</p>
<p>“Well, what would I have to be nervous about?” he answered with another inquiry.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Shuichi said after a few seconds with no response. He thought for a moment. “Do you ever get nervous around Maki?”</p>
<p>Kaito exhaled a breathy sigh. “I mean, yeah. When we go to fancy restaurants and when I buy her a gift and I don’t know if she’ll like it. I always worry about if she still likes me or if she’s gonna break up with me and if she’s happy, not just with me, but in general.” He smiled slightly. “Then I remember that I love her more than anything else in the universe -<i>besides you</i>- and that I’d do anything for her. I trust her, so I don’t get anxious around her.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Really?” Kaito nodded with  a dreamy, far-off look upon his face. <i>Is that what love looks like…?</i> “Maki must feel lucky that she has a boyfriend like you,” Shuichi said to his roommate.</p>
<p>“Nah, I should be the one lucky to have her,” Kaito said. “Some people might look at her and see someone mean and cold, but I see so much more. She’s the sweetest girl I’ve ever met,” he mused with  smile.</p>
<p>“Ah,” Shuichi sighed. <i>I mean, Maki doesn’t exactly exude the aura of being a sweet and proper girl…</i> He thought silently to himself. He loved Maki, sure, but even he had to acknowledge that she could be terrifying when she wanted to.</p>
<p>“Hey look, we’re here,” Kaito said suddenly. Shuichi’s gaze snapped in front of them, and he saw the door Kaito had mentioned propped open with a door-stopper, a mixture of pop and piano music filtering out into the hallway. “You ready?”</p>
<p>“Ready as I’ll ever be,” Shuichi responded, and lifted his hand to knock on the door. He gave the door a sharp rapping before Kaito grabbed him by the wrist and pulled him into the room. “What-!”</p>
<p>“We have arrived!” Kaito shouted as the two stumbled into the dorm. </p>
<p>“Hey guys!” That was Kaede, who was playing a tune on an electric keyboard she had in her lap. She set it beside her and got up to greet them. Shuichi looked around. “I know, it’s kind of lame, but I’m lame, so it’s fitting.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you’re lame,” Shuichi mumbled without thinking. Kaede brightened.</p>
<p>“Really? Thanks,” she chirped. “Anyways, you can hop between dorms if you want. Miu and Tenko have their doors open. I think about half of the people are there?” She put a finger to her lips, thinking. “But you’re welcome to stay here!”</p>
<p>“This is the best dorm, though, so if you leave Shuichi, I’ll never forgive you,” Kokichi piped up from where he was sitting, draped over Rantaro.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shuichi, welcome to the party.” Rantaro offered a wave, compromised by Kokichi’s position. Kiibo, who looked awkward sitting beside the two, gave him a slight smile and a greeting.</p>
<p>“Hi, everyone,” Shuichi said finally. He crossed his arms, feeling, as they say, ‘out of his element.’ Kaede ushered him and Kaito in.</p>
<p>“Oh, you two are here.” Maki stepped out from behind one of the walls, presumably having been in the bathroom. She walked over to them, and Kaito put his arm around her and kissed her forehead. Maki hid her reddened face.</p>
<p>“Happy Valentine’s Day, babe,” he said as he rested his chin on the top of her head.</p>
<p>“You’ve said that five times today,” Maki mumbled, casually running her hands through one of her pigtails.</p>
<p>“Cute!” Kaede squealed. She clasped her hands together with a grin as Maki buried her face into Kaito’s chest. “But yeah, I mean, if you guys wanna hang out there, I’d be okay with that.” She took a step back and retreated to her bed, settling the keyboard onto her lap.</p>
<p>She punched out a few bars, going through a scale. “Don’t just stand there,” she said, her fingers not once breaking form as she spoke. “Grab a drink or some snacks and hang out!”</p>
<p>“Oh,” Shuichi said, as if surprised. Feeling a bit awkward, he slid next to Rantaro and Kokichi without taking anything as Kaito and Maki talked with each other.</p>
<p>“Aloha, Shuichi!” Kokichi chirped, tipping a small cup of some purple-coloured liquid back and forth. “I feel like I haven’t seen you in forever!”</p>
<p>“You just saw me a few days ago, and you’ll probably see me tomorrow,” Shuichi pointed out. Kokichi took a sip of his drink.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s a relative term, we’re never getting there,” he mused. Rantaro put a hand on the boy’s shoulder and smiled.</p>
<p>“How are you, Shuichi?” he asked. Kokichi shifted in Rantaro’s lap.</p>
<p>“I’m doing pretty okay, how are you?” Shuichi replied. He noticed Kiibo leaning forward slightly.</p>
<p>“Ditto,” Rantaro said in response. “Except this one has claimed me as his property, apparently.” He cast a glance down at Kokichi, who was sitting like a flipped-over beetle.</p>
<p>“It’s ‘cuz you love meee,” he sang. Rantaro patted him on the head.</p>
<p>“Sure,” he said simply. Kokichi pouted.</p>
<p>“And how about you, Kiibo?” Shuichi said, looking at the boy. He had been oddly quiet throughout the conversation, as if he had been zoning out, Kiibo’s gaze snapped to Shuichi and he gave him a smile. “How are you?”</p>
<p>“I’m fine, thanks for asking,” he said, scratching the back of his head. Shuichi blinked.</p>
<p>“You sure? You seem out of it,” Shuichi asked.</p>
<p>Kiibo shrugged. “Just feeling a little under the weather, I suppose. But I wanted to come along so that <i>he</i> didn’t do anything stupid.” He gave Kokichi a pointed glare, to which Kokichi responded with sticking his tongue out jokingly.</p>
<p>“Aww, Kii-boy, you care too much!” he snickered. The conversation between the four fizzled out and Shuichi glanced around Kaede’s dorm. Shuichi recognized the decorations that he, Kiibo, and Kokichi bought for the party hung up. Some relevant pop song played in the background as Kaede played the keyboard. His gaze lingered on her for a while, watching her with a fond smile as she played. Even though it was only on a small, electronic keyboard, her eyes were focused on the keys, determined.</p>
<p>When he managed to pull his eyes away from the girl, his eyes met Kaito’s, who gave him a thumbs up and angled his head towards Kaede. Shuichi flattened his lips and looked away, feeling anxiety stir inside of him.</p>
<p>“Hey, Tittymatsu!” Shuichi jumped in his seat at the sound of a sharp call coming from the entrance. He looked to see Miu, dressed in a low-cut red shirt, crashing into the dorm room. She was clutching a glass that was probably-most-definitely filled with some sort of alcohol. Tsumugi tripped in after her.</p>
<p>“Miu?” Kaede’s eyebrows knit. Miu stood straight, putting her free hand on her hip. Tsumugi stood behind her with a hand on her shoulder, likely to steady her.</p>
<p>“First of all, your keyboard shit is coming through the walls and into my dorm. Not into it,” she said harshly. “Also, this party needs to get bumpin’!” She waltzed through the room and plopped down directly beside Kiibo, stretching her legs out. “Didn’t you say you were gonna set up some lame party games, or what-the-fuck-ever?”</p>
<p>“Um…” Kaede looked a bit flustered. Understandably, really. “I mean, I guess?” She slid the keyboard off of her lap. Tsumugi gave her an apologetic smile. Miu kicked her legs in the air and Kiibo discreetly looked away.</p>
<p>“Let’s play, like, something personal that really makes the fabric of your pants stretch,” Miu said loudly. “It’s fuck, marry, kill, but you actually have to do it to the people you choose. I want to see some death and some hardcore pornography in this fuckin’ Chili’s tonight!” she hooted, a little too excited. Shuichi cringed at her words.</p>
<p>“Miu, I don’t condone homicide in my dorm room,” Maki said, glaring at the blonde-haired girl. Miu looked at her scrutinizingly. </p>
<p>“‘Shwhatevs, you tsundere fuck. You’re just salty because you have to host this party instead of getting dicked down by the space man beside you.” She flicked her finger outwards to point at Maki and Kaito. Maki looked down at the ground and Kaito rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “Man, Shyhara, do you have to put up with all their noise when they fuck?” Shuichi tensed upon being addressed, but Miu kept speaking before he could answer.</p>
<p>“Or you, Bakamatsu, do these kids keep you up with their moans?” Miu’s gaze snapped to Kaede. The girl twisted a strand of hair around her fingers. “Or, or-” Her eyes lit up. “Do those two fuckers take one dorm and you and Shyhara take the other? Holy shit, I bet that’s it!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Miu, shut up,” Maki hissed. Miu grinned cheekily, lifting her glass to her lips and taking a big gulp.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for this,” Tsumugi apologized.</p>
<p>“I mean, she’s got a point,” Kokichi hummed, to which he was silenced by Rantaro pressing his hand to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’ve got a great idea to undercut y’all motherfuckers' sexual tension.” Miu sat up. “A game of spin the bottle,” she said darkly with a wide smile.</p>
<p>“Spin the bottle? What are we, in grade six?” Kokichi grabbed Rantaro’s hand and tore it away from his mouth. Miu tipped her glass towards him.</p>
<p>“I mean, you look like you are,” she said. “But nah. I mean, you’d fuck every guy in this room, wouldn’t you?”</p>
<p>“I mean, I’d like to think that I have higher standards than Kaito,” Kokichi sighed. Kaito narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Fuck you, too, then,” he said to Kokichi, tightening his grip around Maki. Shuichi was about to tell Miu that she shouldn’t be so vulgar (it wouldn’t have worked) when Kaede suddenly piped up. </p>
<p>“I think that a game of spin the bottle would be fun,” she said. Everyone turned to look at her, surprised. She held up her hands in defense. “I just mean that it’s Valentine’s Day and it’s a fun little party game and we’re all consenting adults.”</p>
<p>“Damn, Kaede, you’re thirsty, but I’m liking it!” Miu jumped out of her seat. “I’ll go get an empty bottle, because God knows I’ve got those in my dorm!” she called as she ran out of the dorm, leaving a bunch of stunned silent university kids in her wake.</p>
<p>“She’s, um, a bit of a handful, isn’t she?” Tsumugi lamented as she stared at the door. She crossed her arms and rested her face on her hand. “Sometimes I wonder why I follow her around and then I figure that someone’s gotta do it.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, Tsumugi, I’m so sorry that your roomie, or girlfriend, or whatever she is to you, is one vulgar bitch,” Kokichi said. Tsumugi flushed.</p>
<p>“She’s not my girlfriend, but you shouldn’t say things like that, Kokichi,” Tsumugi responded. Kaede waved her hands around.</p>
<p>“Well, guys, it might be fun, so let’s just give it a chance,” she said brightly. Shuichi looked at her and smiled nervously. On the inside, he was panicking. He hadn’t played spin the bottle since he was in high school, he was going to be doing it with a girl he liked, and there was always the added bonus of Miu and her off-the-cuff comments. He fidgeted with the collar of his shirt.</p>
<p>“Alright, bitches, let’s get this shit started!” Miu hollered as she returned, clutching a brown glass bottle, seemingly having discarded her glass from earlier. She plopped down in the centre of the dorm and set the bottle in front of her. “Gather around, halfwits!”</p>
<p>Begrudgingly, Shuichi edged towards Miu. The rest followed suit, taking their seats in a circle around the bottle. “Now, guys, let me explain the rules. You get someone once, it’s a kiss on the cheek. Twice, it’s on the lips. Thrice, and it’s seven minutes in fuckin’ heaven!” she laughed loudly. Kiibo raised his hand.</p>
<p>“Uh, let me get one thing straight,” he started.</p>
<p>“You’ve already lost me,” Kokichi replied, resting on Rantaro’s leg. Kiibo rolled his eyes.</p>
<p>“So, like…” He looked a little awkward. “Is it, shall we say, mandatory to do… Indecent things during seven minutes in heaven?” His eyes fell to the floor as Miu started laughing loudly, unable to respond.</p>
<p>“Well, no, Kiibo,” Kaede spoke up. “There’s, um, a pretense of what’s going to happen, but you can just have a conversation with the other person.” She balled her hands into fists on her knees.</p>
<p>“Or you can fuck,” Miu interjected.</p>
<p>“Seven minutes, Miu?” Kokichi blinked. He put a finger to his lips. “That’s adequate at best, though I guess we should expect that from you.”</p>
<p>“You can go seven-minutes-in-heaven yourself, Kokichi,” Miu growled snarkily. Kokichi, wearing a shit-eating grin, took a sip of his soda. Kaede slammed her hands on the carpeted floor.</p>
<p>“Who wants to start?” she asked, looking exasperated. Shuichi felt a pang of sympathy. <i>Must be hard having Miu as a neighbour, even with Tsumugi trying to calm her down.</i> Maki snorted and crossed her arms.</p>
<p>“Do I have to participate in this childish game?” she muttered. Kaito put his hand on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Come on, Maki Roll, it’ll be fun!” he insisted. Maki looked at the floor with a hard glare, then relented quickly after.</p>
<p>“I guess…” she settled into the circle. “But I reserve the right to not kiss any of you losers.”</p>
<p>“Your words wound me,” Kokichi snickered. Maki stared at him.</p>
<p>“Anyways, would anyone like to start?” Kaede repeated. Miu reeled forward and put her hand on the bottle, then pushed it slightly forward, towards Shuichi.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shyhara, in the mood to cop a feel?” she said, cocking her head to the side. Shuichi scratched his cheek. “Go on. I can tell you don’t get any action.”</p>
<p>“Um…” Shuichi felt the blood in his veins run cold. Everyone was looking at him with eager eyes, and he suddenly felt the unstoppable urge to get up and run out of the dorm and go to his own and cry. With a shaky hand, he rested his fingers on the bottle. “Okay.” He gripped it as firmly as he could, still trembling, then spun it and shut his eyes tightly.</p>
<p>After a few moments, he opened them slightly, his stomach jumping up and down. That’s when he saw the bottle had stopped, and the neck was pointing to Kaito. Shuichi let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding, then immediately turned to look at Maki.</p>
<p>She looked slightly amused. “If it’s you, I don’t mind.” Shuichi pulled his eyebrows together. Kaito was grinning brightly, as usual.</p>
<p>“Get over here and give your bestest pal a kiss,” he said cheerfully. Shuichi sighed, feeling awkward, and leaned towards the other boy. Everyone else in the circle was smiling, like they were just incredibly into watching an anxious kid kiss his best friend.</p>
<p>Shuichi pressed his face to Kaito’s cheek, his lips barely grazing the skin’s surface. His face was… warm. <i>Did I expect it to be freezing?</i> Embarrassed, he drew his body back to his spot. Kaito chuckled to himself. Kokichi cheered.</p>
<p>“Hell yeah! We’re starting off this game right!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“That was laaaaame,” Miu complained. “No feeling at all. Whatevs. Space boy, your go,” she said, tilting back and forth slightly. Tsumugi put a hand on her arm, looking slightly pensive.</p>
<p>“Alrighty!” He rubbed his hands together, then eagerly spun the bottle. It spun around once before landing to his right- where Maki was sitting. Kaito grinned widely. “Awesome!” He turned and pressed a kiss happily to Maki’s cheek. The girl flushed slightly.</p>
<p>“Cheater!” Miu accused.</p>
<p>“How the hell do you cheat in a game of chance?” Kaito shot back. Maki leaned forward and grabbed the bottle, giving it a harsh spin. She glared at it as it rotated around, and eventually came to a stop with it pointing across from her- to Kaede. Shuichi’s breath hitched.</p>
<p>Kaede’s eyes widened, like she hadn’t even realized that her being picked was a very real possibility. “Oh, um, Maki, you don’t have to if you don’t want to...” she offered. Maki shook her head.</p>
<p>“What do I look like? Some sort of coward?” As if taking Kaede’s words as a challenge, Maki stretched her body over the bottle and beckoned Kaede to come closer. The girl, looking surprised, leaned towards Maki.</p>
<p>With a sigh, Maki kissed her roomate gently. Shuichi glanced at Kaito and the two exchanged a look. Without words, a mental thought passed between them.</p>
<p>“So, like, when are we gonna start getting double and triple ups? Because that’s when the game starts to get interesting,” Kokichi asked.</p>
<p>“It just started,” Rantaro pointed out.</p>
<p>“Kokichi, I know you just want to get into someone’s pants, but hold your fuckin’ horses,” Miu said. She slapped her knee. “Get it? Horses? Kokichi? God, I’m a fucking genius,” she snickered to herself, clearly amusing herself more than the other participants.</p>
<p>“I don’t think genius means what you think it means, Miu,” Kokichi said mockingly. Kaede put her hand on the bottle and shook her head.</p>
<p>“No more fighting. It’s my turn, right? Right.” Shuichi felt a tremor of nerves go through him as Kaede spoke. He forced a smile up onto his lips and twiddled his fingers as she wound up the bottle and let it go. </p>
<p>It spun for a short while before landing on…</p>
<p>
  <i>Oh my God.</i>
</p>
<p>Shuichi was overcome by a sudden weakness in his entire body as he stared at the bottle, which was pointing towards him. He was trembling visibly, he was sure, and he felt a wave of anxiety pummel the insides of his guts.</p>
<p>He swallowed a lump in his throat as his and Kaede’s eyes met. He barely registered the world around him until he felt Kaito pat him on the back and realized Kaede was speaking to him.</p>
<p>“Shuichi? Are you okay with this?” she asked, looking concerned. Shuichi nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he answered breathily. Kaede smiled warmly and then leaned over towards him. Shuichi could hear his heartbeat in his ears as she brought her face up close to his and planted a kiss on his cheek. <i>So soft… So warm… Aughhh…</i> He felt his eyes drift shut subconsciously. </p>
<p>Kaede drew back and Shuichi was filled with an sudden urge for more, but he bit his tongue. “Damn, Shyhara, you’re trembling like a leaf,” Miu commented. “Got a boner yet?” she added crassly.</p>
<p>“Hey now, Miu,” Tsumugi murmured. Ignoring Miu, Shuichi cleared his throat.</p>
<p>“S-so, it’s my turn now,” he started, cursing himself for stuttering. He fumbled with the bottle and spun it, hoping that it’d land on Kaede, but it didn’t because that’d be too convenient. Instead it went to Kokichi.</p>
<p>“Now <i>I</i> finally get some action!” Kokichi said, a little too excited. He lurched forward from Rantaro’s lap and towards Shuichi. The latter rolled his eyes as the group around them chuckled softly. Shuichi kissed an eager Kokichi on the cheek.</p>
<p>“Hmm…” Kokichi said, tipping his head from side to side. “I’d give it a solid 7/10. You can’t do much with a cheek kiss, but it’s pleasant enough. Good job, Shuichi.” Shuichi flattened his lips. Kokichi grabbed ahold of the bottle. “Did you guys know that there’s a surefire way to get someone in this game? You just have to do a few theoretical calculations and then…” He spun the bottle, which landed on Kiibo. “Or maybe I’m lying and it’s just luck-based!”</p>
<p>Kiibo reddened as Kokichi leaned close to him and held his face, cupping his hands around his cheeks. He kissed him rather aggressively before letting him go, leaving poor Kiibo flustered and embarrassed. “Aren’t I a good kisser, Kii-boy?” Kokichi hummed.</p>
<p>“Um… Sure,” Kiibo responded with uncertainty. He flicked the bottle and it… Huh… Went right back to Kokichi? Shuichi gaped as Kiibo’s eyes widened, looking panicked.</p>
<p>“Alright, we got our first mouth kiss!” Miu hooted. “Tongue is not required but is recommended,” she added slyly. Kiibo pushed his fingers together nervously.</p>
<p>“Eh, Kiibo, don’t listen to Miu,” Kaito put in. Miu flipped him the bird. </p>
<p>“It’s okay, Kii-boy, my mouth is all yours,” Kokichi said proudly. Kiibo cringed.</p>
<p>“Please don’t say it like that,” he pleaded. Nervously, he slid his hand across Kokichi’s face, looking awkward. Kokichi was smiling devilishly as Shuichi watched the two with a bit of a knowing look. As Kiibo brought their lips together, Kokichi suddenly wrapped his arms around his roommate’s body and pulled him closer.</p>
<p>Kiibo looked startled, but the two didn’t break apart until after a few moments. After the ordeal, his eyes were wide and his face was bright red. Miu laughed obnoxiously. “Oh man, you horny bastards, save it for the seven minutes in heaven!” Kokichi put a hand to his mouth as he chuckled, clearly unaffected, while Kiibo pulled his hair over his eyes, looking shy.</p>
<p>“Kokichi, you better take your turn before poor Kiibo jizzes all over his little tightie-whities,” Miu put in yet another obscene sentence.</p>
<p>“Hey, Miu, shut up, please.” Maki glowered. Kiibo looked like he had shut down and was staring at the floor. Kokichi gladly took the bottle and spun it around- Shuichi noticed that Kiibo wasn’t the only one who was blushing.</p>
<p>“Rantaro!” Kokichi exclaimed as the bottle came to a stop. He stretched up and pecked the green-haired boy on the cheek with flourish. Rantaro patted him on the head.</p>
<p>“You’re so enthusiastic, Kokichi,” he chuckled, then leaned in and spun the bottle for himself. “Ah, Tsumugi.” It came to a slow halt and landed on the blue-haired girl. She put her hand on her chin.</p>
<p>“Oh, um…” She pushed up her glasses. “Alright,” she said.</p>
<p>“Relax, it’s all good.” Rantaro, with a bit of trouble due to his Kokichi situation, leaned in close to Tsumugi and kissed her on the cheek. He pulled back with a slight smile on his face. “Hope it didn’t make you too uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>Tsumugi beamed at him. “Oh, not at all!” she said. “So, it’s my turn then?” She reached down and gave the bottle a whirl. When it came to its head, it was pointing towards Miu.</p>
<p>“Ugh, finally,” Miu mumbled. Tsumugi looked bashful as she placed a hesitant kiss on her roommate’s face, to which Miu responded with a giddy grin. “Hell fuckin’ yeah, now everyone’s gotten a turn, and the real shit can begin.”</p>
<p>The blonde stared intensely at the bottle before giving it a hearty spin, clapping her hands together as it turned around and around. It slowed and eventually stopped on Kaede. “Aw, really, Bakamatsu?” Miu said incredulously. “Oh well, get your lackluster rack over here,” she sighed exaggeratedly. </p>
<p>“Listen, I didn’t come here to be insulted,” Kaede said as she obliged. Miu pursed her lips and pressed them to the blonde girl’s cheek, like she was disgusted by the prospect of kissing the girl. Kaede rolled her eyes as she pulled back.</p>
<p>“You know you love me, Miu,” she said as her hand came to rest on the bottle. Miu narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“I mean, you can just keep thinking that,” she muttered in response. Shuichi looked intently at Kaede as she spun the bottle around. Now, it’d just be wishful thinking for him to hope that it’d come to him again. That was close to impossible- there was, like, ⅛ chance in that happening, if he was doing his math right.</p>
<p>So, there was no way-</p>
<p>“Shuichi again?”</p>
<p>Kaito balked at the bottle, which had, surely enough, stopped with the neck pointing towards Shuichi. Then he brandished a large grin and slapped Shuichi unsubtly on the back. Shuichi’s response? He felt somewhat numb for a few moments as the situation registered in his mind, before his nerves grabbed ahold of every part of his body. It was like his cerebellum fused. His blood turned to ice beneath his skin.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move or think properly.</p>
<p>
  <i>I’m about to kiss Kaede.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>On the lips.</i>
</p>
<p>In the midst of his anxiety he was hit with a strong feeling of self-consciousness, not unlike a spear going through is chest. He hadn’t had a partner in a while and, by the same token, hasn’t kissed anyone on the mouth in a romantic sense for a long time.</p>
<p><i>No no no no no I can’t do this she’s going to think I’m a horrible kisser and hate me forever.</i> His thoughts raged through his mind, and more than once he entertained the thought of disappearing or crawling into a hole and dying.</p>
<p>“Shuichi? Are you okay? We don’t have to kiss if you don’t want to.” Shuichi remembered that this was real life and realized he was staring awkwardly into Kaede’s eyes, you know, like a creep.</p>
<p>“Take the shot, Shuichi!” Kokichi chided. Shuichi swallowed and nodded.</p>
<p>“No, it’s alright.” His heart was pounding in his chest, his entire body trembling as Kaede leaned in towards him. Kaito gently pushed him forward, towards the girl, and Shuichi started to panic. What did he do? Did he part his lips? Was there the pretense of tongue? Holy hell, he didn’t know what was going on!</p>
<p>Kaede was so close, Shuichi could feel her body heat. He suppressed the urge to move backwards. Before he knew it, Kaede’s lips were on his, and he felt warmth spiral all throughout his body. He became hyper-aware of everything around him, his own stunted breaths, the softness of the girl’s lips, and how it felt to have her hand cupped around his face.</p>
<p>It was like time had slowed.</p>
<p>But it was over as quick as it started, with the two retreating back to their spots with pink faces. Shuichi put his sweaty hands to his face, still shaking. Kaede watched him shyly from beneath her eyelashes.</p>
<p>“Holy fuck, it would take a samurai sword to cut the sexual tension between the two of y’all, because hot damn there’s a shit-ton,” Miu weighed in unhelpfully. Shuichi’s fingers brushed his lips and he was overcome with a sense of urgency. He wanted more from Kaede, feel her body on his, and move to the tune of their heartbeats.</p>
<p>He then mentally berated himself for thinking such indecent thoughts. He shook his head, ignoring the perspiration that had formed on his forehead, and spun the bottle. Right then, at that moment, he was both a cocktail of combined anxiousness and fearlessness. He was determined to take things a bit further-</p>
<p>But he knew he’d wuss out when he got the chance.</p>
<p>And the chance came earlier than he expected.</p>
<p>Because just like it did with Kiibo and Kokichi-</p>
<p>The bottle froze in place on Kaede. Shuichi was stunned. <i>I take it back I am not ready for this. Dammit, why can’t my hormones just decide what they want?</i></p>
<p>“Well hooty-fucking-hoo, the emo perv and the small-titted piano freak are the first to go knock boots in the closet!” Miu cheered. Shuichi tensed immediately and looked down at his hands, feeling his face burn with shame and embarrassment. A new, indiscernible emotion shot through the air as Shuichi cautiously lifted his face and risked a glance at Kaede.</p>
<p>She looked surprised, but was smiling- if it was genuine or a nervous response, Shuichi didn’t know. “U-um,” she stuttered out. “Okay. Let’s go, Shuichi.” She stood abruptly, not making eye-contact with anyone in the circle.</p>
<p>“You got this, bro,” Kaito whispered to Shuichi as he got to his feet. Maki gave him a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Ooooo,” Kokichi jeered. “I hope you two have practiced safe sex! Remember, if your friend doesn’t want tea, do not unhinge their jaw and pour tea down their throat!” he called as Shuichi and Kaede exchanged an uncomfortable look.</p>
<p>“Jesus Christ, Kokichi,” Rantaro muttered. He looked up at the flustered pair. “We’ll come get you guys in seven minutes. Just chill- you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to,” he said with a comforting smile.</p>
<p>“Thanks, Rantaro,” Kaede said. Shuichi tried to speak but no words came out. “Well, let’s go,” she said with a forced chuckle. The two braced themselves and walked over to a small closet shared by Kaede and Maki, gingerly opened the door, and stepped in.</p>
<p>It was dark inside, but Shuichi could make out the shapes of clothes and some loose papers. “Sorry for  the mess,” Kaede apologized, sitting down on a pile of shirts. Shuichi shrugged and kicked away some of the clothing to make himself a spot, then took a seat.</p>
<p>They sat in a tense, uncomfortable silence for a few moments.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry,” Shuichi suddenly blurted out. Kaede tipped her head to the side.</p>
<p>“What for?” she asked.</p>
<p>“This,” Shuichi replied, gesturing around the closet, “is my fault. I’m sorry that you had to get stuck here with me, of all people. We don’t even have to talk if you don’t want to. We can sit in silence if that makes it better.”</p>
<p>Kaede’s eyes widened momentarily, then she laughed. “Oh, Shuichi, you’re so silly!” she exclaimed. “It’s just the entire idea of this whole seven minutes in heaven thing. It’s not because of you or anything, not at all,” she promised, clasping her hands together and twiddling her thumbs.</p>
<p>There was a small break where they sat in the quiet. Laughter and yelling (from Miu) filtered in through the thin walls. “Shuichi, you shouldn’t freak out so much. You’re a cool guy. You don’t always have to act like everyone is above you,” Kaede said after a while, glancing at the wall.</p>
<p>“Oh…” Shuichi’s heart skipped a beat. “Thanks.”</p>
<p>There was more silence. Shuichi was getting increasingly impatient with the lack of anything romantic happening, but whenever he tried to set anything in motion, the words died on his lips. He looked around the closet, anywhere but Kaede’s face.</p>
<p>“Oh my God,” Kaede sighed after a few beats. “I’m sooo stupid.” She put her head in her hands.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Shuichi questioned as the girl shook her head.</p>
<p>“I feel so on edge and nervous. Like I really want to talk to you normally, but I just can’t. Do you ever feel that way?” Kaede looked up at him with eyes that glowed in the half-light. Shuichi licked his lips.</p>
<p>“I totally get you,” he responded. Kaede leaned in slightly closer to him.</p>
<p>“You probably think I’m pretty awkward, huh?” she asked, tittering slightly.</p>
<p>“Ah… No. I’m a lot for awkward than you are,” Shuichi told her. Kaede let out a laugh that sounded like music to his ears.</p>
<p>“Sure, if that’s what you think,” she said snarkily. Shuichi smiled slightly. Kaede shifted in her spot, rustling the clothes she was sitting on. “But I don’t think that’s a bad thing, perse. I actually…” She trailed off, looking at her feet. “Think it’s pretty cute.”</p>
<p>Shuichi felt a new surge of heat shoot up his neck. “Really?”</p>
<p>“Did I just say that out loud? I did.” Kaede grit her teeth. “Sorry, I just made this really weird! Dangit!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Kaede. Don’t worry, it’s not weird. I’m actually flattered,” Shuichi responded. Kaede looked at him, bewildered.</p>
<p>“Really?” She balked. “Oh, er, that’s good.”</p>
<p>More silence settled between them. “Ugh, this feels so tense,” Kaede complained. She took a deep breath and looked around rapidly. Then she closed her eyes. “I guess this is as good as a time as any,” she mumbled, half to herself.</p>
<p>Shuichi shifted closer to her. “What do you mean?” Kaede exhaled sharply.</p>
<p>“I like you, Shuichi.”</p>
<p>It was like a jolt of electricity had torn through his chest, warmth spreading like a fire through his entire body, the flames licking at his skin. “You do?” he asked in a bit of a quiet voice. His heart was pounding against his ribcage.</p>
<p>“I do. I really do, and I’m sorry if you don’t feel the same way, but I just had to tell you,” Kaede rambled, the words spilling from her like water. “I half-threw this party so I could talk to you more, but I was awkward and dumb, and I couldn’t bring myself to do it, and now we’re here and you’re looking at me weirdly and I just messed this up big time, didn’t I?” She took a moment to stop and breathe. Shuichi watched her, shocked and amused.</p>
<p>“No…” Shuichi started, his voice cracking. “I, um, I like you t-too, Kaede…”</p>
<p>“What? Really?” Kaede exclaimed, then her hands flew to her mouth to cover it. “Sorry.”</p>
<p>“I do… I thought I was really obvious,” Shuichi admitted. Kaede smiled so brightly and fully that Shuichi couldn’t even look at her directly.</p>
<p>“Well, uh, that’s cool,” she said, tapping her fingers on her leg. “So… What do we do now?” She looked around the dark closet, the smile never leaving her face. Shuichi was struck with a sense of boldness- he was feeling a little delirious, understandably.</p>
<p>“We still have some more time in here,” he reminded her. Kaede’s eyes flew open.</p>
<p>“Oh, Shuichi, you sly dog you…” she said, pulling her hair over her face. Shuichi bit his lip. “Or should I call you Shuichi-kun now…?”</p>
<p><i>Oh. Wow.</i> Hearing his first name on her lips made his stomach jump and warmth spiral throughout his chest. He liked the way it sounded on her tongue. “Yes please,” he said in a bit of a whimper. Kaede rested her hand on his face, sending tingles through his skin.</p>
<p>“You’re adorable like this,” she said. Shuichi let out a squeak and he fell backward, his back against the wall. Kaede moved from her spot and settled herself between Shuichi’s legs. She leaned over him and their bodies touched- Shuichi didn’t recoil reflexively, but instead pressed his form into Kaede. He swallowed as she brought her face up close to him. Her body heat radiated off of her in waves, speaking to Shuichi in an indescribable, pleasurable way.</p>
<p>“Are you sure you’re okay with this?” Kaede asked. Her breath was hot on Shuichi’s face. Gingerly, he lifted his arms and placed his hands on Kaede’s back.</p>
<p>“Yes,” Shuichi responded quietly. “Aka- I mean… Kaede.”</p>
<p>Kaede blinked, her lilac eyes shining just centimetres away from him. “Oh, wow, okay. Didn’t expect that to feel so good,” she murmured.</p>
<p><i>Yeah, me neither. And not just about the names.</i> Shuichi pulled Kaede closer to him.  “I’m ready,” he told her. Kaede nodded slightly, parted her lips, and moved in closer to Shuichi.</p>
<p>The moment their lips connected, it was like fireworks went off in Shuichi’s brain. Kaede was so warm and soft, and she fit perfectly against Shuichi. He’d never done drugs, but he imagined that this was what it felt like to be high. He felt intoxicated, drunk off her body heat. His fingers reached up to entangle themselves in her silky blonde hair.</p>
<p>He didn’t really know what he was doing, but he let Kaede take the lead. The inside of her mouth was warm as she pressed herself into him. Shuichi let himself get lost in the way their bodies moved and the feeling of her tongue on the inside of his cheek.</p>
<p>Euphoria? Is that what they called it?</p>
<p>Whatever the term, Kaede was a ride that Shuichi didn’t want to get off. Her hands encapsulated his face, pulling them closer together. Shuichi had never felt this way before. The only things in the world at that moment were him and Kaede.</p>
<p>Slowly, she drew back from him. She swiped her thumb gently over his lips, and the two stared at each other dumbly as they caught their breath. Shuichi felt like he was on fire, his chest about to burst. Kaede blinked at him. </p>
<p>“I don’t want to stop,” she said breathlessly. Instead of responding with words, Shuichi pulled her down to him. He took one of his hands and placed his fingers on her chin, tilting her lips close to him. Icy grey eyes met bright purple ones, and he connected their lips again. <i>I don’t want to stop either, Kaede,</i> he thought to himself. It was weird what a lustful urgency did to a person.</p>
<p>Shuichi didn’t feel scared or anxious anymore. It was only him and Kaede that mattered to him at that very moment. He couldn’t think of anything else other than having her on his lips. He couldn’t hear the other people playing their game outside the door.</p>
<p>
  <i>It’s only us.</i>
</p>
<p>His eyes flitted shut, feeling both calm and ecstatic at the same time- two emotions that shouldn’t be able to coexist somehow struck a perfect balance. Pure bliss, with his heart skipping along, his skin burning from their body heat.</p>
<p>If only they could stay like this forever…</p>
<p>“Okayyyyy, your seven minutes is- HOLY FUCKING <i>FUCK</i>!”</p>
<p>The door flew open, and light poured into the closet, casting yellowish, artificial light on the conjoined bodies of Shuichi and Kaede. Miu stood in the doorway, looking stunned, with the other members of the game scurrying around her to look.</p>
<p>“I was kidding when I said y’all were fuckin’, but holy shit Shyhara, I hope you kept some rubbers in your back pocket!” Kaede tumbled off of Shuichi, her face bright red. Shuichi was mortified, his eyes wide and cheeks burning.</p>
<p>“Wh-what are you talking about?!” Shuichi exclaimed, flushed and embarrassed as he struggled to his feet. Miu laughed heartily.</p>
<p>“You know exactly what I mean, you horny bastard! Have some decency, there are other people in the room!” she yelled, enjoying every bit of this. “Ohhhh man, if you two fuckers were borderline boning in there, I can’t wait to see what compromising pose Kiibo and Kokichi are in when they’re done!”</p>
<p>Trembling from both exhilaration and shame, Shuichi stumbled out of the closet. His gaze blurry and adjusting to the light, he saw Kaito grinning widely and giving him a big thumbs up. Shuichi, still in a daze, smiled dreamily.</p>
<p>He suddenly felt a hand grab his own and turned to see Kaede smiling brightly at him. “Everyone,” she started, sounding a bit out of breath, “this is my new boyfriend.” She raised her arms above their heads. “Shuichi-kun.”</p>
<p>Shuichi stared at her, stars exploding in his eyes. “Hell yeah, Shuichi!” That was Kaito, bounding up to him and giving him a firm slap on his back. “Congrats!”</p>
<p>“Took you two long enough,” Maki sighed, smiling slightly. Rantaro patted Kaede on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“I agree. Congratulations, you guys,” he offered, while Tsumugi grinned to herself.</p>
<p>“Yet another OTP of mine has become canon,” she sighed. “Hopefully Kokichi gets with Kiibo or you next, Rantaro.” She said the second part mostly to herself.</p>
<p>“If you guys need some shit to help spice up your sex life, I’m your woman,” Miu said brashly. Kaede cringed.</p>
<p>“We’re good, thanks.” She turned to look at Shuichi and gave him a sweet, genuine smile, her face still red and flushed. As he felt her hand in his, his heart racing in his chest, he felt like he was on top of the world.</p>
<p>With Kaede by his side, he could already feel life starting to brighten.</p>
