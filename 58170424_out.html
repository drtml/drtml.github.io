<div class="userstuff">
<p>The summer festival is always a huge event for Shuichi's otherwise rather quiet home city. He can usually hear the loudspeakers even from home, but he's never been to it himself.</p><p>His uncle offered to take him, some years, when he had time off, but Shuichi declined. Crowds make him nervous, and he felt it would be a waste. Going alone felt kind of pathetic, and going with his uncle... The festival is famous for dates. He would have felt out of place. </p><p>Today, however, he's standing at the bus stop in front of the festival entrance and waits. He's wearing a yukata, also a first, and feels a little odd.</p><p>When Kaede asked him to go, he said yes without thinking. Now he finds himself increasingly antsy - was it today? Is he too early? Did she really mean to ask him? Did she even ask him? Should he have brought a gift?</p><p> </p><p>"Shuichi!"</p><p> </p><p>Several questions get answered when her melodic voice rings through the air. Her geta clack against the asphalt as she comes running, face bright with a smile, waving at him.</p><p>She's wearing a yukata, too - white and littered with stitched sakura petals. Her hair is bound up into a high bun and fixed by a silver pin. She's breathtakingly gorgeous, and Shuichi feels underdressed in her presence.</p><p>"Sorry I'm late!", Kaede says, coming to a halt in front of him, completely out of breath, "I couldn't find my hairpin! This one belonged to my great-grandma, and was passed down to my mother and then-" She stops abruptly. "Sorry, am I trailing off? I didn't even say hello! Oh Shuichi, you look beautiful."</p><p>"A-ah?!"</p><p>Kaede always uses such words for him.</p><p>
<em>Beautiful. Pretty. Cute.</em>
</p><p>Shuichi would have settled for the category of <em>passes as more than a clothing hanger</em>.</p><p>"Um, thank you... Ah, you too!"</p><p>She smiles, and Shuichi feels his face heat up. She's wearing light make up, her lips shimmer and her plum eyes come to full view with her light blue eye shadow. </p><p>"Alright!" She reaches out and takes his hand. "Let's go!"</p><p>Kaede drags him along with a light giggle, and Shuichi hurriedly stumbles after her.</p><p>The street is crowded with people, so Kaede takes his hand like it's the most normal thing in the world to do. He hopes he's not sweating too much.</p><p>They get cotton candy, pink and blue, and Shuichi blushes when Kaede steals a bit of his and offers him a bit of hers.</p><p>The evening fades into night, and they stop by one of the attractions for goldfish scooping. Kaede's paper scooper tears after the second fish, but Shuichi realizes he has quite the calm hand for catching the fish. Black and orange with big eyes, the goldfish make their way into his little glass bowl one after another until his scooper tears too.</p><p>There are different prizes - keeping the captured fish or trading them for another prize. Neither of them have an aquarium, so Shuichi trades his fish for a beautiful necklace with a koi attached.</p><p>"Here."</p><p>Kaede stops in front of the stand, tilting her head. "Huh?"</p><p>"It's for you." Shuichi opens the necklace. "Let me put it on for you."</p><p>Kaede gapes for a second before she turns, bowing a little so Shuichi can close the clasp of the necklace around her neck. She turns back around, her painted pink nails holding the little koi figure.</p><p>"It's lovely", she whispers. She looks at Shuichi, before quickly looking the other way. "Look! The fireworks are about to start!"</p><p>Before Shuichi has any chance to sort his thoughts, Kaede grabs his wrist and drags him along. But the street is even more crowded than before and they are late, Kaede tries to make her way through the countless other visitors to no avail.</p><p>"We won't see a lot from here", she laments with a sigh, drooping her shoulders in defeat. </p><p>"I might know a place", Shuichi says, "My uncle and me go there to watch shooting stars often. It should be the perfect view."</p><p>Kaede beams and nods. "Lead the way!"</p><p>It's a bit to go. Shuichi goes ahead, and Kaede power walks next to him, faster and faster until they're running, their footsteps echoing on the street and her necklace bouncing, reflecting the streetlights. </p><p>Kaede giggles and throws her arms around Shuichi's right arm, holding on tight, and Shuichi thinks the air is especially clean today. He's never felt so alive as tonight.</p><p>They reach the bridge that leads over the river next to the festival. Shuichi takes the stairs and then points Kaede up to something like a watchpoint. It was <em>supposed</em> to be one, anyway, but they never finished building it.</p><p>Kaede steps towards the railing, wrapping her hands around it and raises her chin up. The night breeze softly brushes through the stray strands of hair standing out of her bun, loosened from running perhaps, and when she turns to look at Shuichi, her face is the softest expression he could imagine.</p><p>She looks absolutely otherworldly, like an angel from another universe entirely, her bun faintly looking like a halo in the dim light up here, and Shuichi almost thinks there's no way she's real, that they're standing here under the stars and the universe where they are so insignificant.</p><p>But right now, Shuichi sees the entire universe right in front of him.</p><p>His heart thunders in his chest, angrily trying to push him to say what he always knew. "Kaede..."</p><p>"Look, it's starting!"</p><p>Kaede leans up to her toes and points at the sky, where the first rockets start to explode in red and blue. Shuichi smiles and joins her, and Kaede playfully bumps her shoulder against his, before she starts watching the fireworks again.</p><p>"Look! You were right! This place is perfect. Look how beautiful it is!"</p><p>And she's watching the sea of green and blue merge and slowly glow out in the sky, but all Shuichi sees are the tiny reflections in her purple eyes that look like the stars and the galaxy all in one.</p><p>"Yeah", he says breathlessly, unable to take his eyes off her, "It really is."</p><p>Her lips are slightly parted as she watches in awe, eyes wide and her hand stretched to the sky like she could grasp the stars.</p><p>The fireworks die down quickly - it's only a small festival, despite the size of it for this city, nothing as big as New Years. Kaede sighs contently and turns to look at Shuichi, realizing he's been staring.</p><p>"Shuichi, you didn't even watch! Jeez..."</p><p>She crosses her arms and pouts, puffing out her cheeks that look a little rosy. Probably from the coolness of the progressing night.</p><p>"I watched!", he argues, and it's not really a lie. He did look at the reflection in her eyes.</p><p>And seeing her like this, her lip trembling to smother a dawning smile, Shuichi realizes that he never wants to be without her. That he wants to spend those hours together forever, laughing and having fun, holding hands and watching the stars.</p><p> </p><p>"Shuichi?"</p><p> </p><p>Waking up next to her with her hair spread over the pillow like wings, making breakfast together. Living together.</p><p> </p><p>"Shuichi, what's wrong?"</p><p> </p><p>Shuichi blinks. Kaede looks worried, a frown tugging her face. Her hands are on Shuichi's shoulders now, he hasn't even realized she moved.</p><p>"Ah, sorry. I..." What is he even supposed to say? <em>Realized I love you?</em> It sounds stupid even in his head, but thinking about it...</p><p>It's been so clear, all this time. What she means to him. Because she's the sun reflecting her light at him to hover above the earth in the dark, taking in her light as if it's the only thing keeping him alive.</p><p>Shuichi hates festivals, and yet, he hasn't felt the tight pressure in his chest or the tidal waves of a panic attack he usually feels in large crowds.</p><p>Because all of that fades away when he's with her, and he wants to stay right here and freeze time and make this night last forever--</p><p> </p><p>"Can I kiss you?", Kaede asks. </p><p> </p><p>There's a loud noise inside his head. He's looking back at deep, dark purple eyes that only reflect the orange light of the street lamp a little further away.</p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p>Kaede giggles, pulling a hand away to ball it in front of her mouth.</p><p>"You don't have to. But I feel like kissing you."</p><p>"W-why...?"</p><p>Kaede gifts him another one of her smiles. It's a softer smile, a lovestruck one when she takes her other hand off his shoulders to take his hands with both of hers instead, interlacing their fingers.</p><p>"Don't you know?"</p><p>"No... I mean yes! I-I mean, ah... Maybe?"</p><p>She blinks, slowly. Shuichi feels like his body is on fire, the looming coldness of nightfall forgotten.</p><p>"Close your eyes", she whispers, and Shuichi awkwardly presses his eyes shut.</p><p>A heartbeat passes, then two.</p><p>For a horrible moment, he thinks she might have changed her mind or never meant it seriously and he's making a fool of himself, but then he remembers Kaede isn't someone to play horrible pranks on him.</p><p>She's not like that.</p><p>She's the truth. She's kindness.</p><p>She's his entire world. </p><p>More than he deserves. </p><p>And then there's touch against his lips - soft, warm, the faint scent of strawberry lip gloss. Shy brushes of another pair of lips against his, and he can't stop his breath from stuttering.</p><p>Kaede leans in more, her hands slipping his, but her arms wrap around Shuichi's neck, pulling him in more.</p><p>He relaxes into her embrace, shyly returning the kiss, mirroring her movements. It's the first time he's been kissed, it's the first time he's ever been in love - the first time he's been loved by someone else. He hopes he's not doing it too wrong. </p><p>When she pulls away to catch her breath, she presses her forehead against his and holds him so close, he can feel her heartbeat flutter against his own chest.</p><p>"I wasn't sure... if you felt the same way about me", she whispers, brushing her nose against Shuichi's.</p><p>"I... I always have", he returns, and he knows it's true. He didn't dare to dream so high, because she's everything and he's just Shuichi.</p><p>"But <em>you are</em> everything", she mumbles, and he balks.</p><p>Did she just guess his thoughts?!</p><p>"Kaede..."</p><p>"I'm in love with you, Shuichi Saihara." She leans back, her arms still around his neck, smiling at him with a little spark of challenge. "I won't let your anxious mind interpret this any other way."</p><p>"You know me too well..."</p><p>"I'm glad I do. I'm glad you know me just as well."</p><p>Shuichi chuckles, closes his eyes. Can't believe what's happening.</p><p>A bang briefly startles him, and when they tear their eyes off each other, another firework sets off into the night.</p><p>"I love you too", he whispers, just to say it out loud.</p><p>Make it real. Make it his truth. </p><p>This time, he watches the sky with her, and knows the prettiest star is right by his side. Today, and in the days yet to come. </p>
