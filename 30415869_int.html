<div class="userstuff">
<p>It made perfect sense.</p><p>Yet, unjp_gn_89533615_prc couldn't understand it.</p><p>It had started a few weeks ago. unjp_gn_57097099_prc had told him, unjp_gn_70112689_prc, and unjp_gn_34908732_prc that he was going to be away for a week or so. The three of them tried questioning him on where or why he was going, but the astronaut in training somehow managed to always avoid the questions.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc supposed it wasn't too big of a deal. unjp_gn_57097099_prc would text them sometimes during the time he was gone, so it wasn't as if anything bad were happening. (He was just glad it was during their break- He'd probably have been the one tasked with helping unjp_gn_57097099_prc catch up, which wouldn't have been fun.)</p><p>The peculiar part comes next. Just a few hours ago, unjp_gn_89533615_prc had been invited by unjp_gn_70112689_prc to join her and unjp_gn_34908732_prc at their favorite hangout spot- the unjp_preserve_59290519_prc not too far from his house. That lead him to where he was now, chatting with the two girls on a pleasant day at the start of the month, when the doors suddenly busted open, instantly catching the three's attention.</p><p>"I knew you guys would be here!" The familiar voice at the door made the three smile at varying degrees. They were all very happy about unjp_gn_57097099_prc's return- some of them were just more expressive than others- such as unjp_gn_70112689_prc, who had suddenly got up from her seat, running up to unjp_gn_57097099_prc and jumping to hug him. unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_34908732_prc could do nothing but watch intently as unjp_gn_57097099_prc caught her with ease, spinning her around and laughing alongside her.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc spared a glance at unjp_gn_34908732_prc. She was holding her drink to her mouth, knuckles white around the glass as she shook slightly. unjp_gn_34908732_prc looked as if she had murder on her mind, which instantly made unjp_gn_89533615_prc whip his head back to unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc.</p><p>"I missed you!" unjp_gn_70112689_prc cooed. unjp_gn_89533615_prc had never seen such a pretty smile before. It made his heart jitter.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc nuzzled his head into the crook of her neck. "I'm sorry, babe," He murmured, loud enough for unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_34908732_prc to hear.</p><p>
<em>...Babe?</em>
</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc felt his heart sink to his stomach.</p><p>Since when were unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc dating?</p><p>He swallowed down the sudden sorrow in his stomach, smiling shakily as the two approached the table. "Welcome back, unjp_sn_57097099_prc..." unjp_gn_89533615_prc was surprised he was able to say anything at all due to how choked up he felt. Even though they were standing next to each other now, he felt as if the image of unjp_gn_57097099_prc hoisting unjp_gn_70112689_prc up into the air would forever be burned into his head.</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc wasn't having any of it, however. "Since when were you two dating?" Her voice was sharp and demanding- enough to make unjp_gn_89533615_prc flinch slightly. (That wasn't saying much, however, as unjp_gn_89533615_prc was a very jumpy person who tended to flinch a lot.)</p><p>"Ah, um," unjp_gn_70112689_prc's cheeks tinted pink as she looked down at her shoes briefly. "For a while now, actually..." She admitted.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc nodded his head, pulling unjp_gn_70112689_prc to his side. "Sorry guys, but we agreed to keep it secret so it wouldn't make things awkward," He said, patting unjp_gn_70112689_prc's hair.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc gave a side hug to unjp_gn_57097099_prc, nuzzling her face into his side. "But I missed him so much I just couldn't help myself!"</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's mood soured further.</p><p>"I missed you too, baby," unjp_gn_57097099_prc planted a kiss on the top of unjp_gn_70112689_prc's head, making her giggle slightly.</p><p>Apparently, unjp_gn_34908732_prc's mood had been spoiled as well. She shot up from the table without a word, briskly walking past unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc and out of the diner.</p><p>"What the-?" unjp_gn_57097099_prc stared at the door with a confused expression.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc looked guilty. "I think I messed up..." She whimpered.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc opened his mouth to give unjp_gn_70112689_prc some comforting words, but unjp_gn_57097099_prc had beat him to the punch. "It's alright babe, I know you didn't mean to upset her."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc bit his tongue, helpless to the feelings of envy festering inside of him. He rose up from his seat, catching the attention of unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc. "I'll look for her." He pulled out his wallet, placing a few yen on the table for his and unjp_gn_34908732_prc's drinks.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc shook her head. "No, I should-"</p><p>"It's alright." unjp_gn_89533615_prc interjected. "Just..." He paused for a moment, gambogeish grey eyes landing on their intertwined hands. "Have fun, you two."</p><p>He didn't spare them another glance as he hastily made his way out of the diner. He pulled his phone out as he walked at a brisk pace, calling unjp_gn_34908732_prc's phone and hoping she'd pick up.</p><p>She hadn't. He could've bet on that. unjp_gn_89533615_prc knows he promised unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc he'd look for unjp_gn_34908732_prc, but the tears stinging in the back of his eyes and the bile he felt rising up in his throat had sent him running back home.</p><p>It made perfect sense. unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc were always the cheery ones of the group- they complimented each other nicely, personality wise and appearance wise. (Leave it to them to make purple and pink look so good.)</p><p>Yet, unjp_gn_89533615_prc still couldn't understand it. He rushed into his house, ignoring whatever his Uncle had said to him as he kicked his shoes off and made his way into his room. No matter what angle he looked at it from, he couldn't wrap his head around it.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc turned on his bedroom light.</p><p>"unjp_sn_89533615_prc."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc screamed, jumping up so high he banged his head onto his doorframe.</p><p>Sitting on his bed, arms crossed and foot burning a hole into the ground, was none other than the girl he was supposed to be looking for; unjp_sngn_34908732_prc.</p><p>"unjp_sn_34908732_prc!" unjp_gn_89533615_prc hissed, entering the room and closing the door behind him. "What are you doing here?!" He brought a hand up to his head, rubbing the small bump that formed from the impact.</p><p>"What in the hell was that?" She spat, rising up from the bed. This was the first time unjp_gn_89533615_prc had ever seen an emotion so clearly on her face- pure, unbridled anger. She stepped forward.</p><p>"What do you mean what was that?!" He asked, still shaken from the not so pleasant surprise of his friend in his room. "You know I'm jumpy! How'd you even get in here?!" He stepped backward, feeling his back against the door.</p><p>"You know damn well that's not I'm talking about!" She stepped forward. "Your dad let me in."</p><p>"Uncle," unjp_gn_89533615_prc corrected. unjp_gn_34908732_prc took another step forward, her glare deepening. "Sorry," He squeaked.</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc was now standing directly in front of unjp_gn_89533615_prc. "Answer me, unjp_sn_89533615_prc."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc had noticed that whenever she was upset or annoyed or overwhelmed with any sort of negative emotion, she tended to leave off honorifics from names. It wasn't often, but it was enough for him to pick up on. Another thing the detective had picked up on was her voice and how it wavered. It was slight, but he definitely heard it.</p><p>Now that she was standing so close to him, unjp_gn_89533615_prc could see her red eyes more clearly- they were watery.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc felt his body ease up a little, finding a strange sense of comfort in being reminded that he wasn't the only one saddened by this. "I know just as much as you know, unjp_sn_34908732_prc." He sighed, looking at unjp_gn_34908732_prc with sympathetic eyes for a second before he turned his gaze downwards.</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc grabbed unjp_gn_89533615_prc's chin, forcing him to look at her. "And you're just gonna sit there knowing damn well what you saw?!" The tiniest bit of spit flew from her mouth. unjp_gn_89533615_prc flinched, feeling it hit his cheek. With a deft wave of her hand, unjp_gn_34908732_prc wiped it off of his cheek, leaving her hand to linger against his face for a bit.</p><p>"Says the girl who stormed out of the diner!" unjp_gn_89533615_prc's voice cracked slightly as he said the only retort he could think of.</p><p>Turning the attention to unjp_gn_34908732_prc. A bad move on his part, really.</p><p>The hand on his cheek tightened. He could feel her nails against his skin.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc cowered. "Okay, okay, sorry!" He yelped. unjp_gn_34908732_prc retracted the hand from his cheek. "But what do you want me to do about it?!" His breath hitched in his throat.</p><p>"Literally anything!" unjp_gn_34908732_prc yelled.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc normally wasn't one to raise his voice, but with the jealousy swarming throughout his body combined with unjp_gn_34908732_prc's yelling, he felt himself start to shout as well. "Why are you so worked up about this?!"</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc had rose to the tips of her toes, leaning forward. "Why <em>aren't </em>you worked up about this?!" unjp_gn_34908732_prc barked. There noses were almost touching.</p><p>The two sat in silence after that. Neither of them knew what to say. unjp_gn_89533615_prc simply stared at unjp_gn_34908732_prc, and unjp_gn_34908732_prc merely stared right back.</p><p>After what felt like hours, unjp_gn_34908732_prc finally stepped away from unjp_gn_89533615_prc, taking a seat on his bed.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's shoulders had tensed up sometime during their brief argument. He let out a breath he didn't know he was holding, sliding down to a sitting position against his door.</p><p>"You're upset too, aren't you?" unjp_gn_34908732_prc's voice was back to it's usual neutral tone as she watched unjp_gn_89533615_prc lean his head against the door.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc merely nodded, staring blankly at his ceiling. "I don't think I've ever felt jealous in my life until now." He admitted as he let out a dry laugh. "I don't know why, though."</p><p>"You feel the same way about unjp_sn_70112689_prc as I do about unjp_sn_57097099_prc, that's why." The honorifics in the names were a big indicator that unjp_gn_34908732_prc had calmed down.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc thought about it for a brief moment. He thought about all the times unjp_gn_70112689_prc had been there to lift his spirits when they were down, all the times she was one of the only people he felt he could confide in, all the times she'd smile or laugh and he'd swear his heart would take flight at any second, all the times-</p><p>He nodded. "Yeah. But you saw how happy they looked. I..." He bit his lip. The stinging at the back of his eyes was more prominent. "I don't want to be the one to ruin that. Even if it hurts me."</p><p>"Then I'll do it." unjp_gn_34908732_prc crossed her arms. "I know you're smart enough to not tell anyone what I'm about to say, so I'll only say this once. I'm selfish and rotten and I've never felt this way about anyone before." She sniffled, her breath hitching in her throat. "I'm desperate and I'm more than willing to do it." She stood up, blinking away any tears that threatened to spill out of her eyes as she walked over to unjp_gn_89533615_prc. "Here's your ultimatum. Figure out what the hell's happening before I do. Now get up and get out of my way."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc didn't want to ask her what she'd do if she figured it out before he did. (He had a few ideas, though- none of which he liked.) Instead, he wasted no time in obliging to her request, hastily standing up and stepping aside. Neither of them said a word as unjp_gn_89533615_prc watched unjp_gn_34908732_prc turn down the hall and leave his house.</p><p>For a few minutes, unjp_gn_89533615_prc allowed himself to stand there and process everything that had just transpired in the past few minutes. He was hoping to have a relaxing time hanging out with unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_34908732_prc at the diner, but was instead violently launched into whatever this disaster was.</p><p>Letting out a final sigh, he made his way to the front of the house, slipping on his shoes.</p><p>It made perfect sense.</p><p>Yet, unjp_gn_89533615_prc still couldn't understand it. Actually, he didn't <em>want</em> to understand it. However, being the detective he was, unjp_gn_89533615_prc was determined to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>And he'd do it the best way he could- following his heart (which unjp_gn_70112689_prc had taught him), trusting his gut (which he learned from unjp_gn_57097099_prc), and sticking to it until the very end (something he had picked up from unjp_gn_34908732_prc).</p><p>Unfortunately for him, his gut (and his heart) had decided to take him to unjp_gn_70112689_prc's house. unjp_gn_89533615_prc could have easily waited at his own house- he could have even texted unjp_gn_70112689_prc to come back to her place because he wanted to talk to her- but instead, he waited for around a half hour, pacing around her house. (Oh how he hoped there was no one nearby who had seen him- he most definitely looked like a creep.)</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc took the time he had to himself to think various things through. He usually enjoyed talking to unjp_gn_70112689_prc, but with each step he took the anticipation had only filled him with more dread. He felt that he wasn't ready to talk to unjp_gn_70112689_prc yet (especially not after what he witnessed at the diner), but unjp_gn_34908732_prc's words rang in his head alongside the sight of unjp_gn_57097099_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc at the diner, and he knew he didn't have much of a say in the matter.</p><p>"unjp_sn_89533615_prc?" unjp_gn_89533615_prc jumped slightly, turning on his heels to face unjp_gn_70112689_prc.</p><p>"unjp_sn_70112689_prc!" unjp_gn_89533615_prc's heart was pounding wildly in his chest. Only this time, it wasn't in a good way. "Hey, um," He took a deep breath. He could do this. "I was hoping I could talk to you?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc beamed at him.</p><p>He couldn't do this.</p><p>"Of course!" She nodded her head, clasping her hands together in front of her chest. "What's up?"</p><p>"Ah, um, well," unjp_gn_89533615_prc stumbled over his words as he desperately tried to think about what to ask her.</p><p>He asked the first thing he thought of. "Why unjp_sn_57097099_prc?"</p><p>...He should've just stayed home.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc tilted her head slightly to the side in confusion. "Why unjp_sn_57097099_prc?"</p><p>It was too late to back out now. "Y-yeah, why'd you decide to date unjp_sn_57097099_prc?" He asked.</p><p>"What kind of question is that?" unjp_gn_70112689_prc asked. "You know how he is! He's so sweet and passionate- I really admired him, and I guess at some point in time I started liking him..." </p><p>She had such a big smile on her face.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's breath hitched in his throat. He felt the stinging feeling in his eyes again. "So, did you ask him out?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc shook her head. "Surprisingly enough, he asked me out..." She looked down at her shoes briefly.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc furrowed his brow. He had been around unjp_gn_70112689_prc enough to know what she did whenever she lied- one of which was looking at her shoes for a second. (No, he hadn't learned that from ogling at her. He was merely observing her like the detective he was, that's all.)</p><p>Now that he thought about it, hadn't she done that at the diner? At the time, he was too distraught to notice, but he was sure she had done so when she talked about how long her and unjp_gn_57097099_prc had been together.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc's answers were rather vague, too- something peculiar for her. The blonde could tell you the exact amount of days since an event had happened if it concerned something she was passionate about. (It embarrassed her a little once it was brought to her attention, but unjp_gn_89533615_prc thought it was cute.) Surely she'd be passionate enough about her boyfriend to tell him and unjp_gn_34908732_prc the exact date of when they got together.</p><p>Now, unjp_gn_89533615_prc was presented with the question of <em>why</em> unjp_gn_70112689_prc would lie about such trivial things. "I feel like there's something you're not telling me."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc blinked, her ahoge twitching slightly. She hesitated a moment before answering. "What do you mean?"</p><p>An ahoge twitch and a brief hesitation. He was on the right track. unjp_gn_89533615_prc decided who asked out who first was unimportant, and opted to ask about when they'd got together. "You're a very punctual person, unjp_sn_70112689_prc. Earlier, you told unjp_sn_34908732_prc and I that you two had been together "for a while" instead of giving us an actual date."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc bit her lip, grabbing her arm as a guilty look took over her expression. "We got together a month and a day ago." She answered. unjp_gn_89533615_prc didn't buy it- but this time, there wasn't any reason to not buy it. There was no tell from unjp_gn_70112689_prc that she was lying, there was no memorable event from a month ago that could prevent them from getting together, there was no reason to not believe her.</p><p>He vaguely recalls unjp_gn_70112689_prc telling him to follow his heart.</p><p>There was one reason to not believe her- his own selfish wishes. (And unjp_gn_34908732_prc's, too, he supposed.)</p><p>"unjp_sn_70112689_prc." unjp_gn_89533615_prc put a hand to her shoulder. He wasn't sure where to take the investigation next after this, but he had a genera idea. Unfortunately, he'd have to bluff to get there. "You're acting strange. Is there anything else you're not telling me?" But first, he gave her one last chance to come clean.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc didn't take it. She smiled, removing her hand from her arm and placing it on unjp_gn_89533615_prc's outstretched arm. "You know I don't like hiding stuff from you. You're my friend, unjp_sn_89533615_prc."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's heart skipped a beat, but he quickly shook his head. "I know you don't. But what if you had to?" He prompted. unjp_gn_70112689_prc's mouth opened slightly. Bingo. "You're a very selfless person, unjp_sn_70112689_prc. When I asked you to keep the reason why I wore my hat a secret, you didn't say a word about it. Even after I stopped wearing it, you still never told anyone, didn't you?" He asked. unjp_gn_70112689_prc shook her head, and he decided to present to her the conclusion he had reached. "You know something about why unjp_gn_57097099_prc left, don't you?" He asked. "You were told to keep it a secret, so you did."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc said nothing for a minute.</p><p>"Ah, you don't have to tell me what it is-" unjp_gn_89533615_prc assured. "I'm just looking to confirm whether or not you know."</p><p>After a bit of silence, she sighed, smiling slightly. "You're a detective through and through, huh?" She asked. unjp_gn_70112689_prc slid her hand up to rest on unjp_gn_89533615_prc's own hand, gently pulling it up to rest on her cheek.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's face flushed at the intimate motion, his head reeling as he watched her lean her head into his palm and his heart racing as he felt her soft cheek against his skin. He suddenly remembered that unjp_gn_70112689_prc had a boyfriend- unjp_gn_57097099_prc, too, of all people- and pulled his hand away, although a bit reluctantly. (He did <em>not </em>want to be on the receiving end of the lecture he'd get from unjp_gn_57097099_prc about how unmanly he was for putting his hands on someone else's girl.)</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc pouted slightly, and unjp_gn_89533615_prc resisted the urge to put his hand back against her cheek. "Unfortunately, I'm afraid you're wrong." She looked down at her shoes briefly. "I don't know anything about why unjp_gn_57097099_prc left."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc frowned. Despite her tell, he wanted so badly to believe unjp_gn_70112689_prc. He decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. "Okay, so maybe you don't know anything about why he left..." Perhaps it was a partial lie. But if she really didn't know why he left, then what did she know that he didn't?</p><p>It clicked in unjp_gn_89533615_prc's mind. "But you definitely knew when he was coming back, didn't you?"</p><p>"Huh?" unjp_gn_70112689_prc blinked.</p><p>"You were the one who invited unjp_sn_34908732_prc and I to the diner, the same place where unjp_sn_57097099_prc just happened to guess we'd be at." unjp_gn_89533615_prc exclaimed. "It seems too convenient to be a mere coincidence."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc awkwardly laughed. "Yep..." She admitted, nodding her head. "You got it. I should've known I wouldn't have been able to hide it from someone as smart as you."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc blushed slightly at the compliment. She was always so direct- he had known her for around a year and he'd still get as flustered as he did when they first met. A sudden thought entered his mind. "But if you knew he was coming back, couldn't you have just met him privately so you could be intimate without us finding out?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc said nothing, unable to look unjp_gn_89533615_prc in the eyes and instead looking at the ground.</p><p>The only idea unjp_gn_89533615_prc could come up with was... "Did..." Was that really it? "Did you <em>want</em> us to find out?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc nodded in a meek fashion.</p><p>"R-really?" unjp_gn_70112689_prc nodded once again. "But why?"</p><p>The silence between them was awkward, as unjp_gn_70112689_prc was unable to bring herself to answer him and unjp_gn_89533615_prc was trying to think of why she lied about wanting to keep her relationship a secret.</p><p>He wasn't able to come up with anything. unjp_gn_89533615_prc moved forward slightly, putting his hand on unjp_gn_70112689_prc's shoulder as he had earlier. "unjp_sn_70112689_prc," He brought his other hand to her chin, gingerly lifting up her head so he could look into her eyes. He noticed her gaze tremble and her lip quiver, and he wanted nothing more than to embrace her right then and there. "I need your help with this. You know you can tell me anything, okay?" She nodded. "Was it unjp_sn_57097099_prc's idea? Did he ask you to keep it a secret?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc shook her head. "There's no secrets involved in this." She bit her lip. unjp_gn_89533615_prc watched more intently than he needed to. "Well, except this one. It's not like I want to keep it a secret from you-!" She quickly added. "It's just... a little hard for me..." She trailed off, taking a lock of her blonde hair between her fingers and tucking it behind her ear.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc nodded, hesitating for a moment before pulling his hand away from her face. "Then how about we work together?" He offered, giving unjp_gn_70112689_prc his best reassuring smile. "You give me some clues, and I'll figure it out from there. Alright?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc smiled. She held his free hand with both of hers, and unjp_gn_89533615_prc felt his heartbeat start to pick up. "Thank you, unjp_sn_89533615_prc. I'm sorry for making this so hard."</p><p>"It's no trouble at all." He assured, rubbing his thumb over the back of one of her hands. "Now, can you tell me what you can?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc nodded. "unjp_sn_57097099_prc and I aren't actually dating."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's eyes widened. His eyebrows raised. His hand on her shoulder went limp. Never in a million years would he have guessed that. He most definitely wasn't complaining, though- the wave of relief that had washed over him was revitalizing. "So you pretended to be dating?"</p><p>"unjp_sn_57097099_prc and I had different reasons, but it worked out for the both of us, so we agreed to do it." unjp_gn_70112689_prc told him.</p><p>"You said there were no other secrets, right?" unjp_gn_89533615_prc asked. "You probably can't tell me why you did what you did because of your reason; but what about unjp_sn_57097099_prc's motive? Can you tell me that?"</p><p>"I tried convincing him that unjp_sn_34908732_prc had a crush on him, but he didn't believe me." unjp_gn_70112689_prc giggled slightly. "I figured jealousy would help prove it to him, and suggested that we fake date. Though, now that it's said and done, I feel really bad for all of this." The corners of her lips etched downwards into a frown.</p><p>"It's alright- there was no way you could've known it'd turn out like this." unjp_gn_89533615_prc paused before he said his next question. Perhaps he was being too hopeful, but he was curious, and it was the only thing on the forefront of his mind. "Is your reason similar to unjp_sn_57097099_prc's?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc's cheeks tinted pink. "Y-yeah..."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc's heartbeat roared in his ears. "Assuming that you came up with the entire fake dating idea yourself..." His grip on unjp_gn_70112689_prc's shoulder tightened a little. "Do you... do you feel the same way about me as I do about you?"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc lightly squeezed his hand. "That... depends on how you feel about me," Her blush had deepened.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc had pulled his hand out of unjp_gn_70112689_prc's grip, wrapping his arms around her in a tight embrace. He felt his legs tremble beneath him- and before he knew it he was sinking to the ground alongside the blonde.</p><p>"I'm so sorry if I hurt you," unjp_gn_70112689_prc mumbled against his collar. She buried her head into the crook of unjp_gn_89533615_prc's neck.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc pulled unjp_gn_70112689_prc into his lap, resting his chin against the top of her head. "It's okay. Just," He paused, tilting his head down and inhaling her scent. She smelled sweet, like flowers and berries. "Please don't do something like that again." He was full on shaking now, tears once again welling up in his eyes. Only this time, they were happy tears. "I was so scared," He admitted.</p><p>"I won't, I promise." unjp_gn_70112689_prc wrapped her arms around him, finally returning his embrace. "I- I realized what I had done too late and I thought you'd be mad at me if you found out so I couldn't bring myself to tell you that it was just some April Fool's prank gone wrong and-"</p><p>"Hey." unjp_gn_89533615_prc stopped her rambling before it worsened. He pulled her away from him in order to look in her eyes. There were tears slipping down her cheeks. He moved one hand to hold her cheek, wiping away the stray tears with his thumb. "I'm so enamored with you, I don't think I could ever be mad at you."</p><p>More tears fell from the lavender eyes unjp_gn_89533615_prc had grown to love. A smile broke out on her face. "I- I can't believe this entire time you liked me too!" She exclaimed. A small hiccup escaped from her lips. "Jeez! I'm such an idiot!"</p><p>"Don't talk about yourself like that," unjp_gn_89533615_prc kissed away the new tears that fell down her face. His heart was pounding erratically in his chest- he never thought he'd see the day where he'd actually kiss unjp_gn_70112689_prc. "You're perfect." His face flushed as he realized how cheesy that had sounded.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc laughed slightly, bringing a hand up to her face to wipe away her tears. "If I were perfect then we probably wouldn't be here right now."</p><p>"Then you're perfect to me." The arm he had around her waist pulled her closer, as the hand on her face moved up to gently stroke her blonde hair. He let out a loud sigh of relief, resting his forehead against hers. "If anything, I'm the idiot for not realizing it was fake. It is April first after all, it should've been obvious from the start."</p><p>"Hey!" unjp_gn_70112689_prc pouted. "If I'm not allowed to talk bad about myself then you're not allowed to talk bad about yourself either!"</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc chuckled. She looked so adorable when she pouted. "Alright, alright," He relented. "Although, I think we're both a bit dense for not realizing our feelings sooner."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc hummed happily, planting a kiss on unjp_gn_89533615_prc's nose. Her smile grew as she watched his face flush red. "I'm sure we weren't as bad as unjp_sn_57097099_prc and unjp_sn_34908732_prc, though."</p><p>"Yeah..." unjp_gn_89533615_prc has half convinced this entire day had been a dream- too eventful for his tastes, yet he couldn't say he wasn't happy with the end result. He pulled his head back a little bit, tilting his head slightly to the side before leaning back in.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc had reciprocated the motions, her breath hitching in her throat and her heart freezing up in anticipation for the very thing she had been wanting for almost a year now.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc suddenly pulled away. "Shit!"</p><p>A look made up of two parts concern and two parts disappointment took over unjp_gn_70112689_prc's face. "What?" It had come out a bit more rude than she had intended it to, but unjp_gn_89533615_prc didn't seem to care.</p><p>"unjp_sn_34908732_prc!" He exclaimed. "She's really mad right now- who knows what she'll do if she finds unjp_sn_57097099_prc!"</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc's face paled as she shot up from unjp_gn_89533615_prc's lap, taking a quick second to dust off her skirt. "We have to find him before she does!" She exclaimed. "I think he was heading back home when we parted ways, we should head over there!"</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc jumped up to his feet, nodding in agreement. "Let's go!" He hastily grabbed unjp_gn_70112689_prc's hand and took off with her in search of their friend.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>A lot of people stared at unjp_gn_34908732_prc as she made her way down the streets. Some cowered away once they saw her scowl, while others whispered amongst themselves. unjp_gn_34908732_prc didn't pay them any mind, however, as she kept her gaze straight forward and marched forward with purpose.</p><p>After around thirty minutes of searching, she finally caught sight of his familiar spiky hair. He was nearing his house, and there was no one else around. "unjp_sn_57097099_prc!" She shouted, running towards him.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc turned around, a confused look on his face. "Harumaki-?" He couldn't quite finish what he was saying, as unjp_gn_34908732_prc had tackled him to the ground. He huffed as he slammed into the ground, moving his hand to the back of his head to shield it before it could hit the concrete. "Woah!" He laughed slightly, grinning widely at unjp_gn_34908732_prc with his eyes closed. "Someone's excited to see me."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc placed one of her hands flat on unjp_gn_57097099_prc's chest to hold herself up, putting her legs on either side of him and straddling him. "What's up with you lately?" She asked, slamming her other hand down next to his head, prompting him to open his eyes. "You've been acting strange. Spit it out."</p><p>"Huh?" unjp_gn_57097099_prc blinked in confusion, unbothered by the intense glower on her face. "Whaddya mean?" </p><p>"First off, you didn't tell anyone where you were going for a few weeks, and now you were apparently hiding your relationship with unjp_sn_70112689_prc from unjp_sn_89533615_prc and I?!" unjp_gn_34908732_prc curled her fingers up, balling up the fabric of unjp_gn_57097099_prc's shirt in her fist. "What the hell's up with that? You're such an over-sharer, why are you being so secretive?"</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc was oblivious to the demanding (and clearly upset) tone to unjp_gn_34908732_prc's words. "Aww, you care about me that much, Harumaki? You're so cute!"</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc's cheeks flushed red from embarrassment and anger. unjp_gn_57097099_prc (unfortunately) assumed it was solely because of the former. "Shut up!" She barked. "You're avoiding my question! And don't call me cute when you have a girlfriend!"</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc sighed. "Fine, I give in. You caught me, fair and square. But, I gotta ask, do you... Ah, this is gonna sound weird... But, do you have a thing for me, Harumaki?"</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc leaned back slightly, her face reddening even more. "Quit avoiding my question and answer me already, idiot!" She yelled.</p><p>"No, really," unjp_gn_57097099_prc had a serious look on his face now. He moved his hands to hold onto unjp_gn_34908732_prc's waist. "It might not seem like it, but it's definitely related."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc's lips quivered as her brow furrowed. "I asked you first." Her voice took on a stern tone. "I'll answer your question only after you answer mine."</p><p>"Works with me!" unjp_gn_57097099_prc smiled briefly. "Alright, so, to start off, unjp_sn_70112689_prc and I were talking about whatever, when she told me that you had a thing for me." unjp_gn_34908732_prc gritted her teeth. Had unjp_gn_70112689_prc really told him that? She thought that the blonde would keep it a secret. "She also told me that she liked unjp_gn_89533615_prc, but wasn't sure if he liked her back. Long story short, one thing led to another and we agreed to fake date in order to see you and unjp_sn_89533615_prc's reactions and whether or not you actually liked us."</p><p>"Fake... Date?" unjp_gn_34908732_prc asked, the angry expression on her face vanishing into a blank one. "You guys aren't actually dating?" Her voice trailed off at the end, a twinge of sadness within her words.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc grinned. "Yep! Happy April Fool's! There's no way unjp_sn_70112689_prc and I would actually date. She's nice and all, but she's already got a thing for unjp_sn_89533615_prc. And, well, apparently you have a thing for me, right?" He asked. "It'd be pretty unmanly of me to do something like date your best friend."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc said nothing as she sat atop unjp_gn_57097099_prc, not moving.</p><p>"Harumaki?" unjp_gn_57097099_prc questioned, tilting his head slightly to the side in confusion. "You good?"</p><p>If only he knew the world of pain that was awaiting him.</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc grinded her teeth together, tugging on his shirt as she pressed down hard on him. To say she was fuming was an understatement. "What kind of sick joke is this?!" She shouted.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc flinched slightly. "Woah, sorry Harumaki,"</p><p>"Shut up!" She scolded. unjp_gn_34908732_prc was now trembling with a swarm of rage and confusion. She drew her hand back from it's place next to unjp_gn_57097099_prc's face, raising her hand up in the air and preparing to smack him hard enough to send him through the ground and back out the other side of the earth.</p><p>"Wait!" Two voices called out to unjp_gn_34908732_prc at the same time- probably unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc.</p><p>A loud, crisp smacking noise rang throughout the air. They were too late.</p><p>The two ran up, out of breath as they stood next to their friends. unjp_gn_70112689_prc let go of unjp_gn_89533615_prc's hand in order to slump forward and rest both her palms on her knees. "unjp_sn_34908732_prc-"</p><p>"You-!" In a split second, unjp_gn_34908732_prc had rose from unjp_gn_57097099_prc's limp body (did she knock him out that easily?!), blinking away the few tears that had started to form before marching towards unjp_gn_70112689_prc with a sinister glare on her face.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc stood in front of unjp_gn_70112689_prc, holding out his arms. "Wait, unjp_sn_34908732_prc, you don't have to do that! I figured out what happened!"</p><p>"Yeah, and so did I." unjp_gn_34908732_prc crossed her arms. "And it sounds exactly like something unjp_sn_70112689_prc would come up with."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc froze up. She had <em>really </em>messed up, huh? She grabbed onto her elbow, lavender eyes gazing downward.</p><p>The blonde was about to come clean, when a loud groan caught the three's attention. "It was all me, Harumaki." unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc's eyes widened. "I didn't think it was important at the time, so I didn't mention it. Sorry 'bout that." He let out a little laugh. unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc were bewildered- he was taking the blame just like that?! "Please- leave unjp_sn_70112689_prc and unjp_sn_89533615_prc out of this."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc turned to face unjp_gn_57097099_prc. "I'm definitely leaving unjp_sn_89533615_prc out of this, but I know damn well unjp_sn_70112689_prc isn't exactly innocent here."</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc shook his head, propping his elbow up behind him and leaning up. "C'mon, Harumaki." unjp_gn_70112689_prc and unjp_gn_89533615_prc caught sight of the bright red mark on his face- a perfect handprint from unjp_gn_34908732_prc. Despite that, he didn't look or sound as if he was in any pain. "Don't be like that."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc faltered slightly at the nickname, inhaling sharply as she now found herself at a loss for words. She quickly shook her head as if she was shaking away her momentary stupor, and was about to protest when unjp_gn_57097099_prc suddenly let out a horrendous cough. The force was strong enough for him to shoot upright from his spot on the floor into a full-on sitting position. Even more alarming was the fist he had raised to his face in order to cover up his mouth, and how it was now covered in fresh blood.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc gasped. "I don't mean to point fingers, but just how hard did you hit him, unjp_sn_34908732_prc?!"</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc looked just as surprised as unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc did. "Hard enough to maybe knock some sense into that thick skull of his, but not hard enough to do something like that," She shook her head, rushing back to unjp_gn_57097099_prc's side and kneeling beside him.</p><p>unjp_gn_57097099_prc groaned. "This has nothing to do with-" He let out another nasty cough, more blood getting on his fist and some dripping down his chin. "Shit!" He cursed under his breath</p><p>"I don't think this has anything to do with unjp_sn_34908732_prc," unjp_gn_89533615_prc chimed in, approaching unjp_gn_57097099_prc alongside unjp_gn_70112689_prc. "We should probably take him to the hospital."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc nodded, picking up unjp_gn_57097099_prc bridal style in one fell swoop. "Keep up!" She shouted as she ran. "I'm not going to wait for you two."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc heaved loudly as she ran alongside unjp_gn_89533615_prc. unjp_gn_34908732_prc was completely out of sight. "As a pianist, I think it's safe to say that I'm not made for all this running. It's," She wheezed out in between breaths, pausing for a second in order to catch her breath. "Kind of embarrassing."</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc shook his head. "Don't worry about it. I'm definitely not built for this either," He wasn't doing as bad as unjp_gn_70112689_prc was, especially since he was going a bit slower so he could run alongside her. Still, it wasn't saying much- he knew he'd be out of breath by the time they arrived at the hospital.</p><p>When they finally arrived, unjp_gn_34908732_prc and unjp_gn_57097099_prc were in the waiting room. "Took you long enough." unjp_gn_34908732_prc was cleaning up unjp_gn_57097099_prc's fist with some tissues as she spoke. "You two need to work out more."</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc sat down next to unjp_gn_57097099_prc, a hand over her chest. "To think that you ran," She huffed. "So much faster than us," She panted. "All while carrying unjp_sn_57097099_prc," She wheezed.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc was well enough to stand- although it didn't mean he wasn't short of breath. "It's not every day we run this much. "We ran from unjp_sn_70112689_prc's house to find you two."</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc hummed as she discarded the bloody tissues in a nearby trash can. "I suppose that makes up for it. After all, you two could be much worse." unjp_gn_70112689_prc pouted. unjp_gn_89533615_prc laughed slightly. "But you should still work out more." She added, walking back to stand next to unjp_gn_57097099_prc.</p><p>"All of us should work out together sometime," unjp_gn_57097099_prc chimed in. He sounded tired and weak- very out of character for the boy. "It'd be fun-" He coughed once again. unjp_gn_34908732_prc swiftly held up a tissue to his mouth, catching the blood that came out.</p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc and unjp_gn_70112689_prc could only cringe as they watched the white tissue suddenly turn red. "Let's focus on you getting better first," unjp_gn_89533615_prc spoke.</p><p>A pair of double doors opened, and a middle aged lady walked out. "Oh my, back so soon, unjp_sn_57097099_prc?" She asked, a disappointed look on her face. "Didn't you just get out earlier today? I knew you should've stayed longer."</p><p>"Earlier today?!" unjp_gn_70112689_prc exclaimed, too short of breath to say more.</p><p>"Was... Was that where you were the past few weeks?!" unjp_gn_89533615_prc's brow furrowed in concern.</p><p>"Oh, you didn't tell them?" The lady asked. "No wonder you only had your grandparents visit you! You should be more open with your friends!" She scolded. "Now come on, all of you," unjp_gn_57097099_prc rose up from his seat, approaching her with his friends in tow. "Oh my, what a brilliant red mark on your face. You sure you're not in here for that?"</p><p>"Yeah, I'm sure..." unjp_gn_57097099_prc awkwardly chuckled, looking between his friends. "...I have a lot of explaining to do, don't I?" He asked.</p><p>unjp_gn_34908732_prc crossed her arms. "You are <em>so</em> lucky I'm in love with you or else I'd be giving you more reasons to come to the hospital."</p><p>The lady let out a snort at unjp_gn_34908732_prc's remark as she lead the four deeper into the hospital.</p><p>"What an eventful day..." unjp_gn_89533615_prc hummed as they walked down the halls.</p><p>unjp_gn_70112689_prc nodded, taking his hand in hers. "You can say that again," She hummed, leaning her head against his shoulder. </p><p>unjp_gn_89533615_prc smiled, rubbing the back of unjp_gn_70112689_prc's hand with his thumb. </p>

I had so much fun writing this story, I knocked out like 2k+ words a day! I also had so much fun making the Wattpad/Fanfiction.net cover for this story! It's so cute! Sorry if it seems like this story has a bit more Saimatsu than Momoharu- it's my favorite DR ship and I think I got a little carried away. Thank you so much for reading :D</p><p>Contact me!!
