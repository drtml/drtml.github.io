<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi starts lying. Well, first he contradicts her lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please, Kaede,” he says. “You don’t have to lie for me anymore. You weren’t holding the receiver. I was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The first words since his self-imposed silence are to doom himself and all of their classmates along with him. Kaede opens her mouth, ready to shout out whatever excuse for why they shouldn’t believe him comes to her first.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo beats her to it. “Kukuku, is that confession?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi nods curtly. “It is… I don’t want to drag this out any longer, I…” he peers at Kaede from under the brim of his hat. He lowers it back over his eyes. “I killed Rantaro… I’m sorry everyon—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds her voice. “You’re lying! Shuichi’s lying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He won’t look at her. He’s hiding. Kaede feels desperation beginning to bubble up inside of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises an eyebrow. “About holding the receiver?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, no, not about that, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you admit to lying earlier,” Kokichi tilts his head. “You said he was <i>not</i> holding it but now you’re saying Shuichi’s telling the truth about him <i>not not</i> holding it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Tenko is confused,” the girl interjected. “Who was holding it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi doesn’t look up, but his voice rings clear across the growing noise. “I was. A-and I faked it going off in front of Kaede.” He glances to the side—not daring to meet the truth in Kaede’s eyes— and offers everyone a small, pained smile. “You guys figured me out exactly…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s killing himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, that’s wrong!” Kaede shouts. “All of this is wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi is not impolite when she calmly asks, “Kaede, you seem very confident in that, but how do you know? Please understand that we need evidence to believe you, especially since everything points towards—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He didn’t do it!” she shouts again. “And… and I know Shuichi didn’t do it because… because,” Kaede prepares to sign her own death warrant. “Because I did it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi flinches at her words, and the others’ talking turns into a white noise around them—</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “Ah! A second confession!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shouts, “I told you Shuichi didn’t do it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you believe Kaede is the culprit then?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wha—no! Of course not!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu launches into cackling. “Wow you really are as dumb as—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut the fuck up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu launches into sniveling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway, to talk about something important,” Ryoma sighs. “There can only be one killer, so one of them is lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I see, I see,” chirps Angie. “But why would one of them lie? Did God tell them to?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One of the confessions is an illusion,” Himiko offers. “If I had enough MP I could figure out which one, but…” she shrugs noncommittally.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo waves a finger. “The two of them were always close. Clearly this is a matter of one human choosing to throw away their very life for another. Truly something fascinating to behold.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, now Angie understands!” She claps. “Dying for your love! How romantic!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we’ll all die, too,” Tsumugi mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">—The words strike a chord in Kaede. This is not simply her life weighed against Shuichi’s. But even if it were… the realization hits her like an arrow straight through the heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She wants to protect everyone. She wants to protect <i>him</i>, even if it means saving him from himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why,” Kaede says, taking back the conversation with a new firmness in her voice. “I confessed. Because I wanted to save everyone.” She looks across the room towards Shuichi. She’s found her reason to die.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s shaking his head. He’s found his reason, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, please stop. They already know the truth. I manipulated you and used you as my alibi, and I’m sorry, but,” he squeezes his eyes closed. “I won’t let you take the fall for me anymore.” Then, his eyes finally meet hers. “I’m not worth it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her fists clench.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we vote for Shuichi, right?” drawls Himiko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” responds Kaede. Logic is leaving her. “He didn’t do it—he’s lying to save me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So… we vote for Kaede?” tries Gonta.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no evidence other than her own word that she did it,” says Shuichi. “And,” he takes a breath, “and she already lied once earlier… so how much can we trust her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The pit that took root in her stomach ever since Shuichi called out her lie doubles in size. She grips the podium in front of her tightly. The others are getting restless. The noise is rising, and Shuichi’s standing in front of her, serenely condemning himself to death for a crime she committed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The world is spinning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” Kaede’s voice is small, and she speaks only to him over the growing rumble. “Why are you doing this?” She wants to—needs to—hear the words straight from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone’s shouting now, and it’s only thanks to years of training her ears that she picks up his voice among the chaos. Shuichi says, “Because I’m a coward.” He pulls down his hat, but she can see the tears starting to form. “Because I can’t face this truth. Because I don’t want you to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth pulls into a tight line, and she starts shaking her head. She screams for everyone to calm the hell down and goes over exactly how she killed Rantaro. How she arranged the books, how she set-up the camera’s flash, how she dropped the shot-put through the vent, how she did it all right in front of Shuichi’s eyes. But…</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Interesting, interesting,” Kokichi smiles. “We have two ways someone could have killed Rantaro.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko’s sweating, “but how do we know which one is right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls his hat down. “I doubt whichever of them is lying is going to admit it now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So do we just,” Tsumugi wrings her hands. “Do we just have to pick one and hope?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if we’re wrong,” says Maki. “We all die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Gonta doesn’t like that idea!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko doesn’t either!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Looks like we got a fifty-fifty shot.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s the best you’re going to get!” chimes in Monokuma. “Because it’s time for the vote!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">This is bad, Kaede’s numb mind supplies. This is really, really bad. She quickly picks herself when her screen lights up. She leans to one side. Himiko votes for Shuichi. She leans to the other. Gonta’s voted for her. She knows Shuichi’s voting for himself. Kaede looks around at all of her classmates and has to wonder if it’s really going to come down to one vote.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It does.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And her classmates have just chosen Shuichi as the killer by a margin of one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They gather together to the side of their podiums, looking at the overhead screen light up with Shuichi’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pales. “No, no, no, no… this isn’t happening…” she presses her hands to her head. “This isn’t happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi is standing there with his arms crossed, smiling while on the verge of tears. “I’m sorry, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He finally reaches out to her, and she looks back at him. And Monokuma says something that absolutely shocks both of them to the core.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Welp! Looks like you guys got it right!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s world stops. Monokuma’s still talking, but she screams over him, “WHAT!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All the color has drained from Shuichi’s face. His eyes are wide and his mouth is open, desperately trying to form words, “b-but, that’s not—I—what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma huffs. “Do I need to repeat myself? I said you got it right. Rantaro Amami—The Ultimate Whatever’s—killer is the Ultimate Detective Shuichi Saihara.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s not!” Kaede shouts back. “I did it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears someone let out a strained sigh behind her. Then Maki says, “Kaede, just give it up already. Stop lying.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Miu yells. “We get that you’re sad you didn’t get to fuck your boyfriend before he fucked-up Rantar—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito comes to her rescue. “Hey, shut the fuck up! If Kaede says he didn’t do it, then he didn’t do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Monokuma just said he did…” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances back at her classmates because she can’t bear to look at the way Shuichi is shaking. There’s anger and frustration and despair—and in Kokichi’s case—absolute confusion painted on their faces in equal measure. And Shuichi… Shuichi… she failed. <i>She failed</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede immediately steps in front of him, shielding him from Monokuma. “We both know he’s innocent.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the bear says. “But I do know it’s time for the punishment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She steps backwards, closer to Shuichi, pulling him behind her. “No. I won’t let you. This is wrong! This is all wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” and the quiet of Shuichi’s voice gets her attention. She whips around to face him. “This… this is for the best, right? If only… if only I get executed… this is…” there are tears openly running down his face and it’s obvious he’s completely terrified. He tries to smile at her. “This is better than what I was hoping for. This is the best possible outcome. R-right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede surges forward and pulls him into a hug. She has a lot of things she wants to say, but she finds that her voice is too chocked by her own tears to get out anything other than, “I’m sorry. I am so, so sorry. This is all my fault… this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hugs her back. “Kaede… I-I…” his hands grip her shoulders tighter, “I’m glad I got to meet you, even if…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s getting impatient, hoping around the two of them in circles. “Alright, alright, we get it. You two love each other sooooo much. But we’ve got a punishment to get to!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words click something in Kaede’s head, and her hold on Shuichi becomes iron. He stiffens. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares directly into Monokuma’s robotic red eye, and says through gritted teeth, “I. Will. Not. Let. You.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The bear puts a paw to his chin. “Oh? Are you defying your headmaster?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her answer is to pull Shuichi even closer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gasps. She knows she’s hurting him now, but it’s the only thing she can think to do to stop this. Not a muscle in her body wavers when she says: “If you want to execute him, you’ll have to kill me first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma bears his claws. “That can be arranged.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears movement behind her, and suddenly Kaito is standing in front of her, flanked by Tenko and Gonta. “You’re not gonna fucking kill anybody,” he says, slamming his fists together.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s already fallen into a battle stance. “Tenko will use her neo-Aikido to protect all her classmates… even the boys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s attempting a battle stance. “Gonta will fight, too! A gentleman uses his strength to protect his friends!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pauses. “Hmm, a five-way execution might get a bit hairy, but it sure would be a series first!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi takes a step forward. “But you don’t want that,” he says, a hand at his chin. “You don’t want to kill all of us.” A strange smile that stretches too far slides on to his face. “That’s why this is happening.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Thoughts of what the hell Kokichi’s talking about and something not-quite-right about what Monokuma said begin pushing their way into the back of Kaede’s mind. Of course, most of her thoughts are simply a loop of <i>protect Shuichi, don’t let go of Shuichi, protect Shuichi…</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens his mouth, likely to ask the questions currently being shoved out of Kaede’s immediate thoughts, when giant robots burst into the trial room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisals are barring down on them, and the Monokubs are chattering about how they’re going to enforce their father’s will. Red lights flash over them, and though none of the three assembled in front of her budge an inch, Kaede can see the sudden stiffness in Gonta’s shoulders, the sweat beading down Tenko’s back, and the vein straining in Kaito’s neck as he clenches his jaw. And something about that makes her simultaneously realize two things: none of them will back down and they will all be slaughtered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They’ll all die protecting her, just like Shuichi… Shuichi’s quite desperately struggling in her grasp now. Then he’s shouting, “S-Stop! Everyone stop!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shoves the entirety of his weight against her arms, and Kaede’s grip gives out just enough for him to stumble forward, her hands still catching on to his arms. She breathes out, “Shuichi?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t look back at her. “Everyone, stop,” he says. “It’s okay. No… no one else needs to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pivots on his heel to face him. “You’re just going to give up your life?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No! I,” he takes in a deep breath. “I just don’t want anyone to die because of me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Someone—likely Maki—says, “You mean anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi grimaces at the comment echoing through the room. “Y-yes. Anyone else,” he turns to Kaede. “Because I did it, okay? That’s… that’s the truth of this case. So, please, Kaede, please find the mastermind, and… and save everyone, okay? If anyone can do it… it’s you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He tries to smile, and says “Promise me, alright?” and Kaede’s heart breaks in two.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma leaps up. “Then it’s finally time for the punishment!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Kaede can say a word, a door she hadn’t seen before flings open, and a chain flies out past all the other students and snaps around Shuichi’s neck.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s forcibly wrenched out of her grip, the strength of which sends his hat spinning to the ground as his body is yanked down the strange hallway that seems to have suddenly burst into existence. Kaede’s feet are moving after him as soon as his hand leaves her. She sprints down the hall in a dead run, the footsteps of Kaito, Gonta, and Tenko echoing close behind her, followed by everyone else.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The screens in the courtroom spell out:</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>
<b>GAME OVER</b><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>
<b>SHUICHI SAIHARA HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY</b><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><br>
<b>TIME FOR THE PUNISHMENT</b><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In bright, neon letters. A pixilated image of Monokuma dragging him away happily appears underneath. Kaede’s own sprite appears to chase after them, tiny feet shuffling quickly along the bottom of the screen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The real Kaede doesn’t spare the mocking image a single glance. The real Kaede keeps her eyes locked on the look of terror on Shuichi’s face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He reaches a hand out to her. Kaede’s lungs are on fire as she forces her legs to move even faster.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>Detective of Love Whodunit: Shot through the Heart!</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi’s pulled into a strange circular room decorated to be reminiscent of an old manor except with see-through walls and odd statues of Monokuma dressed like cupids placed at the intersections of wall and ceiling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The chain releases him, and a final wall shoots up from the ground to seal him inside. Shuichi tries runs to the wall Kaede’s racing towards, in one last ditch attempt to reach out to her again. He doesn’t make it far. As soon as he stands, a Monokuma statue pops out of the ground behind him, armed with a revolver. Kaede makes it to the window just in time to see him scream as the bullet passes through his leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi falls to his hands and knees, and more Monokumas pop up from the floor, brandishing a pipe, a knife, a candlestick, and a wrench. They move in circles on a track around him, the ones with blunt weapons liberally smashing their chosen tools against his legs, arms, stomach, only once against his head to blur his vision with blood—anywhere that won’t be fatal. The one with the knife is slower, taking care not to inflict any wounds that could kill. A simple knife through the heart would be too easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins pounding her fists against the window, shouting for them to stop, for anyone to save him as the floor inside the room begins darkening with his blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito, Gonta, and Tenko throw themselves against the window with her. It stands strong. Shuichi’s being slowly beaten to death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Suddenly, the four statues stop all at once and sink back into the floor. A red Monokuma statue appears behind him armed with a rope. It lifts the rope, ready to wrap it around his neck when the weapon is yanked out of its hands by the strange robotic Monokub.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi’s limbs are weak and barely respond as he tries to push himself up on to his knees against the floor slick with his own blood. Behind him, the robotic Monokub has turned on the blue one, wrapping the rope around its neck and yanking on either end until his head pops off. It’s a strange sight, but it means that nothing is currently trying to kill Shuichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Part of Kaede thinks that the execution has to be over. That he somehow survived and is going to be released when she spies one of the cupid Monokuma statues beginning to move.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede screams even louder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi looks up through the blood obscuring his vision to see Kaede shouting his name. He’s staring into her eyes when one of the statues let its arrow fly straight into his chest. It stops right at the surface of his skin, and instead of piercing his heart and putting him out of his misery, he instead feels the arrowhead beginning to burn.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The moment of pure shock as to what is happening to him is quickly replaced by panic as his hands desperately scramble to pull out the arrow that is incinerating him from the inside out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Breathing gets harder and harder as his lungs become engulfed in flames, and he is in such excruciating pain that eventually the world blurs around him into darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi dies bloody, half-beaten to death and gasping for breath. His body collapses to the ground, and Monokuma announces the execution has been a tremendous success.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walls that had been keeping everyone out slowly retreat into the ground. The smell of blood and burning skin fills the air around his corpse, but Kaede rushes forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She drops to her knees and just stares at his face, twisted from the agonizing pain that was meant for her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mind goes blank, and she finds herself being restrained by Gonta, kicking and screaming and Monokuma in front of her laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She is going to kill the mastermind. <i>She is going to kill the mastermind.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one speaks to her on the elevator ride back to the school. Kaede doesn’t have any speeches about hope or carrying Shuichi’s sacrifice with them or how they all just need to believe in each other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She can barely even feel her own grief over the raw anger bubbling up inside of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks like he’s on the verge of speaking, but he remains silent and the few moments of attention that are directed towards Kaede are focused on preventing her from rushing Monokuma and receiving a spear straight through the heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede goes immediately to her room and screams as she thinks about the arrow that went through Shuichi’s heart. In the privacy of her soundproof walls, she sinks to the floor with a wordless yell.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Time passes, and her voice is hoarse and her eyes are red and her fists are bruised from when she slammed them against the window Monokuma gave her to watch Shuichi die.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The bear in question pops up in front of her. “My, my, someone seems upset.” She looks up at him from her place on the floor. “And here I thought you’d be happy, given that this trial had—oh what was it?—the best possible outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grits her teeth. “He was innocent. We both know he was innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma places a paw over his mouth. “Puhpuhpuh, you seem awfully sure about that—but what evidence do you have to prove that’s the truth?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fact that I did it!?” she shouts in the bear’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s one truth, buuuuut,” he says. “If everybody thinks something else is the truth and that the truth is a lie, who can <i>really</i> say which one’s true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “Stop trying to mess with me. I know what happened. And you—!” Kaede points a shaking finger at him. “You broke your own rules to kill Shuichi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Monokuma tilts his head to the side. “Is that what happened? Am I the one who killed him? Or did he kill himself? Or did you kill him? Or did Rantaro kill him? It’s hard to say, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said,” Kaede clenches her fists. “To stop messing with me. I was there. I killed Rantaro, and I should be the one who’s dead!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re not, are you?” he smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t respond.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really, we should both be grateful to Shuichi. It’s such a pain when the first killer gets away with it, but thanks to his sacrifice, you get to live and the game has been jumpstarted!” he nods. “Yep! I would’ve taken either of you as the first killer, and he decided to trade his life for yours!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her anger subsides only for a brief moment due to an overwhelming feeling of confusion. “Why would you have taken either of us? And-and,” she pushes herself to her feet to point down at the bear. “And why is it ‘a pain when the first killer gets away?’ Aren’t those the rules of your game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” he says turning away from her. “So many mysteries and so few answers! It’d be nice if we had a detective around here! Oh wait!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to lunge forward to wring Monokuma’s furry, robotic neck when she hears a knock at her door. She whips her head towards the sound, and Monokuma’s gone the moment she turns back. With a huff, she nearly slams her door open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s standing there. He says, “Kaede—” at roughly the same time she practically shouts, “What do you want?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s taken aback for a moment before a smile oddly enough breaks out on his face. “You’re still angry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you still going to fight Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was about to when you interrupted me,” she sighs and folds her arms. “He came by to taunt me, and there’s no Gonta in my room to stop me from punching him right in his stupid face.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’d get executed for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’d be worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s still smiling. “It would. I understand why Shuichi felt so strongly about you,” his expression changes as a seriousness begins to creep into his voice. “You’re a strong person, Kaede, and I think that if anyone can stop Monokuma, it’s you.” He pumps a fist. “But just because I’m rooting for you doesn’t mean I won’t try my hardest, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s not in the mood for optimistic speeches, but she somehow finds herself baring a tired smile. “Yeah… but did you just come here to say that? To cheer me on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” he pulls something out from behind his back. Kaede blinks as he extends Shuichi’s hat towards her. “I also wanted to give you this. I picked it up before we left the trial. I figured,” he shrugs, “you probably don’t have a lot of memories of Shuichi, but maybe having something of his, well… maybe it’d help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes the hat gently from his hand and holds it to her chest. She turns it over a few times in her hands. The anger begins to drain from her as she stares at the black fabric. Without the emotional fire that had been blazing through her, she suddenly becomes aware of the ache behind her eyes, the rawness of her throat, and the soreness of her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All she feels is exhaustion. She says, “Thank you, Kaito… I apologize for yelling at you earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t,” Kaito says. “It’s good that you’re angry. It means you still want to fight for him. And,” he looks her straight in the eyes. “I also wanted to say that I believe you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stares up at him. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe what you said at the trial,” he says. “I believe that neither you or Shuichi killed Rantaro.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels something rotten beginning to bubble up in her throat. Her eyes dart to the side, and she opens her mouth when Kaito reaches towards the hat in her hands. He plucks it from her grip and places it on to her head. “Also hats are for wearing, Kaede,” he’s grinning again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs and reaches up to adjust the hat. When it’s in place, Kaede realizes just how much of Shuichi’s vision was regularly obscured. She tilts her head up higher than before to look Kaito in the eyes. Many different things run through her mind to say, but she settles on, “Thank you, Kaito, for a lot of things, but…” her eyes dart to the ground and the brim of Shuichi’s hat blocks out Kaito completely. “Let’s talk tomorrow, alright? I’d like to be alone right now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “I understand.” He turns to leave. “Just don’t blame yourself, alright? This isn’t anybody’s fault besides Monokuma’s. Got that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede leans against her doorframe. “Got it,” she lies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods at her again, and she closes the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at herself in her bathroom mirror. Shuichi’s hat is designed for hiding behind, and she tilts her head this way and that to take in the angles of her face as they appear and are obscured again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then she sighs and simply stares at her reflection. Only one of her eyes blinks back at her. She pulls the hat down lower.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro and Shuichi’s blood is on her hands. The killing game has begun.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her fists and takes a deep breath. She says to herself, “But I’m still alive,” she stares at her one eye in the mirror. “And I won’t let anyone else die.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll save everyone, and I’ll find the mastermind. It’s a promise, Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I assume eventually someone will write a story where Shuichi dies in chapter 1 and Kaede gets to be the protagonist, and as someone who loves Shuichi, I figured it might as well be me, haha. Also Shuichi's execution is entirely too western in influence as it's based on a certain board game and being shot by a cupid. Basically, I wanted to make it as painful and drawn out as Kaede's, if not worse. The arrow at the end is also inspired by a certain spoiler-y death from RWBY.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Edit: I will be posting this again in a future chapter to keep all of these amazing fanart this fic has been lucky enough to get together, but I also wanted to put this here if you want to see Shuichi's execution drawn amazingly! http://empwnleon.tumblr.com/post/168426349832/imgur-mirror-here-w-full-resolution-images</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede purposefully wakes up early the next morning. She hasn’t seen anyone besides Kaito since the trial. The trial where, according to Monokuma, she lied and tried to get everyone executed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She places Shuichi’s hat on her head. Shuichi had been an expert at using it to hide. The thought makes Kaede’s limbs heavier and sparks a tightness around her eyes as does the sight of the small portrait of him above his door when she leaves her room. Rantaro’s peeks out from behind the staircase, and Kaede adjusts the brim of the hat. Rantaro’s portrait is blocked out completely when she leaves the room, the early morning sun shining through the glass doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She follows along the path to the main school building, noting one less Exisal humming away in the dew covered grass. She finds herself almost thankful for the robotic buzzing as without them, the only sound echoing through the empty garden would be her own footsteps and sense of guilt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It is just her inside the school, when she reaches the main building, and the sharp discomfort of complete silence the Exisals had been keeping away crashes over her like a wave.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. Her voice echoes, and the hall sighs back. This is what she wanted. She wanted to be alone. If Monokuma gets what he wants, the emptiness will soon be the norm. Kaede has spent far, far too much time puzzling over exactly what Monokuma wants.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She finally hears the noises of another living person when she pushes open the door to the cafeteria. Kirumi is placing intricately folded napkins on the long table made for sixteen when she snaps her head up to the sounds of Kaede stepping into the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes quickly dart up to Shuichi’s hat, and Kaede can’t blame her for the way she pauses, almost confused at how to respond to the sight before her. Kaede decides to fight against the awkwardness beginning to hang in the air. “Good morning, Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi blinks at her words and seems to suddenly recall her well trained politeness all at once. “Ah, good morning, Kaede, please excuse me for not saying so earlier.” She straightens her shoulders, easily folding her hands in front of her. “I was not expecting to see anyone else this early in the morning, so I am not quite setup yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede walks towards the table and peers down at Kirumi’s careful arrangements laid out in front of half the chairs. “Are you setting up for breakfast all by yourself?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” Kirumi says. Kaede opens her mouth, but Kirumi quickly cuts off any comments with, “It is really no trouble. There is no need to feel any guilt over me simply acting as any maid would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth twists in to a line, but the words that leave her are, “I see.” When she looks back to Kirumi’s face, Shuichi’s hat blocks out the taller girl’s eyes, leaving her stating her offer to Kirumi’s mouth. “Can I still help you with anything? I mean, I am up early, so I might as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “It is quite alright, Kaede, really.” She moves away from the table towards the kitchen. “Also,” she hesitates, “perhaps you should not push yourself too hard this morning, if you do not mind me saying so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually, Kirumi,” Kaede says, following her. “I would kind of prefer having something to do right now.” She tugs at the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “It’s going to be kind of… difficult to face everyone when they come in, so, ah, having an excuse to leave the room to help you bring food in and out would actually be really nice. So, you’d kind of be doing me a favor if you let me help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi nods. “I see. Very well, in that case, would you like to help me set up the tea I was preparing? It should be ready any moment now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scurries after her into the kitchen. In between setting out plates and assisting Kirumi with the finishing touches of her far too beautifully designed dishes, Kaede feels the other girl’s eyes on her. Or more specifically, on the space just above her. Kaede says to the last set of silverware she sets out, “you… don’t think it’s inappropriate that I’m wearing this, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi stutters in her own preparations. “Ah,” she says. “No, I don’t. I apologize for staring, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No, it’s fine. Besides,” she sighs, staring down at her own warped reflection in the glass plate. “I’m probably going to have a lot more attention once everyone else shows up.” Kirumi does not respond, so Kaede lets out a humorless laugh, and says more helplessly than she intended, “I mean, I deserve it, right? For… almost killing everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi moves to stand across from her on the other side of the table. “You have killed no one, Kaede,” she says. Kaede’s throat tightens. “And no one is angry at you for what happened, or at least they would be foolish to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “What do you mean?” she says to the bottom half of Kirumi’s face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our true enemy is Monokuma. Not you,” she says with a finality that keeps Kaede quiet. Something about that—about ordering her around, about Kaede’s lack of response to being ordered around—makes the other girl uncomfortable. She busies herself with straightening the silverware in front of her when she asks moments later, “When did you get Shuichi’s hat, if you don’t mind my asking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says. “Kaito gave it to me last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was very kind of him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, I guess it was,” Kaede begins to follow Kirumi back to the kitchen when the other girl seems satisfied with the arrangement of each fork. “I also guess that’s at least one other person who doesn’t hate me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi shakes her head as she places her hand to push the door open. “No one hates you, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind them, the doors to the cafeteria open, and Kokichi strides in, hands folded behind his head. His eyes fall on Kaede, and the careless smile he had been wearing moments ago falls right off his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi says, “Good morning, Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quickly parrots after her, “Morning, Kokichi. You’re, ah, up early.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pulls out a chair at the table, saying, “Morning, Kirumi, Kaede,” his smile has all the warmth of a blizzard when he says, “Shuichi’s hat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely resists flinching. Kirumi sounds so faraway when she speaks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kirumi reprimands. “If you have a problem you’d like to speak with Kaede about, you should discuss it with her like an adult rather than making snide remarks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi,” he places his elbows on the table and rests his chin on folded fingers. “All I did was say good morning to everyone here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay, Kirumi,” Kaede says, stepping between them. “Really.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi gives her a questioning look that Kaede knows she doesn’t have the answer to.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shoots them a beaming smile. “Really, Kirumi. I was just complimenting Kaede on her trophy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words hit her like a freight train.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors to the cafeteria open again, and Angie leads Gonta and Kiibo into the room easily between the grinning Kokichi and the open mouthed girls. “Good morning, everyone!” Angie says, waving her hands in a half circle over her head. “God says it will be a beautiful day!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo does not register the atmosphere either, as he turns to each of them in turn, saying “Good morning, Kokichi. Good morning Kirumi. Good morning,” his eyes fall on Shuichi’s hat, and to his credit he only stutters for a moment when he finishes with, “A-Kaede. Yes. Good morning, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head in an attempt to rid herself of Kokichi’s earlier comment. Having to explain why she was gaping at the small boy would be the worst possible outcome. “Good morning, Kiibo,” she gives him a strained smile. She presses on with the small talk, taking care to block out Kokichi with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “How are you this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am good,” he says. “Thank you for asking. Ah,” he turns to Gonta. “Gonta said he founds something interesting in the garden.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, did you?” she turns to him. Part of her decides that Kokichi does not exist if she can’t see him. “Did you, ah, finally find some bugs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s looking at Shuichi’s hat and shakes himself at the sound of Kaede’s voice being directed towards him. “A-ah, no, sadly. But when Gonta was looking, he found something else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yeah?” Kokichi leans his chair back on two legs. “What you find? Another hopeless secret tunnel?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no,” he says. “It was not a tunnel. It was—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi clears her throat. “Gonta, I hope you do not mind me interrupting, but perhaps this would be information best to share when everyone is here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-oh, yes,” he says quickly. “Kirumi is right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmmm,” Angie hums, waltzing over to a chair. “Yeah, God thinks that’s best, too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, then God is right, as well,” he quickly amends. “Also,” he turns to Kaede. “Kaede, um, Gonta does not know if you noticed, but you are wearing—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, she knows,” Kokichi says, rocking back and forth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks back and forth between them, seeming to be the first of the arrivals to pick up the tension in the air. Kaede says, “It’s fine Gonta.” She pulls it down lower over her eyes. “It might be a bit strange, but…” she isn’t sure how she wants to finish that statement. Bile rises in her throat, sick, and sour, and part of Kaede wants—prays—for them to react the same way Kokichi did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo supplies, “if it helps you feel better, then I see no problem with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yep, yep,” Angie says. “God says that if Kaede wants to, she should wear anything she wants that reminds her of Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely suppress the second flinch to overtake her that morning. She turns her face away, not even Shuichi’s hat protecting her from the barrage of trying too hard to understand stares mixed with Kokichi’s cold gaze. “I-I think I’ll stick with just the hat, but thanks everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta thinks it looks nice on Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do as well,” says Kirumi behind her, placing a supportive hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi snorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors practically fling open again, and Kaede is beginning to wonder if Kokichi had somehow managed to figure out the exact timing of their classmates’ entrances beforehand to avoid any of Kirumi’s scolding for his cutting remarks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Like clockwork, Kirumi opens her mouth, and Kaito barrages into the cafeteria, seemingly in the middle of an argument with Miu. Ryoma wanders in past them, not sparing the two paused in the doorframe a second glance. Korekiyo follows him, eyes trained on the glob of spit that flies from Miu’s mouth and onto Kaito’s shirt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito explodes, and Miu begins quivering. Ryoma takes a seat without a word to anyone other than a mumbled morning back to Gonta when the other boy greets him with too much good-natured cheer for anyone to ignore without a guilty conscience. He stares up at Kaede and Kirumi huddled together by the kitchen door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches his round eyes slowly move up to Shuichi’s hat and then back down to her one visible eye. He comes to some silent conclusion and nods at her. “Morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods back, voice audible only to him over the racket happening in the doorway. “Morning, Ryoma.” Kiibo seems to have been pulled into the argument at the door, and Angie has jumped up from her seat to dance around the forming group.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi chooses to ignore the commotion in favor of smiling down at him as well. “Good morning, Ryoma. Would you like tea or coffee this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo has now taken a seat beside him, and his unnerving gaze roves over Kaede. Ryoma doesn’t need to glance behind him to recognize what’s making her squirm. “Coffee,” he says quickly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’ll get it,” Kaede volunteers, shooting both Ryoma and Kirumi a grateful look as she hurries to hide back in the kitchen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door swings shut behind her, muffling the growing voices of her assembling classmates greeting each other and laughing and just <i>talking</i>. This is what she wanted. Everyone’s happy. Almost everyone is on her side. The thought makes her stomach churn. She shuffles over to the kitchen sink and splashes her too warm face with water. There is a loud swell in the conversation outside, and Kaede hears the sound of the cafeteria doors being slammed open and swinging closed again over the running faucet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She should probably see what the commotion is about. She should probably bring Ryoma his coffee. She should probably stop wishing everyone would just simply hate her as much as she hates herself. Kaede looks at her one eye reflected in the surface of Kirumi’s sparklingly polished countertops. Shuichi hasn’t even been dead a full day. Laughter carries through the doors. Someone must have told a funny joke.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head and moves to busy herself with coffee mugs when Kirumi reenters the kitchen, a particularly vulgar jab from Miu floating through the doors after her. Kirumi says, “Miu, Korekiyo, and Tsumugi would also like coffee.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi is politely pretending Kaede wasn’t just wallowing in self-pity a moment ago, so she replies as nonchalantly as she can, “Tsumugi came by?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She did,” Kirumi says. “As did Tenko and Himiko.” She begins pouring coffee into the cups Kaede sets out in a neat row before her. “We are still waiting on Maki, and Kaito left to go find you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks up at her. “But I’m right here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I attempted to tell him that,” Kirumi says evenly. “But he left before I—or anyone else—<br>
could finish explaining.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks to herself that the phrase ‘Kaede is in the kitchen’ is not a particularly long explanation, but then again, she also thinks that Kaito probably did not wait a particularly long time. She says, “Well, ah, did he mention what he wanted to see me about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi balances three of the mugs on a tray, and Kaede takes the handles of the other two. “He didn’t say anything specific, but I believe that he is likely worried about you.” She walks to the door, beginning to push it open with her shoulder. Kaede follows behind. “I trust he is well intentioned, so at least his heart is in the right place. It’d be nice if it was in a more patient place, but that is a conversation for another time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods along, finding herself smiling again at the thought of Kaito haphazardly running around the school so he can shout words of encouragement at her. She thinks there are definitely people on her side—she murdered two people and they’re on her side in a heartbeat—and she enters the cafeteria, half-hiding behind Kirumi’s skirts when she places coffee mugs in front of Ryoma and Tsumugi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks up at her. “Ah, Kaede, Kaito was looking for,” she spies Shuichi’s hat. “Ah, um, Kaito was looking for you earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I heard.” She takes a deep breath and prepares to finally attempt to break the tension swarming over her appearance. “Hey, Tsumugi,” she smiles, sitting next to the other girl. “Can you wear other people’s hats without breaking out, or does that count as cosplaying?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She seems taken aback at the question, then furrows her brow in thought. “Ah, well, just a hat would probably be fine—although I’ve never really found a hat that looks good on me, to be honest.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m sure that’s not true,” Kaede says. “Oh, but what about jackets? Like imagine if you were on a date with someone, and it’s really cold so they put their jacket around you? What happens then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stifles her laugh with a hand. “Ah, Kaede, you’re making me sad! I’ve never had that happen before.” She gasps. “Oh, but I sure hope I wouldn’t—breaking out in hives would simply ruin the moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles back at the other girl. With the protection of Shuichi’s hat, she carefully examines how her classmates have reacted to her sudden reappearance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki slipped silently into the cafeteria at some point during her brief conversation with Tsumugi, and appears to now be curtly answering Kirumi’s questions about her preferred breakfast. Ryoma is calmly sipping his coffee, listening to a story Korekiyo is telling specifically to him and Kiibo with Miu not so discreetly listening in from behind the robot. Angie chatters away to an enthusiastic Gonta and a half-asleep Himiko, Tenko watching protectively over the latter and occasionally cooing at her when she takes a bite of her breakfast.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She notices that Kokichi seems to be by himself, despite sitting near the center of the table. Her eyes wander over everyone, all of them too wrapped up in their own conversations to notice her staring. But Kaede looks at Kokichi, and Kokichi looks straight back at her. He grins and gives her an odd wave from his island of isolation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns away. Tsumugi—who did just observe her entire staring contest—appears to be on the edge of saying something, when Kaito suddenly bursts through the doors. He’s out of breath, and shouts “Guys, I searched everywhere, and I couldn’t find Kaede! I think—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m right here, Kaito,” she says standing. Everyone turns to her. “I was, ah, just in the kitchen helping Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He lets out a sigh of relief. “You fucking scared me with that disappearing act. Don’t do that shit again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko squawks, “Kaede did nothing wrong. It’s your own fault that you ran around the entire school. Just like a dumb boy not to listen to anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, I just really wanted to find her, okay?” he collapses into the chair next to Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, before she seems to notice Kaede for the first time. “Kaede,” she says, anger draining out of her voice. “How are you feeling this morning? It is alright if you need more time after yesterday—in fact, Tenko can escort you back to your room to rest, if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no,” she shakes her head. “That’s kind of you to offer, but it’s really okay. In fact,” she lets out a breath, and attempts to direct her gaze to everyone. “I wanted to apologize for what happened at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is no need,” Tenko says with a sharp nod.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Maki says. “She did try and kill us all. Did you already forget that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko snaps her head to the other girl. “Tenko did not forget. And Tenko also does not think that was ever Kaede’s intention. She said she wanted to protect everyone, and Tenko believes her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede remembers Tenko trying to shield her from Monokuma alongside Gonta and Kaito, but still finds herself taken aback by her words. “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko covers her ear closest to Tenko with her hands. “You’re being so loud,” she mumbles. “I can barely take a nap on this nice, soft table.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah—! Tenko is sorry, Himiko,” she quickly says. “She just really thinks that everyone should still listen to Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “I do, too. In fact,” he pumps his fists. “I don’t think she or Shuichi killed Rantaro.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a withering look. “That doesn’t make any sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kiibo says suddenly. “Do you think the entire thing was planned out by Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “I’m starting to. We never really got a full explanation of why everything happened—” Kaede’s throat tightens “—so chances are that fucking bear had something to do with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, oh, oh,” Angie chants. “That reminds Angie of something she wanted to ask. So, after Shuichi killed Rantaro, why didn’t he claim first prize? Angie’s tried asking God, but he must be taking a nap right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How astute of you, Angie,” says Korekiyo. “I was thinking about that myself last night as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls Shuichi’s hat down over her eyes as discreetly as she can. Her guilt bubbles up in her stomach, and she finds herself in the mood to do anything other than eat breakfast. She finds herself in the mood to bolt straight from the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his own hat. “Makes a strange situation stranger, doesn’t it? Guess we’ll never know now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Kokichi says cheerfully. “Shuichi and Rantaro both took their secrets to the grave.” He puffs out his cheeks. “So rude of them. Buuut,” he shoots Kaede a smile. “If Shuichi were to have told anyone anything before the trial, who would he have told?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, Bakamatsu,” Miu says, leaning back in her chair. “Shyhara ever say anything weird before he kicked it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s fists clench. Her voice is tight when she says, “No, he didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi clears her throat. “If I may interject, I do recall speaking with him and Kaede during the investigation about first prize. He, ah,” she gives Kaede a painfully sympathetic look. “He speculated over the killer’s reasons for not claiming first prize, and suggested that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut. She isn’t sure who this looks worse for—Shuichi or herself. Kirumi’s voice drops a few decibels when she says, “he suggested the idea that the killer forced a trial because they wanted to kill everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The silence that falls over the once vibrantly alive table is deafening. Kaede doesn’t dare look up from the sight of her clenched fists in her lap. Regret washes over her anew. If she had claimed first prize, if she had argued against him better, if she hadn’t dropped the damn shot put.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slams both hands on the table. “What the hell are you all doing?” He shouts. “You were all fucking there! You all fucking saw him let himself get executed to save our sorry asses, and now you’re really going to sit here and think he was some kind of fucking psychopath?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right!” Gonta stutters. “Gonta remembers that Shuichi confessed, too, which does not make sense if he wanted to hurt us. So Gonta does not believe that he was that kind of person!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If anything,” Kiibo adds. “Shuichi’s actions support Kaito’s theory that Monokuma was somehow involved, yes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki shakes her head. “You’re all over thinking it because you don’t want to admit you were tricked.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We were not tricked!” Tenko says. “Shuichi may have been a boy, but Tenko could tell he was still a good person and that he cared about all of us,” she looks to Kaede. “Especially Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But in the end, he still murdered someone and still put us all in a position to die,” Kokichi says easily. “Man, this game’s gonna be no fun at all if you guys sympathize with murderers this easily.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He wasn’t a murderer!” Kaede shouts before she can stop herself. Everyone turns to her. “He… he didn’t murder anyone.” She tugs down the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “That’s not what happened.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi speaks up, “So what did happen, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns her head away, biting the inside of her cheek and does not say another word.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi comes to her rescue one again. Addressing Gonta, she says, “This is likely unrelated, but I believe Gonta had information he wanted to share with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right!” Gonta perks up. “Gonta was looking for bugs this morning and found something strange in the grass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone hesitantly turns to Gonta. Everyone but Kokichi, whose cold gaze remains fixed on Kaede, and Kaede, herself, who pulls the brim of Shuichi’s hat down as far as she can.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “Oh, what was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was this stone slab in the grass,” he says. “And Gonta noticed that there were letters on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Letters?” Miu asks. “Did they spell out anything, big dick?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems confused at her nickname, but continues, “Not that Gonta could tell, but,” he deflates. “Gonta is not that smart. Maybe someone else should look at it later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” Kokichi says, finally turning away from Kaede. “This is a good find. Looks like you are useful for something after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, it is very rude to—” Kirumi begins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you!” Gonta cheers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi blinks before simply shaking her head. Kaito says, “Right, so we’ve got a sabotaged trial and strange letters. Where do we go from here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pops out of the ground. “That sounds like my cue!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rounds on him. “Oi, you got a lot of fucking nerve showing your face here after—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now, now, is that anyway to talk to your headmaster?” he says. “Especially when he comes baring gifts?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Gifts?” An anger she had forgotten suddenly surges through her at seeing the bear’s face. “We don’t want any-any,” she waves her hands vaguely, “any <i>fucking</i> gifts from the likes of you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-yeah!” Kaito agrees, barely suppressing his surprise at Kaede’s outburst. “It’s just another one of your fucking motives again, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope, nope, nope!” Monokuma chants. “Wrong like usual. Hopefully my adorable children will get here soon to show off my fabulous presents!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his words, the four remaining Monokubs pop up, three of them awkwardly shuffled to one side away from the robotic one. Monotarou says, “U-uh, here we are, Dad. And we, uh, we got those presents right here!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, good, good,” Monokuma says, seeming not to notice the tension between his ‘children,’ “Now our school has many mysteries and much more to explore! After every trial, a little more of it will be magically revealed. Puhuhuh, that’s just another wonderful reason to look forward to trials, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands, starting towards the bear, when the robotic Monokub thrusts four strange objects in her face. “THESE-ARE-FOR-YOU,” it says, every word stilted. “PLEASE-EXPLORE-AND-GET-ALONG-WITH-ALL-YOUR-FRIENDS.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As soon as the objects are piled in her hands, the robot disappears. The other three Monokubs exchange worried glances between each other before sinking back into the floor themselves.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “So are we supposed to just wander around and figure out where these go?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Monokuma says. “Now go, explore and be ultimate detectives!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He vanishes as Kaede takes an aggressive step toward him again. “Coward,” she mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stands, and leans towards her to get a better view of the objects cradled in her hands. “So should we split up and look around or something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi approaches. “That would likely be best. There are fourteen of us and four objects. I believe it would make the most sense for us to divide into two groups of three and four.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta,” Kokichi says. “You and me should be together, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems startled. “You want to work with Gonta?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I do,” he says. “You found those letters in the grass all by yourself, after all. I want to know what other useful things you can do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-oh, thank you, Kokichi,” he says. “Gonta will try his best to not let you down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie will come, too,” she says. “In case anything bad happens, God says that Gonta can use his body to protect Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s shock, Gonta appears undisturbed by this line of reasoning. “That is correct! Gonta will do his very best to protect all his classmates!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns to Kaede and says, “You and me together, right Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks up at him. “Ah, sure, if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shoots to her feet. “Kaede, you do not have to go with an awful boy if you do not want to. If he is forcing you to do anything, let Tenko know, and she will use her Neo-Aikido to protect you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s alright, Tenko,” Kaede says before Kaito can shout back at her. “There’s actually something I want to talk to Kaito about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “Okay, but remember that you can always join Tenko and Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks up from the table. “Huh, we’re going together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says. “It is best if Himiko stays with Tenko so she can protect her from any dangers Monokuma might have waiting for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu suddenly stands up, knocking her chair to the floor. “I-is there really danger? A-all of you v-virgins keep talking about this being dangerous.” She hurries over to Tenko. “I-I’m coming—I mean,” she coughs, “The great archangel Miu has decided to grace you with her presence.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko raises her eyebrows. “Alright… Tenko’s group has three people… Kiibo, would you like to come, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The robot blinks. “Me?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, Tenko has some questions she wants to ask you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s face is a mixture of confusion and absolute delight that he is being included. “O-okay! I will do my best to help with the exploration!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Cool. Oi, Kirumi, Maki. You wanna come with me and Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face darkens. “I’d rather choke on glass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede flinches. Kirumi coughs. “I would be happy to, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo speaks before Kaito can properly process Maki’s response. “So then the final group will be myself, Tsumugi, Ryoma, and Maki.” He gives her a long look. “If she wants to that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t,” Maki stands, and makes her way out of the cafeteria alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “I’m gonna talk to her later. But now,” he turns back to Kaede. “Let’s divide these up.” He picks up the red ball, weighing it in his hand. “I have a good feeling about this one.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you ‘believe’ in it, Kaito?” Kokichi laughs. Staring up at Kaede, he asks, “Which one do I get, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at the remaining objects in her hands and blandly thinks that she has no opinion. She shuffles them around in her arms, and hands him the crank. “This one will probably need to be attached to something and then turned,” she reasons. “That should be easy with Gonta’s strength.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes!” he agrees. “Gonta would be happy to use his strength to aid in the exploration.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi turns it over a few times but doesn’t protest. “Alright. Let’s get going then. Ooh, ooh, Gonta,” he says. “Can I ride on your shoulders?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nyahaha! Angie wants to do that, too!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to defend him, when he leans down and easily picks up both of his smaller classmates. He straightens, and both of them adjust themselves to perch on each of his broad shoulders. Kokichi points a finger towards the door. “Forward, Gonta! Charge!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta takes his instructions more literally than anyone had been expecting and bolts out of the room, Angie and Kokichi clinging on to him like bull riders desperate not to be thrown off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Kaito are still staring openmouthed when Korekiyo approaches. “I must admit I’m a bit disappointed to miss out on observing whatever is going to happen between those three,” he says. “Also, unless Tenko’s group has any problems with it, I would prefer to take the ocarina.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clasps her hands. “I was hoping we would get that one. Zelda is such a classic,” she gasps. “I’ll have to put together a cosplay for her later to commemorate this!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes herself back to reality. “Ah, right,” she hands it to him. Korekiyo walks out of the room with purposeful strides, Tsumugi trailing along behind mumbling to a half-listening Ryoma about how she isn’t sure how Korekiyo is going to play an ocarina with a mask on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to Tenko. “Uh, Tenko, are you okay with taking this,” she turns it over a few times, “ticket-thing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is fine with it,” she says. “Also Tenko would like to talk to Kaede later,” she narrows her eyes at Kaito, “when you’re done with that awful boy, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He throws his hands in the air. “Why do you have a problem with me? Kiibo’s in your group, and he’s a boy!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to respond before the logic of that statement catches up with her. She furrows her brow. “Is he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko turns towards the robot in question. “Tenko actually wanted to ask Kiibo about that. Do you consider yourself to be a terrible boy, Kiibo?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo shrugs. “I don’t really have an opinion, but everyone refers to me as masculine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you just go with that?” Kaede asks, genuinely curious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” he says. “As long as I am treated like any other student, I have no preference.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu slaps his shoulder. “Kiibs, if you ever want to have anything down there, you let me know as soon as possible, got it? You’d basically be coming to the master if you get my help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wince as she tries not to think about the implications of that statement. Kiibo is bright eyed, and says, “Thank you for the offer, Miu. You will be the first to know if I do decide to pursue that route.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t, man,” advises Kaito. “Seriously, don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “Don’t listen to him,” wraps an arm around Kiibo’s shoulders and steers him out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts from foot to foot, aware she needs to run after them. She says, “Tenko has to leave, but, Kaede, do not forget that Tenko is here for you. Tenko saw the way some of those awful boys were treating you, and she will protect you in a heartbeat, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you, Tenko,” Kaede gives her a small smile. “You really believe in me, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s voice carries through the doors. “Oi, are we fucking pulling out or what?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is coming!” she calls back. She spins on her heel. “Himiko, wake up! We’re leaving now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Himiko lifts her head from the table again, a line of drool dripping from her mouth. “Is something happening?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives Kaede one last reassuring look, and hurries over to the smaller girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi says, “I believe the three of us should head out as well. Do either of you have any theories as to where to take our object?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito tosses it up and down in one hand. “Uh, isn’t there a dragon statue or something? That’d be my first guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree with that,” Kirumi says. “Well, let us make our way there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and walks alongside Kirumi, Kaito leading the three, still easily throwing the ball from one hand to the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The ball goes back and forth, and Kaede silently counts the people who trust her,. Kaito. Tenko. Kirumi. She frowns. Maybe Kiibo and Ryoma. Maybe Gonta and Tsumugi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito almost drops it and has to lunge forward to pull it to his chest. Kirumi reprimands him. Kaede stares straight ahead. Not Kokichi and Maki. Not herself. She bites her lip. Not Shuichi and Rantaro.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They reach the statue and Kaito places the ball in the dragon and the wall explodes and Kaede is pulled out of her self-loathing. Kirumi starts forward, peering down the new hallway. “It seems this goes on for quite a ways. I wonder how much larger the school is than we were initially led to believe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Seriously,” Kaito says, beginning to pick his way through the rubble left by the wall. “Oi, that reminds me, Kaede? You had your talent lab on the first floor, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She snaps her head to him. “Right. Miu’s also opened up at the same time, but nobody else’s did, I think.” She crosses her arms. “Do you think there’s a specific pattern to them or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Perhaps,” answers Kirumi. “If we assume we will eventually reach everyone’s, then I have to wonder what Rantaro’s lab is like.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs his chin in thought. “That’s actually a really good point. I have to admit I mostly brought it up because I’m excited about mine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Kirumi says. “I suppose I would like to see mine as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles at the two of them. Her thoughts wander to her talent lab. Her pianos. She hasn’t gotten to play since she woke up in the locker. She promised Shuichi she would play for him. She bites the inside of her cheek. She also promised Shuichi that she’d save him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito calls out to her, “Hey, Kaede, come look at this weird thing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s an open chest in front of them, and Kirumi’s holding what appears to be a flashlight in her gloved hands. “I have a feeling,” she begins. “That this is important. I think we should show it to everyone else before doing anything with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw,” Kaito pouts. “But it’s got an ‘on’ switch right there. Why don’t the three of us just check it out now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squints at it. Kirumi’s right—something about it does seem very, very important. The short list of people who trust her runs through her mind. A gnawing thought quietly suggests that they don’t have to share it with everyone else. She doesn’t have to believe in anyone else. She doesn’t have to live up to her own words. She doesn’t have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Kirumi’s right. I-I think we should wait.” She frowns. “We didn’t schedule a meet up point to talk about what we found, did we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kirumi sighs. “We will have to remember to schedule things better in the future. After we’re done, perhaps we should return to the gym or cafeteria and hope the others had the same idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right, right,” Kaito says. “Let’s do that after we’re done here.” Something seems to catch his attention, and he’s already running off when he shouts over his shoulder, “Let’s check out this room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Kirumi exchange a look. Kirumi shakes her head. “Well, his heart is certainly in the right place, at least.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede laughs, tiredly. “It’s nice to have someone positive around though, even if he comes on a little strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pokes his head out of the door. “C’mon, it’s really cool in here!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede calls, “We’ll be right there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room is almost startlingly elegant. Kaito throws his arms out to the sides when they enter. “Ta-da! Told you it was cool!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi’s hand is on her heart. “Oh my, everything is decorated in Victorian style, everything is so…” She smiles. “This is my lab, isn’t it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s beautiful, Kirumi,” Kaede says, staring up at the chandelier shining above. “It fits you perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” she seems taken aback. “That is very kind of you to say, Akama—Kaito, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spins on her heel. Kaito’s currently pulling at the shutters on the wall. “Look, there’s something behind here. It’s—” he shoves it open “—vacuums?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi peers inside. “And washing machines, too. How convenient—this will make cleaning the school much more efficient.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cleaning the school?’” Kaede says. “Kirumi, you really don’t need to do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s fine,” she says. “Duty before self. That is the motto of any proper maid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” Kaito says, looking up from tugging at the red curtains. “Cleaning the whole school’s a big fucking job for one person, isn’t it? We can’t ask you to do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really, it’s fine,” she insists. “I am a maid. I clean, and I serve. Just like a pianist plays the piano or an astronaut explores space.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pulls a face as he walks back over to them. “I guess. Cleaning’s no fun no matter how you look at it though, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Well maybe. But maybe astronaut training is no fun to some people either—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The hell are you talking about?” Kaito says. “Astronaut training is fucking awesome! In fact, I really need to get back into it—I’ve been slacking off these last few days.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I feel the same about my duties as a maid,” Kirumi interjects. “And Kaede likely feels the same about practicing the piano.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I guess that is true,” Kaede says. “Well, anyway, we should keep exploring, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kirumi says. “If it is not too much trouble, I would prefer to say here for a little longer to thoroughly examine my cleaning supplies. I will catch up with you soon when I am done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds good,” Kaito’s already halfway out the door. “C’mon, Kaede, don’t leave me to explore by myself!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’ll be there in a second!” she shouts as he disappears. “Uh, bye, Kirumi, and, well,” she pulls down on the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “Thank you for this morning, really.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi gives her a kind smile. “Of course, Kaede. I,” she pauses. “I understand that a lot of our classmates are still… figuring out their feelings as to what has happened, but please know that I, personally, support you in full.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi…” she says. Kaito’s shouting carries through even the closed door, stirring the stillness between them. “I, uh, guess I better go before he gets into something he really shouldn’t. But thank you again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is no trouble,” she calls after her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds Kaito in the hall quickly slamming a green door closed behind him. He looks at her, fear in his eyes. “Uh, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re not fucking going in there.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She raises her eyebrows. “Is it... bad?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s hell.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods slowly. “Got it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says no more about the room and begins heading towards the stairs. “Hey, what are you standing around for? We got places to explore!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jogs to catch up with him. “Kaito,” she says watching him take the stairs two at a time. “You have too much energy for your own good.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” he says as she walks calmly up the stairs behind him. “You just don’t have enough energy. Do you work out, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She reaches the top, glaring at him with her one visible eye. “Are you trying to imply something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” he seems genuinely confused. “No, you just reminded me about my astronaut training, and I think we should do it together from now on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s settled then,” he says. “Let’s start tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede says. “What’s settled? Kaito, what are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m talking about us working together from now on,” Kaito says. “We’re going to be a team, alright? Today, we’ll explore the school, and tomorrow we’ll beat up the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Again, Kaede’s mind swims with possible things to say to such grand statements. She settles on, “we’re finding the mastermind tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Okay, maybe the next day, but the point is that we’re gonna figure this shit out, and,” he frowns. “And I know I can be kinda hotheaded, but you can rely on me.” He shoots her a smile, already heading to another door. “And I’m gonna rely on you, got it Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself smiling. She always somehow finds herself smiling around Kaito. “Got it,” she smirks. “Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He grins and pushes the door decorated with a tennis racket open, and Kaede catches it before he disappears completely.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As you might be able to guess from the spiked chapter counter and the sheer length of this chapter, my goal for this fic has shifted to being a near complete rewrite of V3. Since this project is now way bigger than I originally intended, I am now lowkey looking for a potential beta reader.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito dribbles a tennis ball on a racket, leaning this way and that to keep it centered. “I have got to ask Ryoma to play a match with me later,” he says, eyes fixed on the ball bouncing up and down. “When I was taking lessons in middle school, everybody knew him—really big fucking deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s inspecting pitching machine. “You used to take lessons?” she asks distractedly. “Were you any good?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please,” he snorts. “The great Kaito Momota is awesome at everything he tries.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks to him, a wry smirk on her face. “Is that so?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hell yeah, it is, here,” he jerks his chin towards the racket stand. “Play me right now, I’ll show you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think I’ll have to pass,” Kaede says. “Besides—I doubt the others would appreciate it if we slacked off in exploring to play tennis.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Guess you’re right, but still.” He hits the tennis ball up in the air higher than before and easily catches it when it comes back down from its arc. “We are definitely playing a game as part of training.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She raises her eyebrows. “I doubt Ryoma would appreciate us wandering around in his lab at night, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He doesn’t own the lab,” Kaito says, walking over to her. “Well, I mean he does, but it’s not like anyone’s just gonna hang out and fucking stop other people from checking out their stuff.” He nods towards a door near the back. “By the way, what do you think’s in there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to approach it. “Shower room, maybe? Places like this usually have one, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He drops the racket and ball into a pile near the edge of the net. “Let’s check it out. There might be something cool like, uh,” he frowns. “Self-dispensing soap or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede slowly turns around to give him a long look. Kaito brushes past her and starts pushing the door open himself. “I couldn’t think of anything cool that’d be in a bathroom, alright? There’s probably just—” he steps inside “—uh. This… isn’t what I was expecting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pokes her head around him to peer inside the room. Her eyes widen. “This… looks like a prison,” she steps inside, gazing around with special attention directed towards the barred showers and the row of neatly hung handcuffs. “It’s still a shower room, but it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens one of the shower’s gates. “Definitely has showers at least,” he runs a hand through his hair. “Seriously, why the fuck is this like this? Shouldn’t it be more—I don’t know,” he gestures vaguely. “Tennis-y?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede bites her lip. “Ryoma did say he’s a criminal, so maybe this is Monokuma taunting him or something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He snorts. “I fucking hate that bear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She approaches the lone window of the room, and says over her shoulder, “you’re not alone.” Kaede pushes it open. “Oh! Momo-Kaito, come look!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Find something?” he says, staring down over her head through the open window. “Oh, shit we have a pool!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Below them, a long shallow pool runs the length of the room the window opens into. Standing around the edges of said pool were three of their classmates, all of whom turned their heads up in surprise at the sound of Kaito’s voice. “Ah!” Tsumugi gasps, pointing up towards them. “Korekiyo, Ryoma, look!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins and reaches a hand out through the window, happily waving to them. “Hello, down there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The three gather under the window. Between his mask and hat, not a single feature can be seen on Korekiyo’s face from the angle they’re staring at him. “I assume this means your part of the school connects up with ours then?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess so,” Kaito calls down. He turns his head to Ryoma. “We’re actually in Ryoma’s research lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His posture changes, and Kaede sees the traces of something slightly interested creeping through him. “That right?” he asks, keeping his voice level. “Anything I should know about in there or just tennis stuff?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s stomach drops, and she tugs at Kaito’s sleeve. She lowers her voice so only he can hear, “should we tell him? You know, about this room?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks like he’s about to refute her immediately, then pauses. “Uh, well,” he rubs the back of his head. “He’s gonna see it later whether we tell him or not, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she says. “It just seems so cruel to show him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo’s the one to call out, “Are you two whispering something about our dear Ryoma up there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even from her place at the window, Kaede can see Tsumugi wringing her hands and Ryoma sending the taller boy a dark look. “I’m not anybody’s ‘dear,’ you got that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please excuse me then,” says Korekiyo evenly. “Simply a slip of the tongue. However, my mistake aside, I believe our friends are still whispering.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quickly shakes her head with exaggerated motion. “No, no—we’re just,” she looks at Kaito who shrugs, as unsure what to say as her. “We’re, uh,” she sighs. “Ryoma, we think Monokuma designed your lab to make fun of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that so?” he says slowly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sorry, man,” Kaito says, always the first with encouragement. “Most of it has cool tennis stuff, though! And you should totally play a game with me later!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma seems to visibly deflate and turns away from them. “I told you before,” he says. “Tennis is behind me. And, personally,” he sighs, “if the bear designed it to laugh at me, then I don’t particularly feel like giving him the satisfaction.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to walk away, and Tsumugi takes a step after him. “You’re not going to check out your lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “No point. You guys can play tennis if you want, but leave me out of it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes follow him as he leaves the pool. She hears Tsumugi mumble out, “Ryoma,” then gasp. “W-wait! We’re not done exploring yet—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe we should let him leave, Tsumugi,” says Korekiyo. “I don’t think there is much more to explore here anyway that the two of us can’t handle.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I guess you’re right,” she says, before turning her face up to Kaede and Kaito. “Do you two need any help up there? Oh! And wasn’t Kirumi with you? Did something happen to her?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito answers for them. “Nah, Kirumi’s just distracted with some vacuums we found in her lab, that’s all. And,” he looks briefly to Kaede for confirmation. “I think we’re good? There’s probably not a lot more up here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” says Korekiyo. “While we’re talking, should we perhaps schedule a place to meet up to discuss our findings?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yes!” Kaede says. “We were just thinking about that a little while ago. Tell anyone else you run into that we’re going to all meet in the gym!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Understood,” he says. “Well then, Tsumugi, should we keep investigating?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yes,” she replies. “But, it’s a bit troubling that Ryoma left before he heard about our meeting plan…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito yells, “Don’t worry about it! I’ll make sure to find him even if I have to run around the entire fucking school!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede remembers when Kaito did just that for her only hours before. Kaede also finds herself smiling. Tsumugi and Korekiyo walk off, the former choosing to give them a last wave goodbye, which Kaito eagerly returns. “So,” Kaede says once they are comfortably out of earshot. “Do you think I made the right call in telling Ryoma?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“About his lab?” Kaito asks, leaning away from the window. “I don’t think it was even a call. I mean,” he shrugs. “He was gonna find out either way. Might as well be from us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs and pulls Shuichi’s hat down. “I know, I just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just nothing,” Kaito turns, ready to leave. “You wanted to protect him—I get it. But sometimes the truth’s the truth, you know?” He shakes his head. “And Ryoma’s tough.” He shoots her a bright smile. “I’m sure he’ll be back to his usual self after I talk to him about our meeting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t reply other than to raise her eyebrows at whatever Kaito thinks Ryoma’s ‘usual self’ is. Kaede’s mind briefly flickers to the morning when Ryoma offered his life so everyone else could live on past the time limit. She remembers how Rantaro had shot him down and boldly said he would end the killing game himself. She remembers how Rantaro’s corpse boldly started the killing game itself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s already leaving the room when Kaede shakes her head to clear it of ghosts. She ends up jogging the first few feet to fall in step with him, and she puts on her best carefree smile like a mask when he looks down at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Outside of Ryoma’s lab, Kaede spies two more doors. She grips the handle of the larger one looming over them. It doesn’t budge an inch when she tries to pull it open. “Looks like it’s locked,” she says. She turns her head to Kaito. “Other door then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah. Guess this is as far as we can go for now then,” he says on the short walk down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Seems like it. Monokuma said more of the school would open if there was another trial, but,” she frowns. She thinks of Rantaro’s corpse. “There isn’t going to be another trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Damn straight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s still smiling at his comment when she moves to pull open the red and gold door. Her fingers barely graze the handle, when it’s pushed open from the inside. Kaede steps back in shock, hearing the sound of Kaito actually jumping behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s red eyes glare at them from the crack in the door. She quickly scans the two of them, and Kaede suddenly pulls her outstretched hand towards her chest as if she were burned. The motion must have been too late as Maki says with a sigh, “What do you want?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito recovers first. “We’re exploring this floor,” he smiles. “Guess you snuck past us at some point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes but emerges from the slightest opening in door she can manage, careful to close it behind her. “I didn’t sneak past anyone. I simply walked up the stairs and came here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” he says. “Pretty stealthy for a childcare worker.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her glare turns icy at the comment, a sneer rolling across her face. Something about her expression strikes a chord in Kaede, and an unexpected anger surges through her. “You don’t have to make that face,” she says before thinking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns her dark glare on Kaede, who swallows, doing her best to stand strong. “I’ll make any face I want.” There is no emotion in her voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Listen, uh, Maki,” Kaito says, clearly uncomfortable with the tension brewing between them. “We’re almost done looking around, so do you wanna come with us? All we’ve got left is this room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This room is my talent lab,” she says flatly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you can give us the grand tour,” Kaede replies, attempting to smile at the other girl. “You’ve obviously already been inside, so you can show us around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d rather—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Choke on glass?” Kaede finishes. Kaito’s staring at her now, too, making her self-conscious enough to let out a nervous laugh. “You, uh, said that earlier when we asked if you wanted to explore with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s expression is unchanged. “And my opinion hasn’t changed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “You sure? I mean,” he puffs out his chest. “We’re pretty great. Me and Kaede are partners now, so there’s not much we can’t do. ”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “You obviously can’t tell when to shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede says, taking a step towards the girl. “I understand that you’re still angry about the trial and that you don’t like me, but you have no reasons to be rude to M-Kaito.” She takes a deep breath, hardening her resolve. “And all we want to do is look around your nursery center to see if there’s anything useful before we go meet with everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one comes in this room,” she says. “And if you try, there will be screaming. Your—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please, don’t make threats, Maki,” says Kaede. “I really don’t want to pick a fight about this, but you’re plainly being unreasonable about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s my room,” Maki says. “I can do whatever I want with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaito’s scratching the back of his head. “We kind’ve already been in every other talent room we’ve seen, and everyone else seemed cool with it. I mean, even Ryoma didn’t mind and his was, uh…” Kaede sends him a pointed look. “Well, Ryoma has a pretty fucking rough past, and he didn’t care if we looked at his tennis stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in agreement. “Exactly. Is there a reason yours is different, Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stiffens. “I don’t have to say anything to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede attempts to swallow her slowly mounting frustration. “Maki, you kind of do,” she says, purposefully staring her straight in the eyes. “The situation we’re in makes it hard to trust people, and I really, really,” she sighs, “really get that. But that’s what makes everyone cooperating even more important.” She pumps her fists. “You can not like me as much as you want, but we’re still going to get along.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito—at the very least—is convinced by her speech. “Yeah! In fact,” he smiles. “I’ve decided that I believe in you, Maki. So let’s start working together right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re both delusional,” she says. “And I stand by what I said about this room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems more confused than anything else. “But why? Are you embarrassed about a bunch of cribs or baby dolls or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I still don’t have to say anything to you, idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He opens his mouth to respond, but Kaede’s already beat him to it. “And I said that you have no reason to be so rude to Kaito,” she crosses her arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, Kaede,” he says. “It’s fine—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not, though,” Kaede says. “And, frankly, you deserve an apology.” She turns to Maki expectantly. “Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki observes the situation coolly. “You’re treating me like I’m a child.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Maybe I am, but I wouldn’t if you’d—” she recalls the way Kirumi reprimanded Kokichi “—act like an adult instead of making snide comments.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito begins to attempt to get between them. “Listen—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me? Act like an adult?” Maki says. “I’m not the one who’s been running around hiding behind a hat and Kaito’s coattails all day.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s blood turns cold. The confident answer she knows she should give (‘I have not been hiding’) dies in her throat. Instead she manages, “Kaito and I are friends. That’s why we’ve been spending so much time together,” and the words come out far less convincing than she intended.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito attempts to back her up. “That’s right—we’re partners. And partners stick together.” He smiles, somehow. “Do you want to partner up with us, Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can think of nothing she wants less in that moment when Maki ignores him completely to say, “So you’re only hiding behind Shuichi? That’s a pretty rude thing to do to someone who’s dead.” The words leave her mouth and Kaede flinches as if Maki had reached out to slap her across the face. Part of her thinks that it would have hurt less if she did.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kaito barks. “Maki, that was really out of line—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says, tugging down the brim of Shuichi’s hat. The hypocrisy of the action makes her sick to her stomach. “She’s right. I’ve…” She shakes her head. “Let’s just go… we don’t have time for this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks down at her, worry and a near desperate want to understand practically radiating off of him. He opens his mouth, but cuts the words off when he catches Maki standing as stoically as ever in the corner of his eye. He gives Kaede a curt nod, but his eyes never leave Maki when he says, “Yeah, we’ll be back, though. I’ve still got some stuff to say to you, Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s already started the walk down the hallway, and he trails after her, calling back to Maki still standing with her arms crossed in front of the red and gold door, “We’re all meetin’ in the gym, Maki. You should come.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki doesn’t respond, and Kaede’s nearing the stairs. Kaito gives her a last look that Maki chooses not to find any meaning in, and heads after Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He catches up to her when she’s halfway down the stairs. Taking them two at a time, he calls out, “You know she only said that shit to get us to leave, right? It’s all bullshit, and you shouldn’t listen to any of her—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It doesn’t matter why she said it,” Kaede answers without pausing in her flight down the stairs. “It’s true. I’m supposed to be leading everyone and I’ve been using Shuichi as an excuse to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sounds of a door hurriedly clicking open causes Kaede to look up from under the brim of Shuichi’s hat. She stutters to a stop, and Kaito nearly crashes into her from behind. In front of them, the green door Kaito had fled from earlier opens, and Kirumi emerges, hastily brushing something with entirely too many legs off her shoulder. She seems nearly as surprised as them when she suddenly registers their presence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” she says, regaining her composure. “I was just looking for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods towards the door. “We’re not in the hell room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi says, “I found that out the hard way, yes.” She folds her hands in front of her, the strange flashlight carefully gripped before her. “I’m afraid I spent more time examining the array of vacuums than I intended. Is,” she catches sight of Kaede’s face under the shadows of Shuichi’s hat. “Ah, did everything go alright with your exploration upstairs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her face to the side. “We just finished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi looks up to Kaito for answers. He rubs the back of his neck. “We ran into some of the others, and, uh,” he mulls over his next words for what seems to Kaede to be a painfully long second before saying, “and we agreed to all meet in the gym to go over shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” Kirumi says. “Perhaps you can fill me in on your findings then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess that’s the plan, yeah,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You two should go on ahead,” Kaede finally speaks up. “I… will be at the meeting, but,” she grips the straps of her backpack. “I’d like a little time alone first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi says, “Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede manages a smile. “It’ll probably take a little while to round up everyone, yeah? I know it’s a bother, but just send someone to come get me before it starts—I don’t want to miss anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You sure?” Kaito frowns. “Kaede, you remember what I said earlier? You can rely on me and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she answers. “I just think that maybe I’ve been doing a lot of that today, and,” she shrugs. “I just need a little time alone with my piano… to de-stress. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “You’re not budging on this, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. Kirumi glances between them quizzically. “It would appear I missed quite a lot,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces a laugh. “I’m sure Kaito can explain everything on the way to the gym. Or maybe if you want to help him search for Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, shit,” he says. “I forgot about that. Oi, Kirumi, you round everyone else up, I’ll look for Ryoma, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there something wrong with Ryoma?” Kirumi asks. She furrows her brow. “Also when did you run into Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s weird window thing—I’ll explain on the way.” Kaito begins the walk back, and Kirumi shoots one last concerned look towards Kaede before hurrying after him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waves after them as cheerfully as she can. The sounds of their footsteps—Kaito’s loud stomps and Kirumi’s heels softly clicking—fade into almost nothing before Kaede’s own heavy legs guide her to her talent lab.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The bright yellow walls and beautiful, untouched piano greet her. She slumps on to the piano bench before years of training turn her back into a straight line. There’s already music set up for assorted classics, and Kaede idly flips through before settling on one piece more out of a lack of care for playing anything specific than a deep want for a particular song. Clair de Lune is out of the question.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The rounded pattern of the notes comes easily, though perhaps more depressed than intended for the already melancholic song. Her chosen tempo is also likely slower than necessary, but Kaede chooses to let the moving melody linger over the repeating notes. Getting lost in the specifics of the music is easier than confronting the emotions it brings out, and letting the emotions of the piano speak for her is far, far easier than confronting her own hurt voice inside her head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nears the end of the piece, and the sound of someone moving quickly and scurrying to a stop in the doorway echoes in the edge of her hearing. It’s too deliberate to be Kaito’s stomping slippers, which means someone else has come to retrieve her. Kaede doesn’t look up from the sheet music in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her visitor doesn’t approach until she’s done. Kaede can’t help but sigh over the last notes that wash over the room. When the finality of the piece has sunk in, Tenko’s voice says, “That was beautiful, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s first thought is how her chosen visitor could have been so much worse, and she nearly winces at the sharp reminder of how poorly she has been acting as a leader. She says, “Thank you, Tenko,” and lies, “I didn’t hear you come in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko only arrived a little while ago,” she says, stepping hesitantly into the room. “She didn’t mean to eavesdrop on you or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s okay,” Kaede says. “I’ve always kinda preferred playing in front of an audience anyway, if that makes sense.” She runs her fingers along the tops of the pristine keys. “Music is meant to be shared, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stops next to the piano bench. Her voice so much softer than the notes Kaede had been playing before. “Tenko is glad you didn’t mind sharing your music with her. What song were you playing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Chopin,” Kaede answers. “The most famous of his Nocturne pieces. It’s actually kind of overplayed, but,” she flips the sheet music book closed. “I guess I’m a little low on inspiration right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That is reasonable. Tenko doesn’t think anyone in our current situation would be able to be easily motivated to perform.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Kaede pulls at the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “I actually wanted to play one song yesterday,” Tenko’s looking at her confusedly until she says, “for Shuichi. But, that’s not a possibility anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko understands…” she says. She shifts from foot to foot. “Ah, Kaede, Tenko is supposed to get you for a group meeting, but if you need more time, Tenko can make something up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I said I’d go, and,” she reaches for the brim of Shuichi’s hat again before stopping herself midway through the action, “and I need to stop using Shuichi as an excuse for everything.” She lets out a humorless laugh, “in fact I’m doing that right now—hiding up here instead of going to a meeting I organized myself. I’m not much of a leader, am I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says softly, gingerly taking a seat next to her. “Hiding your emotions or pretending they aren’t there doesn’t make you a good leader. Maybe you do need to put on a strong front sometimes, but,” she offers her a reassuring smile, “Tenko would rather follow someone who mourns their friends’ deaths than someone who acted like they didn’t matter. And Tenko wants to follow you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels the beginning of tears threatening to fall from her eyes. “That’s very kind of you to say, Tenko. But I’m afraid that I’ve let you down already,” she runs her fingers over the brim of Shuichi’s hat, but doesn’t pull it down. “Did you know Shuichi used this to hide from people? I told him he shouldn’t, but… that’s exactly what I’ve been doing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is quiet for a moment, thinking hard. “Tenko thinks… you should wear it anyway, and that… maybe it could mean something different for you than it did for him. It doesn’t have to be something you hide behind but,” she pauses, attempting to find the words, “but maybe something to remind you to work extra hard to look at the world around you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She puts a hand on Kaede’s shoulder, an almost out of place determined smile on her face. “And Tenko thinks you could also honor his memory with it, if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede brushes her eyes with the back of her sleeve. “You’re going to make me cry, Tenko,” she says, an odd happiness somehow finding its way into her words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah! Tenko is sorry!” she says. “Unless crying is good right now. In that case, Kaede should cry as much as she wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a small laugh. “I think I might, but not right now.” She looks up at her, lifting her head as high as she needs to stop Shuichi’s hat from blocking her out. “We’re late for the meeting, aren’t we?” And then she’s smiling. “Maybe I should practice ‘looking extra hard at the world’ then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko returns her smile and jumps to her feet. “Tenko knows you can do it! And she will be behind you all the way.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands. “Alright, but don’t let me hide behind you, got it?” she says. “You can flip me if I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can do that,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s left worrying slightly about how easily the other girl agreed, but when they arrive at the gym doors, Tenko steps back and makes a point of Kaede pushing them open to reveal their twelve classmates standing scattered before them in little groups. Even Maki is there, crossing her arms and standing a step away from everyone else. Their entrance goes relatively unnoticed, and Tenko nods to Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a deep breath before clearing her throat and clapping her hands. “Alright everyone,” she says. Twelve pairs of eyes turn on her. Kaede stands her ground like she couldn’t before in front of just Maki’s cold glare moments earlier. “Let’s report our findings.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s s brief awkward silence, and Kaede makes a point not to let a single muscle waver during the thick, uncomfortable quiet until Gonta says, “Uh, Gonta and Kokichi and Angie found a casino.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with his words, conversation sparks alight anew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks and says, “I wanted to be the one to tell them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Gonta is sorry!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clasps her hands. “A casino? How dramatic! Oh, if I went there I’d feel just like a certain gothic lolita from a visual novel!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu examines her nails. “The only kind of gambling I do is strip poker. Any of you virgins be up for a game of that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but Kiiboy couldn’t play,” says Kokichi. “Guess he’d have to wait outside like the other useless robots.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I should be allowed to play any human game I want to!” Kiibo says indignantly. “Miu, tell me the details of your game, and I will learn immediately.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his hat. “You really don’t want to do that to yourself, kid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God told Angie that the casino is a lot of fun, but that there isn’t anything important there,” says Angie. “God does think we should all totally meet there to have fun though!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Kaede says, breaking through the chatter. Just like that everyone’s attention turns back to her. She doesn’t need to turn around to know Tenko’s beaming with pride behind her. “Who’d like to go next?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo steps forward. “Tsumugi and I discovered that there is a pool, though the water is rather shallow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma was also there,” Tsumugi adds insistently. “And, uh, Monokuma also came by to tell us that swimming is banned during night time, and,” she wrings her hands, “if anyone tries to, an alarm will sound and the Exisals will come after whoever broke the rule.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi’s visible eye widens. “That is a rather intense punishment for swimming after hours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “Just like the fucking bear though. So that means the cafeteria, gym, and pool are off limits at night unless you wanna get killed for no damn reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we’ll avoid the pool at night,” Kaede nods somberly in agreement, and turns to Tenko. “Tenko, what did your group find?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was fucking boring as shit,” says Miu before quickly being shushed by one stern look from Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nearly jumps on the spot. “Tenko’s group found Himiko’s amazing talent lab! It was truly befitting of an Ultimate Mage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ultimate Mage—” Himiko pauses mid correction. “Y-yeah, there was a lotta magic stuff for a mage like me.” Her face goes blank. “I could probably do almost any spell with all the stuff in there…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stage whispers to Kaede, “You may not be able to tell, but that face means Himiko is happy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at Himiko staring vacantly back at her. “I… see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh!” says Angie. “Himiko, you should put on a magic show! God says it will be super amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko blinks. “I guess I could…” she says slowly. “If everyone wants me too… then maybe I could show off a few spells.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds wonderful, Himiko,” says Kaede. “My group also found a few talent labs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Yeah, Ryoma, we already told you about yours, but there’s also Kirumi’s, Gonta’s, and Maki’s on the second floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta gasps. “Gonta’s talent lab is open? Are there bugs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Big guy,” Kaito says. “There are so many goddamn bugs. You will not be fucking disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s smile grows even larger, and Kaede decides to hurry the conversation along, lest he decide to leave to befriend the insect hordes before they’re finished. “We also found one more thing,” she says. “Kirumi, do you have the, uh, flashlight?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi steps forward. “We found this in a strange chest upstairs. While I was gathering everyone, I believe Tsumugi asked me what it was, and Monokuma came by to inform us it was called a ‘Flashback Light.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Flashback Light?” Kaede asks. “So it helps you remember… something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Perhaps. I’m afraid I do not know the details,” Kirumi says. “Only that we were told to use them when everyone is present or they will not… remember, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “This is fucking proof then that our memories being missing is his fault.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe that is true, yes,” says Kirumi. “But, for the time being, should I turn it on?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks to Kaede for an answer, and almost everyone follows her lead. Kaede takes a deep breath. “I think we should. It might be a risk, but,” she pumps her fists, “we’ll never make progress if we don’t try. Whenever you’re ready, Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi nods back at her and waits till everyone turns towards the strange mechanical flashlight in her hands. She presses the button, and Kaede’s world goes white. Then everything twists, and she feels her memories swim around her flashing, fast and burning, searing across her mind like a glowing brand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The world fades back into existence Kaede gasps. “I… remember now… I,” she cradles her head in her hands, “I was chased and gave up my talent, my memories…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-wait,” says Miu. “Y-you were chased by—was it the Ultimate hunt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shouts, “Hey! That’s what was after me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me, too,” says Kiibo. “I… assume that it was the same for everyone, then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but,” says Tsumugi. “What were they exactly? I-I can’t remember. I know it’s important, but I can’t…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Now that you mention it, I can’t recall anything, either. Just having to run. We all erased our memories willingly though… that’s the part that concerns me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. Something else flashes through her, the gentlest, most familiar words whispering, <i>“I want to die, together, with everyone else…”</i> and it terrifies her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes the words away as fast as they came. “W-wait, everyone stop. Didn’t Rantaro say something about hunters before?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, that’s right,” says Kokichi. “Our dead mysterious pretty boy seemed to have known a lot more than he ever was able to tell us.” His eyes slide to Kaede. “Real shame he can’t tell us anything now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut, and Tenko speaks for her. “Dwelling on that will solve nothing. What we need to do now is decide where to go from here with this information.” She looks to Kaede. “What do you think we should do now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You and Tenko have a plan together?” drawls Himiko. “I wanna hear it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta also nods. “Gonta would also like to hear Kaede’s plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki speaks up for the first time since she entered the gym. “How dumb can you all be?” she says. The liveliness of the conversation screeches to a halt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns to her. “Oi, Maki. You’re forgetting what we talked about earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “You talked at me until I was forced to come here to shut you up. I never agreed to anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re here,” says Kaede, Maki’s cold red eyes turning on her. She barely suppresses the rising urge to duck behind Tenko for protection. “And you’re part of the group.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d prefer not to be part of any group led by someone who attempted to kill everyone,” she says. “If you all want to put your faith in someone like Kaede, leave me out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says tersely from behind Kaede, “What do you mean ‘someone like Kaede?’”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes. “I mean someone driven by naïve trust, who’d blindly place their faith in a murderer because they smiled at them.” Maki shakes her head. “The fact that you’ve all forgiven her is unbelievable.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito takes a step towards her saying, “Maki, that’s enough.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” says Kaede. “No one has to forgive me for what I’ve done, but acting the way you are only makes us weaker and plays into what Monokuma wants. Being uncooperative actively endangers everyone else, and I am not going to tolerate that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then it’s your lives on the line,” she says, a dark look on her face. “Not mine. And if you keep up that attitude then you’re going to be the first to go.” She takes a step forward, and Kaede involuntarily takes a step back. Something about the look in Maki’s eyes sending fear down her spine like ice. Something about it makes her feel like a helpless prey animal about to be tore to shreds. And Maki takes another step forward. “I personally wouldn’t be surprised if someone tried something tonight with someone like you. Everyone must be thinking about how easy it’d be. You’re plainly the easiest target, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to likely stutter out a too quiet defense against Maki’s words, but is beaten to the punch by Tenko leaping forward and slamming the open palm of her hand into Maki’s jaw. The moment of silence that follows is deafening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki jerks backwards, hand reaching up to gently touch the place of impact, more surprised than anything else. Tenko’s standing between them now in a battle stance. “Tenko is very sorry, Maki, but boy or girl, Tenko will not stand idly while her friends are being threatened. That was simply a mild warning strike, but Tenko will use her Neo-Aikido if anyone tries to attack Kaede or any of the girls.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Except for Maki?” chimes Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He goes ignored, as Kaede says, “Ch-Tenko, you didn’t need to,” Maki’s predator eyes flash through her mind, “do that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki straightens her posture, and her fists are clenched with a tight, furious control. The glare she sends Tenko is one of pure death. Kaede takes a step backwards, but Kaito says, “Maki, are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s pigtails whip around her as her head snaps to the direction of the exit, and she marches out without another word, arms stiffly held at her sides, and nails biting in her palms. Tenko doesn’t relax her battle stance until the doors swing shut behind her. “Perhaps Tenko overreacted,” she says, a touch more nervous than before, “but just now she sensed a killing intent coming from Maki. Please understand that she had to do something…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks around the room, eyes lingering on a slightly less blank faced Himiko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “‘Killing intent?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “Tenko, she was way out of line, yeah, but you can’t just hit a defenseless babysitter. I’m gonna go talk—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kaito,” says Kirumi. “I hate to intrude, but I do not believe that is the best course of action right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Yeah, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll leave her alone for a while. Same goes to you, Tenko, if you feel like apologizing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will apologize for acting rashly later, but not for defending Kaede,” she says. “When Tenko used her Neo-Aikido against Maki, she sensed something off about her. Tenko stands by that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” says Korekiyo. “That is quite impressive to gleam an individual’s intent from striking them. I would be very interested in observing your technique.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko would prefer if you did not,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-wait, everyone,” says Kaede. She turns to Tenko. “What did you mean by ‘killing intent?’ Was Maki planning to… surely she didn’t want to kill me just then?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can’t know for sure,” she says. “But Tenko has been in battle for self-defense many times before, and the energy Maki was giving off was something…” she searches for the right word, “insidious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” says Kokichi. “So you don’t know for sure. What do you think, Kaede? You were the one she was threatening after all. Did you feel like you were about to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens and closes her mouth a few times. “I… don’t know what I think. B-but,” she strengthens her stance and makes eye contact with the now unnoticeably unsettled people filling the room. “We still all need to stand together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “Even with someone murderous like Maki? And what about the mastermind hiding among us? Should we stand together with them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses her mouth into a thin line when she says, “There is reason to suspect someone is not who they say they are, yes, but blindly doubting each other and keeping secrets will get us nowhere.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A silence falls over the room again, and Kirumi clears her throat. “I believe that everyone is understandably a little on edge. Perhaps we should adjourn our meeting for the time being?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, I think that’s best,” Kaede nods. “Let’s all meet at breakfast tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A series of nods and grunts meet her as they file out of the gym. Kaede makes to wait to let everyone else leave before her, Tenko still at her side. With everyone’s eyes finally off of her, she lets herself finally acknowledge the shakiness in her legs and turmoil in her stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko pauses before them and gives Tenko a long look before leaving without a word. The action causes Tenko to mumble to Kaede, “Tenko will begin writing an apology to Maki tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Glad to hear it,” says Kaito from behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins on her heel. “Just like an awful boy to eavesdrop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wasn’t fucking eavesdropping, I was just,” he rubs the back of his head. “Listening in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To preempt whatever response is likely circulating through Tenko’s mind, Kaede says, “Is there something you wanted, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Kaito!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “Look, I get that Maki’s been really shitty to you today, but it’s kinda my fault she came to the meeting in the first place.” He sighs. “Sorry, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, you were right to bring her,” Kaede responds. “It would’ve been bad if she missed the Flashback Light because she,” she lets out a breath, “might want to kill me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “That isn’t going to fucking happen, alright? Me and Tenko, here apparently, are here to look out for you.” He smiles. “And with a little training, I’m sure you can take on any babysitter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can someone explain to Tenko what is going on!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think Maki is a childcare worker,” Kaede answers. “And, Tenko, Kaito and I are partners now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blanches. “You’re partners with an awful boy? Tenko only left you alone for an hour!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Hey, I’m not that bad. And, as your partner,” his face turns serious. “I’m gonna try and talk to Maki later. I mean, not right now, but, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get it,” says Kaede. “Do you still want to train tonight?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Training?” says Tenko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he answers. “Me and Kaede are gonna start training at night to get stronger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She crosses her arms. “Tenko will come, too. She doesn’t like the idea of Kaede being with an awful boy alone at night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “You can invite yourself along without insulting me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’d be happy to have you,” says Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two bicker a bit more, and Kaede looks out at the empty gym from under her hat and sees the day stretch out before her. She’s free until tomorrow morning, and Kaito and Tenko are behind her, ready to chat, offer encouragement, and fight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When she leaves her room to train that night, her thoughts are still full of the day before. It all happened so quickly and so slowly, and she’s so wrapped up in it that she almost doesn’t notice Korekiyo calmly peering out the glass doors when she moves to push them open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wasn’t expecting to see anyone tonight,” he says. “But it would appear I’ve been proven wrong once again. You’re up rather late, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She jumps at his voice. “Ah, good evening Korekiyo. I guess I am,” she says. “But, uh, what are you doing up at this hour?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He points a bandaged finger out through the glass panes of the door. Her eyes follow it, and she catches the sight of Kaito and Tenko standing in odd poses near the arbor. “I am unsure what is going on between them, but it has captured my attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede laughs. “They’re just getting ready for our night training.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He raises his eyebrows. “Night training? That sounds very interesting, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks back at him. “Do you want to come, too, Korekiyo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is a kind offer,” says Korekiyo. “But I would prefer to simply observe, if it is not a bother to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay with me,” Kaede shrugs. “But,” she frowns. “I guess this also means we’re not being very subtle about it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says evenly. “But, if I may speak frankly, if stealth was your goal, Kaito and Tenko are likely not the best company.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs. “You’re probably right. Goodnight, Korekiyo.” She moves to push the door open, and join her two too loud friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He says, “And to you, Kaede.” And Kaede steps out into a night filled with the sound of Tenko indignantly teaching Kaito the beginnings of Neo-Aikido.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The next morning when Kaede wakes up stiff and sore from trying to keep up with an astronaut and a martial artist, she sees a small video player on her table. Kaede picks up the brightly colored player with tiny letters on the back labeling it the “Monokubs Pad” and turns it on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nearly drops it when the words “Maki Harukawa: Ultimate Assassin” appear on the small screen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I've been using "Ultimate" for the sake of brevity, and it was only on this chapter that I realized I have no idea how the localization is going to handle "Super High School Level Hunt," so I made something up. Also as you may have guessed from the ending, motives will be the same, but play out in different ways.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede speeds out of her room like a bullet. Her legs and arms protest in sharp spikes of soreness after her attempts at exercise the night before. The sheer physicality necessary to perform even the basics of Neo-Aikido had been a surprise. The sheer amount of danger the main practitioner of Neo-Aikido is in was also a surprise. Her rapid-fire knocks on Tenko’s door had gone unanswered, and though some part of Kaede knew a host of reasonable explanations existed, her first instinct at not being answered was to sprint around the school in a panic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The video player jostles back and forth in her backpack as she races along the thankfully cleared garden path, nearly knocking a slightly dazed Kiibo to the ground when he tries to greet her at the front of the school. Kaede’s quick shout of an apology to him, causes her to slow down enough to register Kirumi dutifully sweeping the dirt gathering around the front doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi’s already looking her way due to Kiibo’s squawking. “Is everything alright, Kaede? You seem distressed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries to her, Kiibo a few confused steps behind. “Kirumi, have you see Tenko? It’s really important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not since yesterday, I’m afraid. The two of you are the first ones I’ve seen this morning,” she answers, then looking over Kaede’s shoulder. “Kiibo, have you seen anyone else?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have not,” he answers. “My guess is that everyone else is still asleep.” Suddenly he seems very proud of himself. “They should try to get an earlier start on their days. I am always very punctual with my sleep schedule, and am happy to see at least a few of my fellow classmates are as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s not listening. “That’s really nice, Kiibo. Kirumi, are you absolutely sure you haven’t seen anyone else? Is there any chance someone slipped past you or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi furrows her one visible eyebrow. “I believe… there is always a chance of that, but I do not know why someone would do such a thing.” She frowns. “Kaede, is there something the matter with Tenko?” Then, she seems to realize something all of a sudden. “Oh, Kaede, did you receive a video player as well this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got one, too?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo announces, “I received one as well!” in a vain attempt to continue being part of the conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi nods. “I did. Though I believe it was not meant for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mine wasn’t addressed to me either,” Kaede says. “I wonder if there was a mistake or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” says Kiibo, cutting off her train of thought. “Did you get a video meant for Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she shakes her head. “It isn’t like that. I just really need to talk to her as soon as possible. For… other reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi and Kiibo exchange a look. “Well,” Kirumi says. “I believe everyone will gather for breakfast soon. And we will likely need to discuss the strange videos then as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds very efficient, Kirumi,” says Kiibo. “And speaking of efficiency, I wanted to ask you a question about what you’re doing right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows at him. “Kiibo, there is currently a crisis going on and you want to ask Kirumi about sweeping?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’ll be very quick, and there is little we can do about the ‘crisis’ at this present moment,” Kiibo gives Kaede a reassuring smile, and turns to Kirumi. “Kirumi, I am curious as to why are you using a broom for this job. Wouldn’t a vacuum be more effective?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses both hands to her face and doesn’t even bother to hide the groan that escapes her. Kirumi is slightly taken aback at the mundane question, but answers, “Ah, well, Kiibo, vacuums are more suited for cleaning floors inside, and,” she spares a look at Kaede massaging her temples, “would be a bit too powerful for what I need when simply clearing the walkway. So a broom is sufficient.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” he hums.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Kiibo, maybe you could ask Kirumi these questions over breakfast.” She shoots Kirumi a beseeching look. “Please?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yes. Perhaps it would be wise to move this discussion to the cafeteria,” Kirumi says. “I’d be happy to answer your questions about cleaning while we wait for the others there, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends Kirumi another grateful look before they ascend through the school towards the cafeteria. At their destination, Kaede doesn’t even try to contain her nervous energy and begins pacing back and forth across the long room, Kirumi's wary eyes following her with concern. Kiibo’s voice amiably asking the other girl questions about the nuances of housekeeping provides a humming soundtrack to the sound of Kaede’s nerves fraying at the seems.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta and Angie push open the cafeteria doors not a second too early. Kaede’s head snaps to them. Gonta’s in the middle of issuing a good morning when Kaede says, “Did you two also get video players?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head to the side in an exaggerate motion, arms folded easily behind her back. “Are you talking about the motive videos?” she asks, tilting the other way. “Because that’s what Angie got this morning and Gonta, too—God says everyone got one!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, God did not tell Gonta anything,” Gonta says putting a hand to his chin. “But he did get a strange video.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi stands from her seat at the table. “If that’s the case, then it can be assumed that everyone got one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie puffs out her cheeks. “Angie just said that God told her that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi frowns, unsure how to respond. Kaede claps her hands. “Gonta, Angie,” she says. “Were your videos addressed to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Gonta. “Gonta’s video said it was for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” shouts Kiibo. “Gonta, do not say another word. Revealing who has whose video is likely a bad idea if the current situation is what I think it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him. “What kind of situation do you think this is?” she frowns. “And why didn’t you say something earlier when we were waiting around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo triumphantly places his hands on his hips. “I thought it would be best to wait for everyone else to present my theory.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that why you spent the last twenty minutes asking Kirumi about cleaning?” she asks flatly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi clears her throat. “While I understand that we are waiting on the others to wakeup, perhaps we should send someone out to gather anyone who might simply be wandering around the school?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, oh!” says Angie. “Angie and Gonta already took care of that. Kaito was up when Angie left her room, and he told us that we should go to the cafeteria since Kirumi would probably be there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Kaede slowly. “Kaito’s taking care of it, and you and Gonta… did what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie throws her arms in the air. “We came to the cafeteria! God told Angie that everyone would be meeting here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kaito told you to—never mind,” Kaede shakes her head. “Guess there’s nothing we can do now but wait.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At her words, Angie and Gonta nod, and Kiibo eagerly turns to Kirumi, the beginning of a question about dusting already leaving his mechanical mouth. The relief Kaede feels when the room slowly fills with their classmates rolls through her tired limbs in waves. When Tenko finally enters the room alongside Himiko, it surges to an ocean.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries over to her and lowers her voice to a near indistinguishable whisper below the ambient chatter. “Are you alright, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks up at her. “Uh, good morning, Kaede,” she begins. “Tenko is fine… she got a weird video, but she’s fine.” She glances around the room, before ducking her head lower to Kaede’s. “Did something happen? Does Tenko need to use her Neo-Aikido on someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede shouts, the sudden volume of her voice turning a few heads. Kaede laughs nervously and addresses everyone when she says, “I was just saying that no one should fight right now, and we should all be friends... and get along!” Kaede internally thanks Shuichi’s hat for obscuring the slim beads of sweat she knows are emerging on her forehead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns. “You sound like that robot bear… the robot-robot one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives a slightly more natural laugh. “Ah, yeah, I guess I kind of did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That is a good observation, Himiko, but Kaede is right.” She raises her voice to be heard over the last few conversations—Kaede woefully picks out Kiibo’s voice asking about vacuums among them. “We may have been given another motive, but we all need to work together to keep everyone safe, even the awful boys.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi speaks up. “Oh? Is that what you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That you’re awful?” Tenko pulls a face. “Tenko thinks she has made that pretty clear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A strange smile creeps on to his face. “Now that’s the better attitude to have,” he folds his hands behind his head. “You want to fight half the people here—stick with that. Oh, oh! And make sure to punch someone like you did with Maki yesterday!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko curls her lip into a sneer. “It was not a punch. It was—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steps between them. “No one is punching anyone—” she spies Tenko’s betrayed face, “using Neo-Aikido on anyone. Instead we’re going to calmly wait for everyone to show up, and then we’re going to calmly talk about what to do with the videos.” She takes a deep breath, “and everyone is going to be calm and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The cafeteria doors slam open behind her, sending a piercing smack of wood hitting wood resounding through the room. Kaede doesn’t need to even turn around to finish thinking: Goddamnit, Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The boy in question begins shouting as Ryoma and Tsumugi make a much quieter entrance around him. “Maki won’t fucking come out of her lab,” he announces before pumping a fist. “Who here’s with me to try and get her to come out?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede almost feels bad for him when the deafening silence greets his enthusiasm. She’d feel worse if there was a person on the planet she wanted to see less than Maki at that moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi opts to break the awkwardness with a soft cough into her gloved hand. “Ahem, Kaito, I believe Maki might be averse to joining another group meeting right now, so—since everyone else is here—it may be wise to start without her and have someone fill her in later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For a second, Kaede thinks he’s on the edge of arguing with her when he lets out a frustrated sigh and rubs the back of his neck. “Fine—you’re probably right. Guess I’ll talk to her later,” he says. The energy in his voice leaps back tenfold when he spies Kaede and moves to clap a hand on her shoulder. “Alright, if we’re starting then we better fucking start. Kaede—what should we do, fearless leader?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” she says, smiling despite herself. “First—to make sure we’re all on the same page—this morning everyone got a video that we can assume is the next motive. Except something probably went wrong somewhere since it seems like everyone got someone else’s video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “W-wait. Everyone got someone else’s?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Yeah. Didn’t you fucking watch yours, Shittygane?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I did, but,” she begins wringing her hands. “But I think it was <i>my</i> video, you know? I mean, it had my name on it and everything so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “You got your own video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods weakly. “Is that bad? Did no one else…” she looks around the room at the blank stares. “Oh.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “I guess that makes my decision slightly easier then.” She takes a deep breath. “I think…" she prepares for the incoming hurricane, "that the best solution to this is that we all watch them together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo is the first to jump up. “Kaede! What kind of suggestion is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Under the weight of a dozen suddenly hostile stares, Kaede bites back her real answers. A suggestion that exposes the assassin hiding among the group who probably wants to kill me and Tenko. A suggestion that ensures nobody makes stupid plans on top of each other that get people killed like I did with Rantaro. A suggestion that means I don’t trust half of you as much as I say I do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Instead, with Kiibo baring down on her, she chooses, “I think the best way to tackle this motive is to confront it head on instead of just hoping it goes away by itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s shaking his head, something confused and almost hurt in his expression. “But the situation we have been handed allows us to ignore the videos completely—as long as everyone agrees not to trade, there is no motive.” He looks at Tsumugi wilting in the corner of the room. “And Tsumugi’s already admitted to watching her video, so I do not believe her situation is a problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that sounds right,” says Gonta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie thinks so, too!” she says. “God says that trading the videos is a bad idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s giving Kaede a hard look that nearly makes her reach for the brim of Shuichi’s hat. Kiibo says, “Returning the videos to their owners would be playing right into Monokuma’s hands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip and racks her brain for a reason they should listen to her that’s not ‘I don’t trust you,’ when Ryoma comes to her rescue. “I agree with Kaede,” he says. “I say we trade them back or watch them together. Don’t really care which.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, Ryoma and Kaede, of all people, have the right idea,” chirps Kokichi. “So that makes three for watching—oh, better include Tsumugi!—four for watching and how many was it against?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips towards him and is in such a state of shock at being defended by Kokichi that Ryoma’s the one who says, “What do you mean by ‘of all people?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I didn’t mean anything in particular by it,” Kokichi smiles. “Just that with your past, Ryoma, you and Kaede have more in common than you think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck does that even mean?” says Kaito, finding his voice. “Oi, Kaede—you kill a bunch of mafia members at some point?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just sighs and pulls at his hat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede's shaking her head. "No, I--why are we even talking about this? Look,” she straightens her posture, preparing to put her foot down, “I know you don’t agree, Kiibo, but I’m the leader, and I have a plan that we’re going to follow. Tomorrow, everyone gets together in the projection room, and we watch all the videos as a group. That way everything’s out in the open, and no one can sneak around. It’s the safest plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo folds his arms but does not challenge her. The chorus of blank faces before her do not challenge her. Kaede isn’t sure if she should be happy about that or not.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums again. “Kaede, do you think your friends would sneak around behind your back? That’s not very trusting of you,” he sniffles. “You should be more like Kiiboy and believe in everyone.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-Do not call me that!” Kiibo shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “What are you talking about? You were agreeing with me not even a minute ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess I was!” he smiles. “Of course, I was lying earlier—though which one’s a lie is a little tricky to figure out, isn’t it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stage whispers to Kaede, “Can Tenko flip him?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “At least, not right now—maybe later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Waaaah!” Kokichi bursts into tears. “Kaede and Tenko are going to beat me up like they did to Maki!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” says Ryoma. Suddenly all attention snaps to him as he speaks with the greatest authority Kaede has ever heard. “Shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kokichi does, the sobs from earlier fizzling into a blank slate in seconds. Seemingly satisfied, Ryoma turns to Kaede. “Kaede,” he says, voice a degree kinder. “Your plan to watch the videos is…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right,” she answers his prompting. “Tomorrow night. Projection room. Miu, do you think you could find a way to hook the video players up to the projector?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If I don’t fucking get executed for tampering with them, then yeah,” she says, tossing her hair over her shoulder. “The great Miu Iruma can easily do something as pathetically boring as that. It’d be easier than making a virgin c—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I’ll leave it to you,” Kaede smiles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Wait, I could get in trouble for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I sure hope Kaede’s movie night lives up to my expectations,” Kokichi trills as he makes his exit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s protests echo dully in the background over the noise of everyone slowly meandering out of the room. Kaito turns to Kaede and announces, “Still not sure about your plan, Kaede, but I’m gonna go relay everything to Maki. See you la—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” Kaede lunges forward and grabs his loose sleeve. “Kaito, you—um,” she glances around the room quickly, and then, in a hushed voice, “I need to show you something about Maki. I don’t think you should be alone with her—I don’t think anyone should be alone with her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns, but lowers his volume to match hers. “Why’s that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She raises one finger to signal him to wait, and calls out, “Tenko? There’s something I need to ask you about really quick.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko perks up at the sound of her name and easily walks over once she sees Himiko exit the room. “What’s the matter, Kaede?” she jerks her thumb at Kaito. “Do you need Tenko to flip him?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought we were cool, Tenko,” says Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Even if you are marginally more acceptable than most awful boys,” she says. “Tenko will still not hesitate to use her Neo-Aikido to defend Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito’s not the one you need to worry about protecting me from,” Kaede says. The two turn to her immediately, but she nods her head towards the door where the last few stragglers—Kirumi, Kiibo, and a sniveling Miu—linger. “I need to show you something, but I’d kind of prefer to keep it quiet for right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Should we go to Tenko’s room?” at the same time Kaito turns to shout at the door, “We’re having a private meeting in here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu points a shaking finger at him. “S-Stop fucking ordering me around like I’m your sub, you oversized otter!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Miu,” says Kirumi, pointedly choosing to ignore her comment. “Would you like some help in setting up the projector? Perhaps I could be of assistance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose I could help, too, then,” says Kiibo. “I still have qualms about this plan, but…” he turns to Kirumi, eyes shining bright, “I would like to ask you a few more questions, if you don’t mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi smiles down at the little robot. “I’d be happy to help, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He beams back, and Miu’s eyes dart between them. “K-Kiibo, you-you like machines and computers and shit more than maid fetishes, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi is visibly taken aback. Kiibo says, “Miu, I may be a robot, but that does not mean I am interested in technology. Thinking that would be the case is blatant discrimination against robots. And I personally would rather listen to Kirumi." He beams up at the startled maid. "She has many interesting things to say about the proper behaviors for leading a refined human life, and I would like to learn from her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, thank you, Kiibo, that is very kind of you,” says Kirumi. “But, perhaps, we should have this conversation while helping Miu, however?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “I agree. And I would be very grateful if you could tell me more about being a maid on our way.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two make to the leave the room, and Miu dashes after them, her words coming fast and frantic, “b-but I’m still your favorite, right? I-I can repair you and c-clean you! Kii—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors swing shut, and Kaito brushes his hands against each other. “Well that takes care of that. Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s still blinking after the trio. “Uh, right,” with a shake of her head, she shrugs her backpack off her shoulders, and hurriedly takes out the video player, hunching herself around it. “Look at this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She flicks it on, and the words “Maki Harukawa: Ulimate Assassin” appear anew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The video plays on dully over Kaito breathing out, “Holy shit. That’s…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is pale. “That isn’t true, is it? Because if that’s true…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” says Kaito. “You actually picked a fight with a goddamn assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko knows that!” she shouts. “Te-Tenko—” she whips her head to meet Kaede’s eyes. “Kaede, is this why you were worried about Tenko this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yes, and,” she shoves the still playing video back in her backpack. “It’s also kind of the reason why I pushed showing all the videos so hard. We’re… in a lot of danger the longer this goes unchecked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito. “Won’t Maki be super pissed off if you just fucking expose her like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, but,” says Kaede. “I’d rather have her be mad at me than have her try and kill me. Especially since it’s my fault she might go after Tenko, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Well, we don’t know that she’s going to fucking go after anyone at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s exasperated. “Tenko already sensed a murderous intent from Maki yesterday when she used her Neo-Aikido… and Tenko probably made her really angry.” She turns back to Kaede. “Tenko thinks the two of us should stick together until the video showing… and far away from Maki’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slaps a hand to his forehead. “That’s why she’s not letting anyone into her lab. Fuck, it all makes sense now, here,” he raises both hands. “I’m gonna go talk to her—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You—what!? No!” shouts Kaede. “You’re actually going to willingly be alone with the Ultimate Assassin? An Ultimate Assassin who probably isn’t the biggest fan of you? Near her whatever that’s probably full of weapons?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t stop walking backwards towards the doors. “She doesn’t know I know, and besides,” he shrugs. “Ryoma’s killed people before, but he feels bad about it—maybe she’s the same way.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks that is an awfully big risk to take,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” he pushes his back against the doors. “Like Kaede said, this can’t go unchecked. Someone has to do something, and of the three of us, I’m the one she’s the most likely to talk to, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs and bites back the deep worry gnawing at her. “There’s no talking you out of this, is there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” he grins.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs again. “Please just be careful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko places her hands on her hip. “Don’t get yourself killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His grin grows wider. “I can promise one of those things. I’ll see you guys later for training, alright? Maybe I’ll even bring Maki with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He disappears through the doors, and Tenko just shakes her head. “Boys always make reckless decisions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede offers her a small smile. “Maybe not all boys, but definitely Kaito, at the very least.” She crosses her arms. “I guess the two of us have some free time, since I, uh, don’t really want to check up on Miu right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko claps her hands. “Oh, does that mean Kaede has time for Tenko to show her something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, I think so,” she says. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko takes one of Kaede’s hands in hers. “It’s a surprise. A magic surprise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is audibly disappointed when they burst into Himiko’s lab to discover it empty. With Kaede and her sore limbs dragging behind Tenko, the two end up parading around the school hand in hand until Tenko spots Himiko sitting at the table under the arbor, her head pillowed in her arms. Kaede nearly trips over her feet to match pace with Tenko’s sudden sprint at seeing the sleeping girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko waves her hand not currently gripping Kaede’s, and shouts “Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko lifts her head from her arms in a daze, her hat flopping forward on her head when she looks up at the two of them suddenly standing over her. Tenko grins down, while Kaede reaches a hand out to steady herself on one of the arbor’s pillars. Himiko responds to Tenko’s enthusiasm with a resounding “Huh? Is it time for dinner already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenkos says, smiling broadly. “It is still light out, Himiko.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” she looks around slowly at the shining blue sky. “I guess it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clears her throat. “So, Tenko, you said you wanted to show Himiko something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” she exclaims. “Himiko, earlier Tenko found a deck of cards in your lab and was wondering if you could show her and Kaede some magic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko’s already saying “It’s not tricks, it’s ma—oh.” She straightens, a blank expression sliding on to her face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” says Tenko. “You might not be able to tell, but this is Himiko’s happy face.” Tenko presses two fingers together. “You are happy that Tenko and Kaede are visiting you, right Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m happy…” she drawls, “about magic.” Himiko extends one small hand towards Tenko. “You said you had a deck of cards. I guess I can show you a spell or two.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smile as Tenko practically squeaks in delight about handing the present over. Then she finds herself raising a hand to her mouth to hide the laughter when Tenko jumps from foot to foot in excitement when Himiko begins to shuffle the cards back and forth in quick, practiced motions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko turns to Kaede. “Pick a card.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko eagerly looks over her shoulder when she does, and loudly whispers. “Tenko is so excited for this. Himiko’s magic is so amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The cards fly back and forth in front of Himiko’s face, before she eventually calls out the exact card in Kaede’s hands. Tenko doesn’t even need to ask for an encore when Himiko reshuffles and extends the deck towards her this time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She gets it right again, and Tenko applauds her anew. In the next flurry of cards, Kaede spies a slight blush sprawling across Himiko’s tired face. The admittedly impressive display goes on far longer than Kaede imagined it would, losing track of time somewhere between watching Himiko’s increasingly outrageous slights of hand and Tenko’s displays of wide-eyed joy. The only sounds that echo through the empty garden are ones of a rare, bright happiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When a slightly haggard Kirumi eventually comes to fetch them for dinner, Himiko begins to pout. Tenko gasps. “Ah, did Himiko miss her afternoon nap? Tenko is sorry for distracting you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Himiko says. “Well, that too, but I just thought of a few more spells to do.” She frowns. “I guess I was running out of MP anyway, though…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, if that’s the case,” says Tenko. “Maybe you can show Tenko later. Or just talk about them over dinner.” Her smile turns a shade gentler. “Or talk about anything. If Himiko has anything she wants to say, then Tenko is always happy to listen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hops to her feet. “Dunno if I have anything to say,” she mumbles. “Thinking about things to say takes a lot of energy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does,” Tenko agrees easily. “But doing so can set you on the road to friendship.” She looks to Kaede. “That’s why Kaede and Tenko are such good friends now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Himiko fiddles with her hat. “You guys are pretty close, huh? I think,” she pulls the hat down further. “I’m gonna go to dinner… and maybe nap there... since you distracted me...”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shuffles away too quickly, and Tenko calls out, “Y-Himiko! We’re all going to the same place!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pats her shoulder when she slumps them in defeat at the small girl’s hasty retreat. “Did Tenko say something wrong?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says, choosing her words carefully. “Himiko is a little confused, but,” she gives her a reassuring smile. “I’m sure she’ll come around. In fact,” she pumps her fists. “I think everything will work out. As long as the three of us work together, nothing will go wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko raises her eyebrows. “Three of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m including Kaito,” Kaede says, suddenly feeling a little silly. “Even though he’s not here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” she frowns. “Do you think he said something stupid, and Maki killed him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs. “I sure hope not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Tenko’s spirits fall at seeing Himiko almost completely absorbed in eating her dinner so at to not spare her a second look, Kaede finds herself greeted by relief at dinner to see Kaito in one loud, brash piece. Maki does not make an appearance at dinner, and Kaito makes a point to ask Kirumi to give him a plate to bring down to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On his way out of the room, he tells Kaede he’ll meet her at training right after and claps her on the back so hard that she briefly worries the video player inside her backpack will break. When she returns to her room to prepare for the coming exhaustion, she turns it over in her hands to find it as indestructible as the Monopad that Kaito once slammed against the tile floor of the cafeteria with all his strength. Part of her finds it amusing just how Kaito-proof everything in the school is. Part of her also absently wishes that he'll succeed one day in his quest to tear the building apart with his bare hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo’s standing by the tall glass doors again, staring out at the yard. Kaede pauses briefly next to him and sees Kaito’s form already silhouetted against the moon.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Out for another night of training, Kaede?” he asks. “Or are you going to visit Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Training,” she answers. “Did Miu leave?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He places one bandaged hand on his masked face. “She left earlier. I believe to her lab, though she did not stop to make conversation with me, like you did Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Kaede rubs the back of her head. “She might have had a rough day, but, uh…” she absently straightens Shuichi’s hat. “Are you observing our training again tonight, Korekiyo?” she asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you still do not mind,” he answers evenly. “I found it to be quite intriguing last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs. “Well, I’m glad you like it. You’re always invited to join, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Thank you again for your invitation, Kaede, though I am afraid I must still decline.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pushes the door open and the cooled night air swirls in fast to press against her face. “Alright. One day though,” she says. She raises her arms triumphantly at her sides. “And when that day comes, you’ll get muscles as big as Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kukuku,” he laughs. “I look forward to it, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Outside under the starlit sky, Kaede finds Kaito sitting cross legged on the grass, just staring straight up. She folds her legs underneath her and sits next to him without a word. The night shines bright through the bars of the cage, and it looks too breathtaking to be the view from a prison window. Kaede shrugs her backpack off and lays it next to her so she can stretch out on her back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito finally turns to her, grinning at the motion. “You love space, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I love stars,” she says. “There’s a reason there’re so many pieces of music devoted to the night sky, you know.” She stretches both her hands up. “I mean, it’s so pretty and it can make you feel like everything’s connected and like you’re all alone at the same time. I always thought that was kind of amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me, too,” he nods. “Want me to take you to space with me when we get out of here?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “Take everyone. Think there’s enough room on the rocket for fourteen?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s enough for thirteen,” he says. “We can leave Kokichi behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs again when she hears rushed footsteps trampling through the dew covered grass. She turns her head “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We could leave her, too, if you want,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swats his arm when she sits up. She’s about to report the joke to Tenko when she catches sight of the other girl’s expression. All the humor leaves her voice when she catches sight of a familiar video player gripped in the other girl’s hands. “Tenko?” she asks, rising to her feet. “Is something wrong? Why are you carrying that around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stands, too, when Tenko finally approaches, nervously shifting from foot to foot. “Um—nothing’s wrong,” she says, the lie transparent on her lips. “But Tenko decided to watch her video even though it was meant for a terrible boy, and she thinks that we shouldn’t show it at the screening tomorrow.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is it that bad?” asks Kaito, absently reaching for it. Tenko slaps his hand away almost as distractedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Well, if it <i>is</i> really bad, then that’s all the more reason to show it, right? I mean, it’s like with Maki. If we show it, everyone will know who to look out for, and that person will be discouraged from trying anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows that!” she says quickly. “The problem isn’t… here.” She shoves the player forward. “Watch.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito and Kaede exchange a look. He shrugs at her, and turns to watch Tenko press play on the video.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A screen appears that says: Ryoma Hoshi: Ultimate Tennis Player. Then the screen fades to nothing, and Kaede looks up at Tenko, ready to ask what the problem is when the other girl abruptly shushes her. Text achingly crawls across the bottom of the screen, and Monokuma’s voice echoes joyously that he couldn’t find a single person in the outside world who cared about Ryoma Hoshi. He echoes that the tennis play really and truly is all alone in the world, with no one to go back to.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It ends almost as soon as it started. Kaede breathes out the only words that come to her, “Oh God… that’s…” she presses a hand to her forehead. “Ryoma… he wanted to see this so badly and…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck that bear,” Kaito spits.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko agrees,” she says. “And Tenko thought about it and really thinks we should not let Ryoma see this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s shaking his head. “This is so fucking low, even for Monokuma.” He runs a hand through his hair. “The hell are we supposed to do with this fucking thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unfortunately, just breaking it isn’t an option,” says Kaede. “And even if we did… when we show the videos tomorrow, Ryoma isn’t just going to accept that his got broken or lost.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what’s the plan then?” asks Kaito. “We can’t just fucking do nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thought maybe she could ask Monokuma to make Ryoma a new video,” she offers, half-heartedly. “But mostly because Tenko couldn’t think of anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “We’re going to have to postpone the screening. It’s the only thing we can do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko whips towards her. “But what about Maki’s video? Or exposing any secrets the awful boys might be hiding?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For some reason, Kaito doesn’t bite back at her comment, leaving Kaede to freely say, “I know that, but,” she shakes her head. “I don’t think I could live with myself if we forced Ryoma to watch this and he turned around and did something reckless.” The blood on her hands flickers before her eyes. “I… won’t allow myself to be responsible for any more deaths.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede…” says Tenko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine then,” says Kaito, slamming his fists together. “Then it’s decided. We’re not gonna give up on the screening, but,” he looks to Kaede for confirmation, “it’s gonna be held off till we think of something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko agrees,” says Tenko. She frowns down at the video player in her hands. “But what does Tenko do with this in the meantime?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bends down to pluck her backpack off the ground. “I can carry it around. I’ve been keeping Maki’s with me, so I don’t mind holding onto an extra one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kaito. “Do you want mine, too? I mean,” he rubs the back of his head. “It’s not as dramatic as Ryoma or Maki’s, but,” he pulls a face, “it’s weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Kaede raises her eyebrows at him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, just let me get it,” he says, already moving to race off towards the dorms. “I’ll be right back!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jokingly calls out, “Say ‘hi’ to Korekiyo on your way!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shouts back, “Not going to fucking do that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head at him, and turns to the still fidgeting Tenko. “You alright, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko’s fine,” she says. “Just… worried. About everyone—even the boys. Well,” she pauses, sorting out her thoughts, “mostly Ryoma and Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s understandable,” says Kaede. “You’re a very empathetic person, ah,” she gives her a shy smile, “Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is very kind of you to say—ah!” Tenko suddenly shouts, her entire face burning red. “A-Kaede! You—do you want to call Tenko by her first name?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs and fiddles with the brim of her hat. “Ah, if you’re okay with it, and,” she feels her own face begin to warm. “You can call me ‘Kaede’ if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko presses her hands to her face. “This is too much for Tenko! Everything’s happening so fast… but,” she smiles nervously. “Tenko… would be okay with it if Aka-Kaede is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would… Tenko,” and the smile she shares with Tenko sings through the still night air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, shit are we calling Tenko by her first name?” calls out Kaito’s voice, the boy in question quickly approaching, armed with his video player in one hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head as the moment shatters, and Tenko spins on her heel. “An awful boy like you is not allowed!” she says. “This is between Tenko and Akama—Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s all smiles when he hands Kaede his video and says, “Yeah, whatever you say, Tenko.” He crosses his arms when Kaede takes it. “Give me time—I’m gonna think up a good nickname for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You will do no such thing!” she shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two begin to argue, and under the ruckus of their bickering, Kaede turns on the video player to see Korekiyo’s motive play out before her. Her heartstrings pull slightly for his supposedly ailing sister--though the video is noticeably vague about the girl's condition--before her face scrunches in confusion at the strange wording at the end, discussing some goal he needs to complete in the outside world for his poor sibling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede merely shrugs at it when she shoves the finishing video in her backpack along with Ryoma’s and Maki’s. Tenko and Kaito are still squabbling about something, and the stars are still shining brightly overhead. And Kaede thinks about how careful she’ll need to be to keep all thirteen of her friends still breathing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At breakfast the next morning, everyone gathers, and Kaede embraces the host of hostile and confused stares that greet her when she slams both hands on the table and announces the video screening is being postponed. Her heart aches when Ryoma is the first to protest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” he says. “Do you have an actual reason for this, or is someone threatening you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-no one is threatening me!” she says immediately. “And we’re stilling going to watch them all… just not today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hands up in the air. “Does that mean you made me waste all of my precious fucking time yesterday? I fucking slaved over that filthy projector, you blimp-titted—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am also confused, Kaede,” says Kirumi. “You seemed very set on it yesterday. I am deeply curious about your sudden change of heart, if it is not too bold of me to ask.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She just fucking changed her mind, okay?” shouts Kaito over the growing roar. “Leaders change their minds all the time when shit comes up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s face is completely blank. “And what came up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede freezes. “Something…” she looks to Kaito for an answer. He shrugs and gestures at Tenko. She turns to Tenko, who simply looks indignant about Kaito passing the burden of thinking of an answer to her. “Important?” Kaede tries.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Angie. “What is it? What is it? God says Kaede should share with everyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Don’t really know what God says, but I’d like to hear it, too.” The look on his face is one of burnt betrayal. Kaede barely resists flinching under his stare. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows and chooses the words, “It’s going to happen. I promise. I just need more time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“More time for what?” asks Kokichi. “The more time that goes by, the more time a murderer has to plan,” he chirps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo jumps to his feet and points a finger at him. “Kokichi! Do not say such horrible things!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” he asks. “Why not? I thought you guys like it when I tell the truth? Oh, Kiiboy, do you want me to lie to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course not!” he shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, how about a gentle little lie?” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not even one of those!” Kiibo says sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gives the robot a hard look, before a cruel smile slides over his darkening features. “If that’s what you want.” He turns to the group as a whole. Kaede finds herself taking a step backwards at the sight of his near demonic expression. “Kaede and Kiiboy are going to get someone killed. The more they try and make us cooperate with each other, the more we’re going to suffer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-the hell are you talking about?” says Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m talking about this game we’re playing,” he says. “This game with rules and winners and losers,” and he gives Kaede an odd look, “and cheaters. And I’ve decided to play the game the right way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede points a finger at him. “Kokichi, what are you planning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He giggles, childish energy suddenly swarming around him again, the earlier darkness evaporating as quickly as it had come. “Ah, nothing, nothing. I just thought of something really fun.” Then he spins on his heel and begins to skip towards the doors, calling behind him, “Kirumi, do my laundry later! I’m too busy today!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He disappears, and Tenko grumbles, “What an awful boy, saying those things and then running off after demanding something of Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s quite alright,” says Kirumi calmly. “Though I question his earlier comments, I do not mind completing tasks for others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, is that true?” asks Gonta suddenly. “Because if it’s not too much trouble, Gonta would be very happy if Kirumi could bring him a snack in his lab later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Instead of leaping up from the table dramatically, Miu decides to stand perched on top of her chair, precariously wobbling back and forth. “Yeah! Listen up, you frigid prude! Make me fucking lunch right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scoffs. “Gonta! Miu! Do not speak to Kirumi that way!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, one of those was a lot worse than the other,” says Tsumugi. “But, um,” she pushes a strand of hair behind her ear. “Kirumi, I would really appreciate it if you could also do a little laundry for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” says Kirumi solemnly. “Are there any other tasks I should attend to today?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares openmouthed alongside Tenko—who mumbles out a, “not you, too” when Himiko makes a request—as her remaining classmates rattle off a list of chores and file out of the room without a second thought.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pauses after his, and gives Kaede a long, exhausted look before turning to fiddle with the unlit cigarette between his fingers. Kaede stares after him, the sheer look of worry on her face causing Tenko to place a supportive hand on her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito remains focused on Kirumi and shakes his head. “Damn, Kirumi. You really okay with doing all this shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is really no trouble,” she says. “In fact, it is my preference to have too many tasks than too few.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, Kirumi, that isn’t fair to you,” say Kaede, finally tearing her gaze away from the spot where Ryoma stood. “Everyone shouldn’t be so dependent on you—you’re not our mom.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kirumi replies, smiling gently. “But I really do not mind. Knowing people depend on me is a motivation, not a burden.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “If you’re sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” she says. “Now, Kaede, would you like to stay for lunch? I believe Miu, Korekiyo, and Ryoma requested something.” She pauses. “And Kiibo will also likely be there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dude, Kirumi, what is up with you two?” asks Kaito.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi shakes her head. “I’m afraid I could not tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi,” says Tenko. “Tenko understands that you do not mind doing chores, but if anyone disrespects you, let Tenko know, and she will show them the power of her Neo-Aikido.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you for the offer, Tenko,” she says politely. “But if you’ll excuse me, I’m afraid I have many tasks to attend to today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Right, we’ll get out of your hair then. Actually,” she lifts her arms to the ceiling, stretching out her back, “I think I’m going to take a nap for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Training wearing you out already, Kaede?” Kaito grins. “You’re going to have to get tougher than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am tough,” she says, lightly punching his shoulder. “This morning was just... draining. In a lot of ways.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps and punches Kaito’s other shoulder not as lightly. “Kaito, apologize to Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” he says rubbing his arm. “She’s not mad at me, right Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito was being rude,” counters Tenko. “Right, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” says Kaede. “That I’m going to go to my room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The rest she gets is not nearly as restorative as she would have hoped and is abruptly interrupted an hour later by a series of thunderous knocks on her door. Rubbing her still sleep stained eyes, Kaede slings her backpack over her shoulders, and places Shuichi’s hat on her head before pushing her door open to see Kaito’s frantic face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks. “Kaito—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He grabs both her shoulders, and says with a worrying seriousness, “Kaede, you need to run.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nervously glances over his shoulder before, putting his face too close to hers to say, “There’s a monster. It—it’s probably too late for the others, but we still have a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“K-Kaito,” Kaede says. “What are you talking about?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m talking about—oh fuck!” he suddenly throws himself against the wall. “There he is!” he loudly whispers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances in the direction of Kaito’s frightened eyes to see Gonta standing strong in the hall, practically radiating with a strange, overwhelmingly powerful energy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta…” she breathes, squinting her eyes to better take in the sight before her. She cuts her observations short when she hears the soft sounds of Kaito’s slippers backing away from her door. Kaede whips her head to him. “Where are you going?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m getting out of here,” he whisper-shouts back. “And you should, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries out of her room, clicking her door shut and pressing herself against the outside wall next to him. “Oh, you are not leaving me here, Kaito Momota.” She gestures forward. “Now, move! If we just stay here he’s going to catch us… for whatever is happening right now.” She frowns. “What’s happening right now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t fucking know,” Kaito says. “But I did just think of the best hiding spot. C’mon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They creep through the halls and across the open yard for entirely too long in Kaede’s opinion before she has to cover her mouth with a hand to prevent the involuntary squawk that leaves her at seeing Kaito begin to press open the door to the girls’ bathroom. “What are you doing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is our hiding spot!” he says. “Gonta the gentlemen would never think of fucking coming in here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She points a finger at him. “You should never think of coming in here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s a good idea, okay?” Kaito says sharply, shoving the door open with his shoulder. "Now are you coming or what?"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes at the sheer absurdity of the situation. She groans, “Are we seriously doing this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Either we hide in here or we get caught,” he says. “It’s your choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip and pauses far too long.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m thinking, okay!” she says. “Look, maybe we can just talk to—” The sound of panicked footsteps pounding nearby cause both of them to jump. Kaede gestures wildly to the door. “Why are you standing around? In!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees the figure of someone blond and pink and loud enough to get them all caught appear in the corner of her vision before she shoves herself inside the girls' bathroom behind Kaito. She holds a finger to her lips to quiet him, intending to wait for the sound of footsteps to pass. Yet the click-clack of platform boots only screeches stronger and stronger until the door to the bathroom flings open before their slightly crouched forms, a profusely sweaty Miu heaving and framed like a photo in the doorway.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She slams the door closed behind her, and with wide eyes, immediately thrusts a trembling finger in Kaito’s face. “The fuck do you think you’re doing in here, you perverted asswipe!?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hiding from fucking Gonta!” he yells back. “The fuck are you doing here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, running from monster dick, duh!” she shouts. "Get out of my genius hiding spot!"<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">"It's my genius hiding spot!" Kaito answers. "I thought of it first!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jumps between them, hands held in front of her in a desperate attempt to quiet the incoming screaming match threatening to balance around the walls and straight out the doors into Gonta's ears. “Miu, is Gonta behind you? Did he chase you this way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Miu says. “He was up in my fucking tits just a second ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede slaps a hand to her forehead. “Did you just lead him right to us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Miu pauses, the consequences of her actions suddenly hitting her. “I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sound of footsteps the size of mountains slam against the floor outside the door. Miu shrieks, “I-I am not getting caught!” and shoves past Kaito and Kaede, deeper into the room. “Take them instead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one’s getting caught!” says Kaede. “We can all hide together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, into one of the stalls, right Bakamatsu?” Miu says, already swinging one of the doors open with the most bizarre, off-putting eagerness Kaede has ever seen.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even in their panic with the sound of the footsteps pacing down the hall like a rolling boulder, both Kaito and Kaede stop to just stare at her. Kaede says slowly, “into the supply closet.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, right!” she shouts, quickly changing course, and throwing that door open. “Geniuses first!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes but hurries after her. Kaito's on her heels, and yells out as Miu tries to shut the door on them, “Hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sound of the pacing footsteps suddenly comes to a complete halt at Kaito’s shout. Miu and Kaito both freeze in their struggle at the door, and Kaede takes the opportunity to push past them into the supply closet. Gonta’s voice echoes in sheer horror from outside the door, “Kaito! Are you in the girls’ bathroom?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu nearly shoves Kaede off her feet, in her efforts to get further into the cramped supply closet. Kaede hears the door to the girls' bathroom crash open, and Kaito lunges towards them, sending Kaede stumbling backwards and into Miu against the far wall. Miu’s cursing at her, and she suddenly slips off her feet and onto the ground as the wall she was relying on to catch her is suddenly much further away than she thought.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up from under the brim of Shuichi’s hat to see Kaito’s panicked face turned towards the exit as a large hand picks his struggling form up by the back of both of his jackets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s scandalized voice is the calmest of the four of them, scolding Kaito for such ungentlemanly behavior over the other boy’s shouts. Kaede doesn’t even trust herself to breathe until she hears the door click closed behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs when the steps finally fade away, and shakes her head. “I’m gonna have to make it up to Kaito later,” she mumbles to herself. Kaede glances up towards Miu on the floor next to her. “Miu—” then she registers that Miu isn't looking at her, but is on her knees and gaping in shock at the wall behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kaede registers that the wall behind her isn’t there anymore, and a long hallway stretches out before them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">If you're getting antsy for the body discovery, trust me, I am too. Although thinking about my impatience makes me think about the ending of V3 a lot, haha. Also expect a slightly more edited version (mostly typos and such) tomorrow morning since I'm afraid I must admit I didn't spend quite as much time going over this as I would have wanted.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their steps walking down the strange hallway create a deeply discomforting echo. Miu’s shoulders are tightly bunched up around her, and she looks like a scared rabbit ready to bolt and leave Kaede for dead the second anything so much as threatens to appear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her sweaty hands are locked in a death grip around one of Kaede’s arms, reducing their pace to an awkward shuffle. Kaede sighs and takes too loud a step forward as they turn one of the corridor’s twisting corners. Miu yelps. “W-w-what the fuck was that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just me,” says Kaede. She risks taking her eyes off the strange series of pipes that stretch overhead and glances back to the quivering Miu. Her voice is as comforting as she can make it when she says, “I don’t think there’s anyone down here besides us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking bullshit!” whisper shouts Miu, panicked eyes darting around. “The motherfucking, cut-your-dick-off-and-shove-it-back-down-your-throat-mastermind is down here! A-and they’re gonna show up any minute and rip our tits off and eat them!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows at the choice of words. “I… don’t think that’s going to happen,” she turns back to the tunnel. “Mostly because I doubt the mastermind is a cannibal, but also…” she bites her lip. “I don’t think the mastermind is here right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu lets out a low pitched whine as Kaede forces them forward. “And just tell me what kind of shitty logic you’re basing that on, Bakamatsu. We’re in their fucking secret lair, fucking waltzing up to the front door, like a fucking door-to-door meat market,” she says, each curse punctuated with squeeze of Kaede’s arm. “Kiibo didn’t sacrifice himself for you to push me tits first into death’s asshole.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” says Kaede. “We’re going to have a talk about your speech patterns later.” She frowns. “Also what do you mean ‘Kiibo sacrificed himself?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When fucking big dick started his rampage,” she waves one her hands. “Me and Kiibs were having a fucking romantic as shit lunch—even if the three fucking perverted stooges were hanging around—and when big dick showed up, Kiibs sacrificed himself so my genius could live on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I seriously doubt anyone Gonta caught is hurt,” Kaede says shaking her head. “I wish I knew what was even going on with that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No shit,” says Miu. She jerks her chin forward. “Wish I knew what the fuck was going on here, too.” She grumbles, “wish I knew when the mastermind is gonna come shove a knife up our asses.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Miu, trust me. I have good reason to think we’re alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the end of a sudden incline, Kaede finds herself faltering at the prospect of opening the strange metal door that greets her. Miu audibly gulps. “Wanna explain what that fucking reason is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words are for Miu as much as they are for her own reassurance. Kaede takes a deep breath and firmly sets her hat forward on her head with her hand Miu’s not currently holding hostage. “Right now everyone’s really distracted with Gonta… which means the mastermind is also distracted, and the mastermind,” she says, “has to be one of us—there wouldn’t be human sized secret passages like this if they weren’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think of that all by yourself, Bakamatsu?” Miu grumbles without budging an inch from her hiding spot behind Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she clenches her jaw. “Shuichi did.” A fierce, suddenly awake determination surges through Kaede, and she reaches forward and begins to push the door open. “And it’s the mastermind’s fault he’s dead.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shoves it wide open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The mastermind’s lair is empty and black and pink, and centered before them is one very strange object.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu lets out a muffled yell at the sight before them. The giant Monokuma head in the glass tank they suddenly come face to face to lets out a slightly less muffled yell. From behind Kaede, Miu thrusts a finger at the strange robot and screams, “What the fucking hell is that thing!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the same time, the head gasps, “What are you doing here!?” Its red eye blinks rapidly and, in its weird, echoing robotic voice it says, “You’re not supposed to be here yet!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede recovers from her openmouthed shock and takes a tentative step forward, Miu scurrying to keep up with her human wall. “What are you, and,” she swallows. “What do you mean, ‘not supposed to be here yet?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who fucking cares about that?” asks Miu. “We need to get the fuck out of here before that monster eats us!” Miu squeaks as the full implications of her statement catch up with her. She shoves Kaede forward. “Eat her first!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Puhuhuh,” it tuts. “I can’t eat anything, even if wanted to. And trust me, if I could, I would gobble up naughty children who stick their noses where they don’t belong like you two.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu recoils at the words, arms flung up to protect her face. “Don’t eat us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” says Kaede. “Calm down. It just said it couldn’t.” She steels herself and chances a few more cautious steps until she centers herself in the middle of the strange room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Closer up, Kaede takes a hard look at the unmoving Monokuma head, spying the sea of bunched cables that pour from its form. The head does not respond. Miu’s still cowering in the doorway. Kaede straightens her shoulders and stands taller. “And now that everyone’s done yelling,” she shoots an accusatory glance towards Miu, “what are you? You’re… not a regular Monokuma, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The head pauses for too long, and Miu makes her slow approach during the silence. The head has still yet to respond by the time she reaches Kaede's side. She opens her mouth, but Kaede silences her with a raised hand. With as much authority as she can muster, Kaede says, “I asked you a question. What are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It stays quiet, then, “I suppose…” it muses. “I can tell you that now, even if it’s early.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why do you keep saying that shit?” Miu asks. “What’s early?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The head almost seems to pout. “Everything’s early! My grand reveal wasn’t even set up right! There was supposed to be a dramatic curtain pullback like finding the wizard behind the scenes!” it huffs. “But you two came early and ruined everything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede talks over the beginning of the next bewildered question Miu’s readying. “But what do you mean ‘early?’” she asks. “This is the mastermind’s lair, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu turns to her. “Bakamatsu, what the fuck do those two things have to do with each other?” she tosses her hair over her shoulder. “I mean, yeah, I see the giant robot-bear head, too, but I think you’ve fucking lost it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, Miu, think,” says Kaede. “This is the mastermind’s lair—this thing keeps saying we found it early,” she gestures to the head, “and that’s a really weird thing to say—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s face lights in realization. “Because that means we’re supposed to find it later! Holy fuck! B-but,” she jabs her finger at the Monokuma head, “but when are we supposed to find you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Monokuma head makes a soft clicking noise. “You naughty sequence breakers are ruining everything.” Then very quietly, “if any of this makes it to air, I’ll be amazed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What was that?” Kaede asks, straining her already excellent hearing to make out the robot’s bizarre mumbling.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said,” it says, “you’re ruining everything! The reveal of the Mother Monokuma is supposed to be saved for later in the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Mother Monokuma?’” echoes Miu. She snaps her fingers. “Oh, shit does that mean you, like, fucking push out Monokumas and shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Uh, I think Miu’s asking if you make extra Monokumas?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It laughs. “You got it! I birth each and every one of the Monokumas all at my master’s orders! But I only give birth for my dearest, darling-est master when they ask me to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your master… that’s the mastermind, right?” Kaede asks before frowning. “And why do you keep phrasing it that way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu pushes past Kaede and begins looking over the bunches of wires sprouting from the head. “Fucking show me,” she says kneeling down to get a better view of a particular section of cables. “Birth a fucking Monokuma right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I can’t just do that!” It shouts, seemingly taken aback. “I can’t just squeeze one out for anyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede groans. “Please stop talking about it like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, Bakamatsu,” says Miu. “You try asking it—tell it to birth a Monokuma. I got a theory.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pulls a face. “This better be a really good theory.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop complaining, whale tits, and get on it,” she says. “Tell it to birth a Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes but tightly says, “Hey, Mother Monokuma, give b-birth to a Monokuma. Ugh,” she presses the heels of her hands to her eyes. “This is so weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It gasps. “S-so many demands today! And none of them from my master!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shoots up from her crouched position. “Looks like you fucking passed the test, Bakamatsu,” she grins. “Neither of us are the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Mother Monokuma shrieks. “H-how can you be so certain of that all of a sudden?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu struts to the other side of the Mother Monokuma’s tank to inspect the wires protruding from that side. “Whether they want to or not, thinking A.I.’s and shit tend to give away all their cues if you ask ‘em.” She smirks and pats the tank with one cocky hand, “got a clue from the way Missy Monokuma, here, kept talking about its master giving it orders.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did no such thing,” it says. “I would never betray my master like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you fucking did,” she cackles. “This big old furry baby factory is obviously voice activated as shit, else we wouldn’t be having this fucking conversation. Even you could figure that out, right Bakamatsu?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede puts a hand to her chin. “That actually makes a lot of sense, but,” she shakes her head. “How does that translate to neither of us being the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves her arms. “You see a key-pad anywhere around this hellhole? Or anything else that you can put a command into?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes that moment to further inspect the room. The pink hearts glitter on the walls and the lounge like couches hold no secrets as far as Kaede can gleam from a quick once over. “No…” she says. “I don’t, and,” she presses her fist into her opposite palm, “that probably means there isn’t one since the mastermind wouldn’t need to hide anything in their own already hidden room, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t need to think that hard about it,” Miu places her hands on her hips. “All I’m saying is that voice activated shit is obviously voice activated. And,” she kicks the base of the Mother Monokuma’s podium. “Since this hunk of junk keeps repeating the phrase ‘birth a Monokuma’ as an order, my genius self put two and two together and decided that’s probably a command phrase that causes it to shit out a Monokuma when the mastermind says it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu!” Kaede gasps, clasping Miu’s hands in her own. “You’re a genius!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-ah,” she squeaks. “O-of course I am… s-so you should be fucking grateful…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“E-except she’s wrong,” says the Mother Monokuma, somehow sweating bullets despite its robotic form. “Puhuhu, good try, but wrong, wrong, wrong-y wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows. “I seriously doubt that.” Then, turning back to Miu, “Miu, can you check it out a little more? I’m going to look around and see if I can find anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got it,” she salutes before rubbing her hands together. “Ooh, which part of you am I gonna to get inside first?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Mother Monokuma stammers in protest at Miu’s prodding as Kaede begins her search.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, it calls out, “Wait! Nothing’s set up for the big reveal, yet!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede ignores it and begins scanning the room for the deliberate clues that have yet to be placed for the distant grand finale. Miu fiddles with the wiring, and Kaede searches fruitlessly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Gonta plops Kaito down into his bright green research room after a far too long walk filled with far too many reprimands for his ungentlemanly behavior. Inside the room, an already captive Tenko catches the tail end of the last one and delivers a firm chop to the top of his head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck, Tenko?” Kaito says, already abandoning his previous battle with Gonta to clutch at his injured head. “That fucking hurt!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re lucky Tenko is going easy on you right now!” she says sharply. “Once we get out of this situation, Tenko will give you a proper punishment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll fucking look forward to it,” he mutters under his breath. “Now anyone mind telling me what the fuck is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta claps his hands. “Gonta has decided that to fight against everyone’s dislike of insects, he would hold an insect appreciation party! That way everyone can truly see how amazing they are!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” says Tsumugi, holding her hands close to her chest. “What do you mean ‘everyone’s dislike of insects?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good question, Tsumugi,” says Korekiyo from the far corner. “I do not believe I have heard anyone offer a negative opinion on insects during my observations.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah?” says Gonta. “But that’s what Gonta was told! And Gonta wants to help show everyone the wonder of insects!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Something suspicious is going on here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko hates to agree,” she says, crossing her arms. “But if she had to guess which awful boy is behind this mess…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On her cue, Kokichi practically bounces through the door. “Oh, let’s see, how many did you get, Gonta?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of fucking course,” mutters Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta taps a finger to his chin. “Gonta tried really hard, but he wasn’t able to get everyone to come… but this is enough to start the party, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “You did pretty good… Ryoma was probably too fast, right? And Maki wouldn’t leave her lab? I guess that can’t be helped, but Gonta,” he says. “What about Kaede? I really think she should come to the party.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” shouts Kaito. “Kokichi—the fuck do you want with Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His eyes slid to him. “Hmm? Did you say something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you little fucking brat—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, please,” says Kirumi, stepping between them. “Everyone would like an explanation as to why we were all,” she pauses searching for the right word, “aggressively pursued by Gonta to come here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kirumi,” says Kokichi. “Weren’t you paying attention? Gonta’s holding a party so everyone can get over their hatred of disgusting insects and love them as much as Gonta and I do!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta smiles. “Kokichi told Gonta just how much he loves insects and that we should share that love with everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta,” says Kiibo, “do not listen to a word he says! You are being tricked!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” says Kokichi. “Why would I trick Gonta? What a mean thing to accuse someone of…” he begins to sniffle. “Gonta! Kiiboy’s bullying me because he hates insects!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I am doing no such thing!” Kiibo shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, quit the crap,” says Kaito jabbing a finger at Kokichi’s skinny chest. “What are you planning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko falls into a battle stance. “Tenko will give you five seconds to explain before she uses her Neo-Aikido.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aww,” says Kokichi, still on the verge of tears. “This is the worst. Everyone’s threatening me, and all I wanted to do was have Gonta show everyone how great revolting bugs are and then maybe have a little movie night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie coos, “Ooh, like Kaede’s movie night with the motive videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yep,” he says. “I’m getting so tried of waiting, so I think we should do it early, which makes it a real shame that Kaede isn’t here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta deflates. “Gonta tried to get her to come, but she was in the girls’ bathroom with Miu and Kaito… and Gonta didn’t want to invade their privacy…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks. “What was everyone doing in the girls’ bathroom?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie jumps excitedly from foot to foot. “What was Kaito doing in the girls’ bathroom?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito waves his hands dismissively as Tenko shoots him another glare. “Th-that’s not important!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” agrees Kokichi. “What’s important is that we officially start the insect appreciation party!” He turns to Gonta. “Since I already love bugs, it’s okay that I miss the beginning to go get everyone’s videos, but make sure no one who hates bugs leaves early, okay?” Gonta nods in confirmation, and Kokichi claps his hands together. “Alrighty then! I’ll be right back! Have fun, everyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lunges towards the door as Kokichi skitters out of the room. “Hey! You can’t just fucking—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s massive form stops him in his tracks, creating a wall of solid muscle between him and the exit. “Kaito, you can’t leave yet! Gonta hasn’t even started to show you the wonders of insects!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko pulls her hat down over her eyes. “I have a bad feeling about this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry, Himiko,” says Tenko. “Tenko will protect you, and—ahhhhh!” she cuts herself off with a scream as the first insect swarm begins to rise from the previously closed breeding boxes and fill the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Panic erupts through the room. Tenko physically picks up a protesting Himiko while Kaito shoves Kiibo forward in an attempt to buy more time for himself to get away. Kirumi and Korekiyo back themselves into a far corner with Tsumugi scrambling after them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie stands in the center of the chaos and delightedly claps her hands. “Everything will be fine,” she announces. “God says that all we need to do is believe in him, and everything will take care of itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nonchalantly pops open two more boxes and the swarm thickens.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s next prayer falters over the increasingly harsh buzzing and hissing as she, too, begins to retreat to the far side of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The appreciation party continues on. The nighttime announcement comes and goes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t think she’s ever appreciated insects less in her life. At a half-hour in, Angie had established a prayer circle that Tsumugi was desperate enough to join. Himiko wrenched herself out of Tenko’s protective grip to take a seat to listen to how Angie’s God would keep them safe through these trying times.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At an hour in, Korekiyo had seemed to tire of watching Kirumi dutifully pick bugs out of Kiibo’s metalwork, and joined in, Angie greeting him with a joyful cheer, before having to cut herself off when a stray bug flew into her mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At two hours in, Tenko has not budged an inch from her protective guard over the prayer circle. Kokichi has yet to return, and Gonta seems to pleased with himself to even begin to think there was a mistake in holding them all captive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Tenko,” Kaito says, suddenly appearing behind her. “Listen up, I got a plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do not sneak up on Tenko,” she snaps at him. “Also, Tenko isn’t about to listen to any bo—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, yes, I’m a boy,” Kaito says. “But I’m a boy with a plan.” She frowns but doesn’t argue. He goes on, “if the two of us work together, I think we can take him out.” He jerks his chin towards Gonta, standing guard at the door and smiling down at Angie’s payer circle.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She furrows her brow. “But we both got caught earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” he says, exasperated. “But we were apart then. I say, if you distract him, I can jump on his back and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does not want to be the distraction!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I’ll be the fucking distraction! It doesn’t matter!” he smacks a fist into his palm. “Or maybe we can flank him and both attack at once.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta turns his eyes on them, so Tenko lowers her voice to a whisper when she says, “That’s a completely different plan. Tenko isn’t sure about any of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, maybe the plan’s less solid than I made it out to be, but,” Kaito leans in closer. “Either we try and do something and free everyone, or we sit on our asses in here until fucking Kokichi decides to come let us out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs. “Alright, fine. Tenko sees your point.” She glances to the circle on the floor and then to Kirumi and Kiibo sitting quietly in obvious discomfort in the corner. “Should we ask anyone else to help?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” he looks around. “Let’s try Kirumi. Everyone else here is probably… pretty not good in a fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods in assent and steps away from Himiko’s side for the first time since entering the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi and Kiibo glance up when Tenko and Kaito’s shadows loom over them. Kirumi says, “Do you need anything? I’m afraid all of my daily chores are currently on hold.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You seriously still concerned about chores right now?” asks Kaito. “‘Cause personally I’m thinking big guy over there is our biggest problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kiibo. “Our biggest problem is Kokichi.” He shakes his head. “I do not understand why he would go to such lengths to do this. If he pushes watching the videos any further, I will be forced to use my secret ability.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi raises her eyebrows. “You have a secret ability, Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” he says. “However, I would prefer to save it for a dire circumstance as it is a large drain on my power supply.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slams his fists together. “Well hurry up and use it then!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just said I want to save it for a dire circumstance,” Kiibo responds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Tenko thinks this situation is pretty dire.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See? Tenko agrees,” says Kaito. “Which means that it’s two against one. Kirumi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She coughs into a gloved hand. “I also believe that taking drastic action may be the right call for our current situation.” Kiibo sends her a betrayed look.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” says Kaito. “Between the three of us and with Kiibo’s secret awesome robot fighting power, there’s no way we can’t do this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, excuse my asking,” says Kirumi. “But what exactly are we doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Tenko listens with growing skepticism as Kaito concocts an entirely new plan on the spot. She shoots him a look containing as much of her apprehension as physically possible, and Kaito gives her a cheery thumbs in response. Kiibo protests futilely that his secret ability is not what the others think it is, and Kirumi listens politely, offering suggestions whenever too large a hole appears in Kaito’s plan.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko just sighs and spares one last wavering look at Himiko before moving into position. She steels herself to trust Kaito when Kirumi pretends to accidentally upend one of the few previously closed insect boxes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta moves over to help her, and Tenko makes a beeline for the door, her legs shooting her forward in a dead sprint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She darts around Gonta, and he reaches forward to stop her with a worried shout, one of his large hands threatening to pull her back into the room and into the deep pile of bugs Kirumi created. Tenko feels the breeze from Gonta moving to catch her swish over the fabric of her shirt, and he jolts towards her, the words, “Tenko! Wait—!” echoing through the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s prayer circle is now on their feet watching, and Tenko barely dodges his next attempt to grab at her. Her hands find the doorknob, and she knows the time it takes to twist it open is enough for Gonta to pull her back into the room. The giant boy is about to do just that when Kaito leaps on to his back, the sheer surprised momentum of which sends the two hurtling off course from Tenko’s escape route.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She yanks the door open, and spares a glance over her shoulder to see Kaito lasting far longer than she assumed he would on the bull ride that is hanging on to Gonta’s shoulder. Kirumi circles the two in a last ditch attempt to catch him should he lose the current battle, while Kiibo awkwardly dances around the pair.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito spies her pausing and takes a break from shouting for Kiibo to use his awesome robot skill to yell, “Tenko! Run! Get help!” Then, “I know you can do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Tenko sprints down the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her legs move her forward, but her eyes linger too long on the sight of Kaito finally being tossed to the ground. Tenko whips her head around to stare forward and plows straight into Kokichi at the top of the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The video players piled high in his arms go flying, and he lets out a strangled yelp as one of his wind-milling arms barely catches on to the banister to stop him from tumbling down the staircase. Tenko reels backwards, barely managing to grab on to his other arm in her own fall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She yanks him forward, and Kokichi collapses into a heavily breathing heap next to her. “Geeze…” he wheezes out, slowly collecting himself. “Tenko… I said… I would be right… back… don’t have to… push me down the stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Footsteps pound behind them, stopping any remark Tenko could make before it leaves her mouth. Gonta’s leading the pack and issues a gasp in horror at the sight before them. “Tenko, Kokichi! Are you okay? You left the party in such a rush!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko is fine,” she says pushing herself up on to unsteady feet. “Tenko…” she catches the sight of Kaito leaning against Kirumi with one arm wrapped around her shoulders for support near the back of the group. “Kaito!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pushes past the others, “You’re injured! Tenko knew your plan was stupid!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives a weak laugh. “No, it was a great plan, and I’m totally fine,” he says. “Takes more than… being thrown against a fucking wall to stop the great Kaito Momota.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi shifts slightly under his weight, and Kaito winces. She says, “I believe his only injury is one of his legs. Everything else should be fine,” she nods her chin towards Gonta. “Gonta agreed to let us leave so I could attend to it as soon as possible.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta wilts at the sound of his name. “Gonta is very sorry. He never wanted to hurt anybody…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, man,” says Kaito as he and Kirumi hobble past. “I said I’m fine—don’t beat yourself up over nothing, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-yeah,” says Tsumugi. “And it wasn’t your fault, Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah?” asks Angie. “But Angie saw Gonta toss him!” she waves her hands in the air. “Haha! Kaito went flying like a shooting star! Woosh!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta flinches.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I mean,” Tsumugi corrects. “That we all know whose fault this entire thing was to begin with. Isn’t that right, Ou—huh? Where did he go?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins on her heel to see the pile of video players skill haphazardly scattered around the floor above the stairs and no Kokichi in sight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh my,” says Korekiyo. “Sneaking away right in front of an entire group of people—it would seem our Kokichi is quite the master of stealth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” yawns Himiko. “Guess he got away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not if Tenko can help it,” she says. Glancing backwards one last time, she says, “Kirumi, take care of Kaito. Tenko is going after him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Understood,” she nods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you I’m not fucking hurt!” he calls after her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko takes the stairs two at a time. “Stop complaining, and accept Tenko’s sympathy!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She dashes off, and Kaito turns to give the chuckling Kirumi a puzzled look. “Please excuse me,” she says. “I’m just a bit surprised to hear Tenko saying such a thing to a boy.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito finds himself to dumbstruck to complain as he and Kirumi make their much slower decent down the stairs. He hears Kiibo’s voice instructing the others to recollect their old motive videos, and Gonta issuing apologies left and right.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s already dark out when Kaede and Miu exit the bathroom. Walking back down the hall, Kaede says, “Miu, I think this doesn’t really need to be said, but let’s keep this between us, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You fucking know it,” she says. “I’m not about to paint a target the size of Gonta’s dick on my back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “And we are definitely having that talk about your word choice later.” She tilts her head from side to side to stretch out her neck. “Right now we should probably just act like normal. So I’m going to head to training—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’ll be in my lab trying to fucking forget that the mastermind’s a goddamn pervert lurking around the bathroom every time I wanna take a piss—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kokichi suddenly darts around the corner and sprints past them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. Miu blinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Well… something’s probably going on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two girls poke their heads around the corner to see Tenko charging down the hall at high speed. Even at a distance, Kaede can see Tenko’s face noticeably brighten at seeing her. She sprints the last few feet to them, saying, “Kaede! Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, y-yeah,” she says. “I’m fine. Actually, I’m more worried about you. Do you know what was going on earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko just shakes her head. “Tenko will explain tomorrow. Also,” her expression turns serious. “Did you see Kokichi come this way? Tenko needs to punish him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Never figured the little twink would be into that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He just ran past us,” says Kaede. “Did he say something bad… er,” she frowns. “Did he say something worse than usual?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko narrows her eyes. “Tenko will also explain that later,” she steps past them, beginning her chase anew. “Also,” she calls back. “Training is cancelled tonight! Don’t listen to Kaito if he says he can do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, got it!” Kaede calls back. Then, quieter to Miu, “just what on earth did we miss?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cackles. “Dunno, but you and me are definitely going to the next orgy, Bakamatsu.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede groans, but walks the rest of the way to the dorms in step with Miu, the other girls proudly boasting about all the inventing she has planned for that night. They part at the intersecting paths in the garden, and Kaede finds herself almost alone when she pushes the glass door to the dorms open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo’s at his usual spot, and Kaede still jumps backwards with a startled yelp at his quiet hello interrupting her chain of thought. “My apologies, Kaede,” he says. “I didn’t mean to surprise you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no,” says Kaede. “I’m just… distracted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is understandable,” he says. “Today has been… exhausting. I did, however, manage to learn quite a bit about Angie’s God, which was enlightening in its own way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” says Kaede. “Well, I’m glad today wasn’t a total waste for everyone. I mean,” she lies, “I didn’t really do anything besides hide from Gonta, and I’m still tired.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hiding in silence is a very tiring activity,” Korekiyo says. “I have much experience of simply waiting and observing, and it tends to wear on one’s nerves after a time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” she says. “You won’t have to do any more observations tonight—training’s cancelled apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yes, I assumed as much after seeing Kaito’s injury.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pales. “What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suspect he will be fine,” Korekiyo continues. “I simply doubt he or Kirumi will be doing much tonight other than ensuring he does not make it worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She lets out a sigh of relief. “Kirumi’s helping him… that’s good.” She shakes her head. “Someone’s going to have to tell me what happened today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo chuckles. “It is quite the story. I’d be happy to tell you, if you feel it is not too late tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in agreement, and Korekiyo’s calm voice fills the room with a dramatic tale of bugs, over-the-top chase scenes, and more bugs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spends her moments before sleep going over a mental check list of who could potentially be the mastermind. There are fourteen of them left. It’s not her. It’s not Miu (unless Miu lied to her about everything and is just tricking her and <i>killed Shuichi right in front of her</i>)</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shifts uneasily, thoughts and distrust rolling over each other in tangled waves. Part of her prays that it’s someone she doesn’t like—someone who’d be easy for her to accept as a traitor. Someone it’d be easier to know she tried to kill. The thought causes more guilt to bubble up in her stomach, but she pushes it back down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The last thoughts before sleep are of how she crosses her fingers and prays it’s not Kaito or Tenko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But, of course, she can’t be sure.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The thoughts push Kaede into early wakefulness, and she continues her routine of being one of the first morning risers. Kirumi and Kiibo are already in the cafeteria, and each greets her with a slight degree of apprehension.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s hesitation appears to be stemmed in his current attempt to complete the most mechanical, precise sweeping Kaede has ever seen, while Kirumi hurries over to speak as privately as she can with Kiibo still in the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” she says. “I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but yesterday, Kaito—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He hurt himself?” Kaede replies. “Korekiyo filled me in on most of the details last night, but did anything new happen when you were taking of him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi frowns. “No, though he was insistent on disobeying my orders to rest. I wanted to ask if you could perhaps try talking some sense into him.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I can certainly try.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose that’s the best we can hope for,” Kirumi answers with an air of finality. “Now then, would you also like to help in my preparations before the others arrive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks around the other girl to spy Kiibo awkwardly shoving the thick broom in his hands up against the wall. “Ah, Kiibo’s taken quite an interest, hasn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Kirumi. “I am not quite sure what to make of it, particularly since he needs to refrain from the dirtiest jobs or his fans will give out.” She shakes her head. “I keep warning him about that, but he insists.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He can also probably hear us talking about him,” Kaede smiles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He can,” Kiibo calls out. “And he would also appreciate a little help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others slowly file in, and Kaede abandons assisting Kiibo with his extraneous cleaning when she sees Kaito appear with a poorly disguised limp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, morning, Kaede,” he says, giving her a carefree smile. “Glad at least one of us got away yesterday. Man it was wild, but I really—why are you making that face?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns at him. “I know you went and got yourself hurt yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that,” he says. “But trust me—it’s not a big deal. And,” he holds up his hands defensively, “I’m planning on taking it easy today anyway. You’re like the third person to threaten to finish me off if I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “You better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” he collapses into one of the metal chairs. “I think I think I’m gonna spend most of today outside of Maki’s lab. See if I can get her to talk to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You—” Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “You’re so reckless.” She sighs. “Sometimes I worry that you actually have a death wish, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Nah, it’s just that a hero like me can’t just sit on the sidelines. If I let a little thing like this hold me back, I wouldn’t be a very good partner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes. Tenko makes her own appearance in time and launches into her own near motherly scolding. Kaito argues back, and Kaede lets her attention wander as with their amiable bickering calmly playing in the background.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sits quietly at one end of the table listening intently to Gonta asking Kirumi to deliver his breakfast to his lab. Miu is fussing over Kiibo getting himself all dirty, laying out a very detailed schedule of times she could intimately clean him. Angie chatters on about the strange nuances of her God to Himiko and Tsumugi, with Korekiyo curiously writing down her every word in a simple notepad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The high spirits of the room come to a screeching halt when Gonta pulls open the doors of the cafeteria to return to his lab for the morning. He swings it open, and Kokichi stands framed before them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With twelve burningly hostile glares trained on him, Kokichi grins widely, folding his hands behind his head. “Morning, everyone!” he chirps. “I see everyone’s excited to see me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite his leg, Kaito is the first to stand. “You got a lot of fucking nerve showing your face here after yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi giggles. “Aw, don’t worry—I’m sad about yesterday, too.” He reaches up with one small hand to rub at his suddenly glassy eyes. “Hearing my beloved Kaito got hurt…” he shakes his head. “It just tears me up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like fucking hell it does!” he shouts. “Also I’m not your ‘beloved’ anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “You can’t dump me yet—we haven’t even been on our first date!” He sighs. “And I was so excited to meet your grandparents, too…” his face contorts into a dark smile. “Oops. Did I say something weird?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stiffens. “You… what the fuck are you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands. “You watched all the motive videos,” she says. “Didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Maybe—does that sound like something I would do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you,” says Ryoma suddenly. “Or didn’t you?” His glare is one of death. “Answer the question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “Oh, wow, Kokichi, look how mad you made him! Even God is surprised!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your God sure is surprised by a lot of things,” mumbles Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks over the gathering crowd with half-lidded eyes. “You’re all so funny,” he says finally. “You choose the weirdest things to get mad about. It’s really funny,” he smirks. “You should keep it up—getting mad and emotional is sure to make the game really exciting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop talking like that,” says Kaede walking straight up to him to glare down at the small boy. “People have died, and you keep running around doing things like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“People have died,” he says blandly. “That’s right, Kaede. You should know that better than anyone. And you should also know why they ended up that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “I don’t know what game you’re playing, but know that I want absolutely no part it in.” She glances behind her shoulder. “No one here wants any part of it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His eyes slide over the students so definitively arranged on her side. “Then you’ll all continue to suffer,” he concludes. Then with a bright smile, “I hope you all have fun with that! Kirumi, I don’t feel like eating with everyone today. Bring me something later, would you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi does not answer him, and he skips back out of the room without another word. She shakes her head. “I… will probably do that later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spins to face her. “Kirumi, you really don’t need to—it’s not like he’ll just hide in his room until he starves or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If he tries,” says Tenko. “Tenko will bust down his door.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that would help the situation,” says Tsumugi. “And then he’d probably have to room with someone else…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cackles. “I know exactly where the fuck this is going. Hey, hey,” she laughs, “Kaito, he called you his love, yeah? Maybe when Chabashitra fucks up his door, you and he could—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut the fuck up!” Kaito shouts at the same time Kaede says, “Nobody is breaking down anyone’s door!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu starts to snivel, and breakfast continues with its previous animation, with the exception of a new, dark atmosphere hovering around Ryoma. When the others begin to disperse for the day, he approaches Kaede with an almost anxious determination. “Kaede,” says Ryoma, idly fiddling with his cigarette. “A moment of your time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” she fidgets, guilt prickling down her limbs. “Of course, Ryoma. What do you need?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to walk away, but calls over his shoulder. “Come with me. We can talk on the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shoots a look over to quickly confirm with Tenko—Kaito already having left to badger Maki through the door of her research lab—before scurrying after him. The doors swing shut behind them, and Ryoma waits calmly in silence until they round the corner away from the lingering students to begin. “I’m not going to argue with you about the screening,” he says. “I get that you’re putting it off for some reason, and I also get that you’re not about to share that reason with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She reaches up to adjust the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “Sorry, Ryoma. I promise it’s for a good reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t have to explain yourself to me,” Ryoma shrugs. “Your reasons are your own, and I assume you’re doing what you are because you want to be a good leader.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “That’s… very understanding of you, Ryoma,” she offers him a small smile. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d save the gratitude for after I tell you what I want,” he says, tone darkening. “You can see if you feel like thanking me then.” They reach the door to Gonta’s research lab, of all places, and he mutters under his breath, “I’m just doing this for my own selfish reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He slips through the door before Kaede can question him, and on the other side, Gonta’s sitting cross legged and beside himself with delight at having company. Ryoma says, “Mind if we join you for a moment? I need to ask you something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s smile is bright. “Of course! Everyone is welcome! Oh,” he adjusts his glasses, “and if your question is about bugs, Ryoma, then Gonta will do his best to answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not,” he says taking a seat across from the much larger boy. “But if you have something about bugs you want to share, I’ll listen if you still feel like talking to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at Ryoma’s ominous words but sits next to him, care not to crush any passing insects when she folds her legs under her. “I’d be happy to listen too, Gonta. Especially since we both missed the insect appreciation party.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s face falls. “Ah, Gonta is still very sorry about that. He thought everyone was having a good time and learning to appreciate insects, but really Gonta was just being stupid—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop,” says Ryoma. “No one here’s stupid, and no one blames you. Well,” he pulls at his hat. “If anyone does blame you then I guess that makes them stupid.” He shakes his head when the twin looks of surprise on Gonta and Kaede’s faces greet him. “Sorry. Ignore me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “Ryoma’s right.” She offers Gonta a reassuring smile. “Everyone knows the insect party was just a big misunderstanding and that it was no one’s…” she frowns. “Well, it was someone’s fault, but that person’s not you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well said,” says Ryoma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta is still sorry for being tricked,” he says. “Gonta wants to protect everyone, but he hasn’t been doing a very good job so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma curses under his breath, mumbling, “Can’t believe I’m fucking doing this.” Then louder, “Gonta, I got a request for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta perks up at the sound of his name. “Do you need protection, Ryoma? Gonta will do his best to use his strength—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words die when Ryoma pulls out a small, too familiar video player from his coat pocket. Kaede stares hard at Ryoma, and he addresses her when he says, “Figured being transparent as possible was the best way to go about this. Sorry for dragging you here, Kaede, but it made the most sense to let you see everything for yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede works her mouth for a few seconds before finding the words, “You’re… trading your motive video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says before gesturing the player towards Gonta. “Or at least trying to if Gonta’s up for it. So,” he looks at Gonta. “What do you think? I’m not planning on committing murder, if that’s what you’re worried about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta briefly looks to Kaede for help. “Uh, w-well, Gonta trusts Ryoma and wants to help him, but,” he frowns, a defeated sadness overtaking his gentle features. “Gonta doesn’t have your video…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stops, and Kaede squirms on the spot as she practically sees the aching disappointment swallow him whole. “I see,” he says slowly. The image of Ryoma’s video in Tenko’s hands flashes fast and biting through her mind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta is really sorry… You can have the video Gonta did get if you want!” he offers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “No, it’s fine—ignore me. Just figured it was worth a shot.” He shifts, rearranging his legs underneath him as he slowly becomes consumed with the need to explain himself. “Kiibo and Miu were talking about trading videos, so I guess I just assumed all the videos were a one to one switch. That was dumb of me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly perks up at his words. “Kiibo and Miu traded videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Yesterday at lunch before the bug,” he glances at Gonta, “incident, Kiibo let slip he had hers, and then she badgered him about it until he agreed to trade. I wouldn’t be too hard on him.” He pulls a new cigarette out of his pocket almost solely for the sake of busying himself. “Personally, there isn’t much I wouldn’t do to get her off my back, so I guess I sympathize.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just sighs. “I know… I just wish they would’ve told me. I spent almost all day with Miu, and she didn’t say a word.” She cradles her head in her hands. “I really hope she’s not planning anything stupid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Gonta. “Gonta doesn’t think she would, but Gonta… doesn’t know Miu very well.” He frowns. “She actually scares Gonta a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “She scares us all. Still,” she fiddles with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “That’s one more thing I have to worry about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll keep an eye on her then,” says Ryoma. “Might as well do something with my time that’ll be of some good to someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth is glued shut with guilt, so Gonta’s the one to say, “Oh, Ryoma, Gonta understands that you have an important job now, but do you still want to hear about bugs? Gonta knows they’re not a special person, but…” he places one of his large hands on the ground and a previously fluttering butterfly comes to land on it. “They’re still pretty amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s sad eyes watch the butterfly flap its delicate wings and ascend to circle lazily above them. Very slowly, he says, “Guess I could stay for a while…” he reaches into his pocket and pulls out another cigarette. “Oh, do you want one of these? They’re just candy… and I figure I should probably pay you back for letting me hang around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems genuinely confused at the gesture. “Why would you…” the butterfly lands again to perch on the top most curls of Gonta’s hair. “Gonta is happy to spend time with Ryoma.” He smiles. “Gonta doesn’t need anything but Ryoma’s company.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks take aback. Gonta taps a finger to his chin. “But Gonta would also like to try one… if that’s okay…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head, but Kaede sees the smile slowly spilling out over his face. “I wouldn’t offer if it wasn’t,” he says. He pulls out another and offers it to Kaede. “You want one too, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smiles and gently takes it from his small hand. “I’d love one.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her grin only grows wider when she sees a second butterfly has come to settle on one of the points of Ryoma’s hat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede eventually bids the two of them goodbye when evening comes in order to check up on Kaito before training.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She finds him leaning against the wall next to the door to Maki’s lab, and he lifts one hand at her in greeting before when she approaches. Kaede lets herself take a seat against the wall next to him. “Any luck?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” he says. “Oh, she did open the door when I brought her food, but no conversation,” Kaito raises his voice to carry through the heavy door when he says, “but I’m not about to give up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “I see she hasn’t attacked you while you’re down, so I’d count that as a success.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you have a really fucking low expectations for me,” he laughs. “C’mon—I’m a famous astronaut to be, give me a little credit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “I’m sure you’ll get through to her one day… though,” she bites her lip, “I’m still not clear on why you want that. It can’t just be about protecting me, can it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Eh, that’s definitely part of it. But also,” he leans back against the wall. “I have to admit that some of the crap Kokichi said has been getting to me. Like when he said we—what was it—‘knew why Rantaro and Shuichi died’ or something…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls the brim of Shuichi’s hat down. “What about it?” she asks in too small a voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he sighs. “Mostly it happened because the mastermind’s a piece of shit, but I think it’s also cause they tried doing everything alone. Not relying on or trusting anyone’ll get you killed, and if I can stop that from happening to someone else, I will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses and chooses her words carefully. “That’s very kind of you…” she bites the inside of her cheek. “Is that also why you decided to make friends with me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives her a hard look. “I wasn’t really thinking about it like that, back then, but…” he rubs the back of his head, “guess I just like helping lonely people, and,” he grins, “I could tell you were pretty cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs. “Do you think Maki’s cool, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He raises his voice to carry through the door again, “I think Harumaki is the very coolest, and she should come out here to talk to me about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Harumaki?’” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “I thought of it the other day. And she hasn’t complained about it yet, so I’m gonna stick with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs again. “You said she hasn’t talked to you at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means she hasn’t complained, so,” he raises his voice, “I can only assume that means she loves it, and wants everyone to call her it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is no answer from the door, and something about that causes Kaede to erupt into laughter anew. “Well,” she says when her humor cools, “when you’re done talking to Harumaki, I’ll see you at training as long as,” she gives him a stern look, “you don’t do anything that’ll hurt your leg.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, mom,” he says, and Kaede swats at his arm before she heads back to her room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Tenko end up exiting their rooms together, and while Kaede offers Korekiyo hiding in the shadows her routine wave, Tenko just frowns.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo waves back, and, after Kaede elbows her, Tenko does, too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Outside in the quiet night, Tenko begins showing Kaede the basics of the proper footing for her most used Neo-Aikido moves. When Kaito joins them, Tenko and Kaede make the silent decision to switch to purely arm based exercises. He rolls his eyes but offers only a token protest at their concern.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The night wears on, and conversation begins to lull as Kaede finds herself more and more out of breath with each exercise. Tenko and Kaito’s casual banter slows, too, and the stars shine brightly above.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then a sudden crack of a twig breaking echoes through the night, and Kaede hears a startled yell coming from the path around the back of the arbor. Tenko shoots up from her seat on the bench and is already sprinting to investigate the sound.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his leg, Kaito only manages a brisk walk, and Kaede keeps pace beside him, a deep worry silently passing between the two of them. Kaede can’t help but hurry the last few paces around the bushes encircling their training spot.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rounding the corner, she sees Tenko standing before a panicked Kiibo and Miu placing both her hands on her chest in an attempt to collect herself. “What’s going on?” she asks, leaving Kaito behind to run up to the trio. “Did someone scream?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu raises her hand. “I-I did,” she shakes her head, “holy fuck Kiibo, you scared the absolute shit out of me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo jerks oddly but does not speak.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I,” his speech is far too jilted. “I see-seem to be hav-having a malfun-mal-malfunction. I-I-I wanted—need re-repair. I-I need, I-Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you fix him?” Tenko asks. “Uh, Miu? Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes her nervous gaze off of Kiibo to see Miu blushing wildly. “I—!” she shouts suddenly. “I can do that! I can fix you all night!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakily nods his head. “P-please.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins giggling almost uncontrollably as she takes Kiibo’s willing hand to lead him down the path to her lab.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks after the pair, and Kaito snorting behind her finally brings her back to reality. “Those two are fucking weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m,” Kaede starts, “not going to argue with that. Hope Kiibo’s alright, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “He really must be an awful boy, making us all worry like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk back to their training spot, and Kaede lets out a yawn. “I say we call it for tonight—I’m pretty tired,” she glances at Kaito, “and one of us definitely needs rest, whether he wants to admit it or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m fine, I’m fine,” he says. “And besides, exercise is good for you, even if you’re injured or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “That’s not true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, details aside,” he pumps his fists. “I’m getting stronger, and this leg’ll be better in time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs, plucking her backpack off the ground and swinging it on to her shoulders. “I think I’m getting stronger, too." She mirrors his pose. “I can run further, lift more, and my backpack feels lighter already!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She and Kaito trade matching grins while Tenko groans. “Kaede,” she says. “Don’t get caught up in his nonsense! You’re better than that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito squawks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside the dorm, Korekiyo offers as easy greeting, and Kaito salutes the three of them before wandering back to his own door. Korekiyo offers the two girls a, “I believe I will head to my room, too,” with a bow of his head. “As always, I appreciate you letting me observe your training sessions—they are quite fascinating.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pulls a face, but Kaede replies, “It’s no problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo silently slips into his own room, and the door shuts behind him with a soft click. Alone, in the dormitory, Tenko turns to Kaede. “Uh, Tenko knows it’s late, but she wanted to ask you if,” she bites her lip, “if you’ve thought of anything to do with Ryoma’s video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I haven’t. I hung out with him a lot today… but I still have nothing. And putting off the screening is just leading to one mess after another.” She looks up at her. “Do you have any ideas, maybe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko’s been thinking through a few things, but,” she frowns. “None of them seem very practical.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede moves to push her door to her room open. “Wanna talk about them now? I think I could stay up a little later—and the sooner we think of a solution, the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s face flushes pink. “Y-you’re inviting Tenko into your room for the night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her actions suddenly catch up with her, and Kaede feels her face grow warm. “Uh, just to talk and plan and stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-right,” Tenko stutters. “In that case, Tenko will do her best to focus!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods again, and stays up late into the night thinking up plans and then throwing them away again. After one too many scratched efforts, she glances to the clock and to Tenko drifting in and out of sleep in one of her chairs. After a moment of debate, Kaede gently pushes at the other girl’s shoulders till she stirs back to wakefulness with a start.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko’s awake,” she stammers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “It’s okay, you can sleep.” She smiles. “Just thought I’d offer a blanket if you want to spend the night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blushes again, but accepts and falls back asleep by the time Kaede returns to her chair, blanket in hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s own sleep is peaceful, and she does not imagine for a second, that the girl sleeping next to her would ever betray her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sharp, frantic knocks on her door jolt Kaede out of her deep sleep with an abrupt start. Dazedly, she glances around the room to see Tenko’s chair unoccupied, but with the blanket folded neatly to the side. She pushes herself to her feet and glances at the clock to discover that after a late night of futile planning, she has missed her early rising hours.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The knocking does not cease for a single moment as she scrambles over to the door and pushes it open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any complaints at the noise die in her throat when she sees Tenko’s sweating, pale face. She doesn’t need to say a word for the dread to hit Kaede like a truck. “Tenko?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko decided to wake up early,” she begins, her words coming out in a frenzied rush, “and she didn’t want to bother you, so she didn’t say anything, but then Tenko went to the gym to work out to wake up more, and, and Tenko, and” she takes a deep breath. “And Tenko found a puddle of blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s brain refuses to process the words for a moment, and she stands gaping at the other girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s shifting from foot to foot. And her words, “What should we do?” bring Kaede back to earth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-we,” she shakes her head. “We can’t—it was just blood, right? So we don’t… we don’t know that there’s been…” she can’t force herself to form the words ‘another murder.’</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head again. “We can’t know until we investigate. Gather as many people as you can,” she says, “I’ll start looking around the school for…” she swallows “clues.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods in ascent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The journey around the school is painful and turns Kaede’s stomach into sick knots. She finds the pool of blood Tenko discovered in the gym with a few of her classmates staring dumbstruck at it. The rest of the gym is devoid of anything that strikes Kaede as needing investigation, and she leaves, the only new information gained being which few of her classmates she knows for sure are still breathing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s search continues, and she slowly but surely runs into almost everyone. One person she knows she should have seen by now is still missing, and Kaede tries to think of absolutely anything else. Back outside in the garden, she runs back into Tenko with Kiibo now at her side. “Find anything?” she calls out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing!” says Tenko. “But,” she and Kiibo jog up to Kaede. “Kiibo just reminded Tenko of one place we haven’t checked yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “We’ve searched the entire school, but I don’t think anyone’s investigated the outside buildings.” He grimaces. “My first thought is the pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath, and nods, finding whatever remaining strength she has to lead her classmates to the corpse they all know is waiting.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo and Tenko are on either side of her when Kaede pushes the doors to the pool open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps and covers her mouth with her hands while Kiibo takes a step back, placing a hand over his heart. Kaede feels something akin to despair wash over her as she sees the bloodied body lying next to the completely still pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She breathes out, “Kirumi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And a chime goes off to say a body has been discovered.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ahhh, it's been too long. And there's finally a corpse! Some people guessed totally right, but I think that's alright since it means that the discovery doesn't just come out of nowhere and the victim gets some screen time. Although if people want things to be more surprising, I might switch up the style for the next in-game chapter a little since I kind of love hearing people's guesses about victims/murders and stuff, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stands outside the pool building with a grim expression on her face to direct everyone slowly towards the site of Kirumi’s body.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside, Kiibo kneels next to her facedown, motionless corpse, careful not to disturb the small puddle of blood underneath her. Kaede sees his robotic shoulders move up tightly and then relax back down as if he were trying to take deep breaths. She catches herself idly wondering if robots can even cry before walking over to place a gentle hand on his shoulder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo is silent but does not push her away, leaving Kaede to say, “I’m so sorry Kiibo… you two spent a lot of time together… I’m,” she shakes her head. “This shouldn’t have happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he agrees. “It shouldn’t have. It shouldn’t have been Kirumi… it shouldn’t have been anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods her head in grim agreement. The sight of Kirumi’s still body is almost blinding with the rush of emotions it causes to surge through Kaede. Images of the other girl, calm and reassuring and so, so heartbreakingly alive burn fresh and painful into her mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then she remembers the last time she found a corpse, and the raw guilt of Rantaro’s death bubbles up from whatever depths she had slowly been burying it to. But with Rantaro’s death, she thinks, there had been pure, stinging guilt and shame at what she had done. There had not been the sharp fear of the fact that one of her friends was a murderer, and <i>she had no idea who.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stares at Kiibo again, and hates the brief flash of fear she feels towards him. Because she knows he was so friendly with Kirumi, and he’s obviously so upset, so he definitely couldn’t be a murderer. Kaede bites her lip.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t know. <i>She doesn’t know.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sounds of a few entering students echo behind her, drowning out her panic with sheer noise alone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps out, “Kirumi!” and skitters over, kneeling beside Kiibo. “Oh no,” she says in a smaller voice. “God didn’t tell Angie this would happen! Angie actually liked her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma and Tsumugi make a slower approach, the latter having gone pale and clasped both hands over her mouth in shock. Ryoma eyes the body for a moment before letting out a deep sigh. He pulls down his hat a little further and says, “Goodbye, Kirumi—you were one of the good ones.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie coos in agreement, “She really was.” She steeples her hands above her head. “Angie will pray for God to help Kirumi make it peacefully into heaven.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede offers her a smile. “That’s very kind of you Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm,” she hums. “You should pray, too, Kaede. In fact,” she glances around before placing a hand over one of Kiibo’s metal ones. “God thinks everyone should pray together. If everyone prays, then God will totally let Kirumi into heaven, no problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi tilts her head. “Is that how… getting into heaven works?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yep, yep! Ooh, Tsumugi, if you’re interested, Angie could totally tell you all about God and how great he is later. God always guides Angie in times like these—and in regular times, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… see,” says Tsumugi, perplexed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God is always with Angie,” she goes on. “And it’s basically the best. Tsumugi, if you want, God could totally be with you, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “Stop using Kirumi’s death as an ad for your cult.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie puffs out her cheeks in protest, but any further comments become lost in the sounds of more hurried footsteps. Kaede looks behind her in time to see Miu shriek and physically leap backwards, a dull thud echoing through the room as she collides with Gonta behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the impact, Miu starts forward, only being saved from careening straight into the pool by Gonta’s large hands reaching out to steady her shoulders in a flash. He starts to say, “Miu,” to comfort her before spying the cause of her distress. He’s fast on his feet, and—though likely unintentional—ends up shoving Miu hastily to the side in his efforts to get past her. In her new forceful stumblings at the edge of the pool, along with an added quick, unseen poke in the back from a nonchalantly whistling Kokichi, Miu ends up crashing straight into the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s left staring openmouthed at the display as the rest of her classmates hurry past the spectacle of Miu’s sudden flailing to gather around Kirumi’s side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Of the new arrivals, Gonta’s the first there and immediately breaks into tears. “Kirumi,” he says between sobs. “G-Gonta is so sorry—Gonta wasn’t strong enough to protect you. Gonta should have—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, it’s okay, Gonta,” says Angie. “It’s sad that Kirumi’s gone, but you can still pray to God for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta can?” he asks, looking at her with a new found hope. Somewhere in the distance, Kaede hears Miu let out a choice string of unanswered curses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course!” says Angie, resting a reassuring hand on his arm. “If everyone works together to pray, then God will totally let Kirumi into heaven, and everything will be okay, and you won’t have to be sad anymore. God will be with you and Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” he says, clasping his hands together with renewed determination. “Gonta will pray extra, extra hard for Kirumi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie beams. “God’s super glad to hear that, Gonta!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns, “Gonta, you don’t need to…” before shaking his head. Kaede, alone, hears him mumble out, “Forget it,” under his breath before pulling his hat down and turning away from Angie and her new disciple.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a step towards him when Kaito suddenly appears at her side, breathing still labored from his earlier sprint around the school. She looks up to his narrowed eyes and tightly clenched jaw. Kaede opens her mouth and he cuts her off immediately. “Don’t,” he says. “There’s no point in getting weepy or blaming yourself or shit… We just have to power through and do whatever comes next.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods, “right.” Then, her eyes slide back to Kiibo, kneeling completely silently next to Kirumi’s body while everyone hovers and chatters in their own private horror around him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without a word to Kaito, she approaches him, but, again, he speaks first. “I’ll go help Miu out of the pool,” he says, no emotion tinting his robotic voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stands and walks away from the gathered group without another word to help the spluttering Miu escape the pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, so,” Tsumugi says, her timid voice cutting through the chatter. “What do we do now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why you investigate!” cheers Monokuma suddenly appearing from nowhere, followed by his remaining cubs. “Because it’s time for round two!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko pouts. “We’re going to have to do another trial? But the first one was so hard…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces. “This isn’t a choice is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope, nope, nope!” he responds. “Weeeeell, I guess you could choose not to investigate and let the killer get away, and then I would get to show off my super cool mass punishment…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Gonta doesn’t like the sound of that,” he says hurriedly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oooh,” says Monokuma. “But one of you here definitely does! In fact, they’re probably just tingling with excitement at the idea of getting out of here right now! Ah, the joy of committing a murder and being completely unsuspected…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, so there’s another killer in the group,” says Kokichi brightly. “This is so exciting! Ooh, I wonder who it could be…” he taps a finger to his chin. “I sure hope it’s Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Dripping wet at the side of the pool, most of the fight is drained from Miu, and she merely grumbles, “Leave me the fuck alone, you,” she sighs deeply, “I don’t know, midget cock-sucking horse monster.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Oh, wow, I’ve never been called that before!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slams his fists together. “Alright, that’s enough fucking around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, it better be,” says Monokuma. “Because each investigation has a time limit, and when I say it’s time to start the show, then it’s time to start the show!” His voice drops to something more insidious. “Whether you’re ready or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The pink Monokub seems close to tears. “How cruel—what a cruel thing for father to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says the one with glasses. “It’d take a real asshole to just go killin’ someone for no reason. Especially one of their siblins’ or somethin’.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The robotic one is completely silent as it emits a strange, threatening aura. Then the red Monokub, jumps up, “Al-alright, alright, that’s enough. Everyone’s happy, and no one’s going to kill anyone else, and we’re all the best of friends…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-AM-HAPPY-TO-HEAR-THAT,” Monodam says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” says Monosuke. “I’ve had enough of this cowerin’ in fear bullshit! I say we take a stand, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The robot bears continue bickering in the background as Kaede turns to face the group as a whole. “Alright, everyone,” she says, desperately quieting her own nerves. “What happened here is horrible, but there’s nothing we can do, but do it. So,” she pumps her fist, “we all need to work together to investigate. For Kirumi’s sake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stands, pulling Miu to her feet as he does so. “I agree. I don’t know why this happened—but my inner voice is telling me that I can’t just let myself be consumed by grief. We need to keep moving.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right,” says Tsumugi. “All of our lives are on the line… so we can’t let anything stop us from finding the truth and bringing Kirumi’s killer to justice. Ah!” she clasps her hands together. “I totally sounded just like a shounen hero, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “With all of us working together—” suddenly she spies a figure standing off from everyone else. She stutters on her next words as the figure’s piercing red stare drives straight into her. “—w-with everyone working together, we can pull through this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko steps forward from the rest of the group. “Well said. Now what should our first step be then?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie waves a hand in the air. “Ooh, Angie remembers there was a pool of blood in the gym! God says there has to be a clue there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta will help,” he says. “Gonta isn’t going to let any of his friends get hurt ever again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two run off without another word. Kaede finds herself automatically looking to Ryoma expectantly, but he merely pulls out a new candy cigarette from his pocket, seemingly very caught up in twisting it between his fingers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s voice is the next to cut through the room. “I’m going to fucking change.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks at her. “Dude, Miu, when’d you fucking get all wet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks her up and down slowly. “Oh, did you cast a rain spell or something? How didn’t I see that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi bursts into laughter, and Miu grinds her teeth together as she says, “Fuck all of you, scrawny, dickless virgins,” and stomps off out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well then,” Korekiyo says, voice rising above Kokichi’s continued giggling. “I believe the Monokuma File is usually the best place to start.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in affirmation. She pulls her backpack off her shoulders to grab her Monopad when her heart nearly stops. Because inside her backpack, she sees her own Monopad and only two Monokubs’ pads.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her sudden freezing in pure panic catches Tenko’s attention, and the other girl says, “Kaede?” but all Kaede hears is a roaring caught in her ears. She jerks her head up, and her eyes quickly dart from Korekiyo looking concernedly in front of her, down to Ryoma staring at his own Monopad, and finally to Maki’s silent form watching her like a hawk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes meet Maki’s own, and the secret assassin hiding among them all gives her the coolest gaze as Kaede feels herself beginning to break out in a cold sweat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s now hovering near her side, but it’s Korekiyo’s voice that pulls her back to reality again. He says, “Kaede? Is something wrong?” and Kaede remembers that she has to be the leader.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She swallows and prepares to take another crisis silently on herself. With a forced laugh she says, “Everything’s fine. Just didn’t see my Monopad for a second behind my spare vests.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” he says raising his eyebrows, though seemingly satisfied with her answer, returning to inspecting the file on his own Monopad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When Kaede is relatively confident he is no longer paying her the same focused attention, she whispers to Tenko, “We have a really big problem. But,” she glances around the room again. “We can’t talk now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pales, but nods jerkily in confirmation. Both girls turn to the Monokuma File, though Kaede’s brain is rushing rapidly over every possibility that comes to her, and—with a fresh corpse not feet from her—one sings bright with paranoia, far louder than the rest. She barely registers the words on the Monokuma File the first time she reads them as she thinks about a time when she left her backpack completely unattended in her room with one other person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She bites her lip, and pushes the thoughts down with a quick, half-confident, ‘why would Tenko possibly do that after giving me her video in the first place?’ The girl in question seems focused on her Monopad, and Kaede shakes her head to regain her focus, and lies to herself that she didn’t notice Maki’s sharp red eyes still trained almost soley on her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On her second read through, Kirumi’s fate becomes clearer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The victim was Kirumi Tojo, the Ultimate Maid. Her body received many cuts across primarily the arms and torso, and a final slash across her throat was the cause of death. Then, Kaede frowns as she sees Kirumi’s time of death marked as the frustratingly vague ‘night.’<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito is the first to complain. “‘Night?’” he parrots. “Didn’t we get an exact time for Rantaro’s death last time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We did,” says Korekiyo. “I believe Monokuma once mentioned something about attempting to keep things fair between us and the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Kiibo, still flicking through the file as best he can with his metal fingers. “The time of death is probably a very important clue to the killer’s identity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My thoughts exactly,” says Korekiyo, glancing up the rest of the remaining students. “I don’t presume anyone happens to have the ability to ascertain a time of death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows a lot about combat injuries,” she volunteers. “But not much about… death injuries. Neo-Aikido rarely—if ever—involves the death of one’s opponent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Unfortunately, it’s about the same for me. I never really stuck around the bodies much after I killed them.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at his comment. And the realization that, ‘Oh right, Ryoma’s a murderer,’ nearly blindsides her. Over her thoughts, Tsumugi says, “Oh, it’s times like these that I wish I had played more mystery games…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Looks like having someone around who could do that would just make things too easy, huh? Real shame we don’t have someone like a detective to help out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stiffens. “No, we don’t,” she says curtly. “And we obviously can’t find out what the time of death is right now, so let’s just move on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko raises her hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, Himiko?” prompts Tenko. “Do you have something to say?” She gasps. “Can you use your magic to discover the time of death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “I just wanted to say ‘not it’ for investigating the body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko suddenly jumps on the spot. “Don’t worry, Himiko, like Tenko said, she is very knowledgeable about combat wounds and will handle the investigation to her utmost ability. Actually,” she stands strong with one hand on her hip and another pointed in the vague direction of most of her male classmates. “For Tenko’s investigation, all boys must leave the area.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” squawks Kaito. “Why? I can’t do shit if I can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The Monokuma File said Kirumi received injuries all across her body, and Tenko will need to thoroughly inspect her wounds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So?” he persists. “I don’t get fucking queasy around blood or anything like that, so what’s the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki speaks up for the first time since entering the room. “She’s likely going to be undressing parts of her to better examine her injuries.” She shakes her head. “And I assume Tenko is hanging on to some ridiculous ideal about preserving Kirumi’s dignity even though she’s dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh,” Kaito stutters. “Well, erm,” he coughs. “Guess I could leave for a little while then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Thank you for your cooperation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “No fair, no fair! I want to see the corpse, too! I don’t care if she’s naked!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scowls. “Tenko will give all awful boys ten seconds to leave the room.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine, fine,” says Ryoma. “I’ll check out the gym, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to investigate the storeroom,” says Korekiyo. “That is where the last murder weapon came from, so perhaps it could shed light on this investigation as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two make to leave, and Kaito hangs back to tell Kaede, “I’m gonna see if I can round up a few alibis or witnesses or something so I’m not completely fucking useless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’d be helpful,” she says. “But don’t push yourself too hard, since,” she glances down at his leg. “You’re still hurt, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves his hand as he backs away from her, a slight limp noticeable to Kaede’s wary eyes. “Maybe, but the great Kaito Momota isn’t about to let a little thing like that hold him back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes at his grin, and waves him off while Tenko and Kokichi argue behind her. Kokichi hops back and forth from foot to foot, trying to get around Tenko and make a dash for Kirumi’s body. “I just want to look for a little while, Tenko! C’mon, let me see, let me see!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s countdown is almost at its end. “Four, three, two—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I hate to interject,” says Kiibo. “But do I need to leave the area as well?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi attempts to dart past Tenko, but she quickly lunges out and grabs him in some kind of inelegant choke hold.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The increasingly loud squabbling as Kokichi tries to bite at Tenko’s arm leaves Kiibo’s question to fall on deaf ears. Kaede says as reassuringly as she can, “You can stay if you want to, Kiibo, but I also understand if you’d want to leave. You and Kirumi were…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “I did consider her to be one of my closest friends here, yes. If anything,” he says. “That only makes me blame myself for not being able to stop this. Especially since I spoke to her before nighttime yesterday… which may have been the last time anyone besides her killer saw her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede perks up at his words. “You talked to Kirumi last night? Do you know what time it was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kiibo begins. “I think it was about twenty minutes or so before nighttime, and I was helping her sweep up around the second floor. Logically, it was still kind of a mess from the bug appreciation party—lots of dead bugs and dirt on the floor—but with Kirumi’s skill, we finished up pretty quickly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” says Kaede. “Did she say where she was going after that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pauses, attempting to recall the memory. “I believe… she said she was going to spend a little time putting away our cleaning supplies in her research lab and that she was going to reorganize some stuff there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” says Kaede. “Kiibo, would you actually mind inspecting Kirumi’s research lab? There could be clues there if that was the last place she went.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Understood. I will do my best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to turn away from her, when another thought bursts into Kaede’s mind and she grabs his arm. “Oh, also, Kiibo,” she says. “One more question. I don’t know if this is at all related to Kirumi, but what happened to you last night? Are you okay now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His face suddenly flushes pink. “Ah, y-yes, I am fine. I just seemed to have had a slight malfunction and ran to get Miu. Admittedly, I was probably a bit more panicked than I needed to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kaede. “Well, I’m glad you’re alright. Did Miu say what the problem was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She, ahem,” he looks distinctly embarrassed. “She said there was a lot of debris in one of my fans. I suppose my efforts at cleaning did have some repercussions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at his words. “Only one of your fans?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Yes. At least, she only mentioned one of them as being excessively dirty.” His face grows concerned. “Do you think this has something to do with Kirumi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It could just be a coincidence,” she says. “But it’s a little weird something like that would happen the same night she was killed…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s eyes light up. “Am I a clue?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, maybe,” Kaede answers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” he places both hands triumphantly on his hips. “After I inspect Kirumi’s lab, I will get a fuller report from Miu. And I will bring Kirumi’s killer to justice in no time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches him scurry to the exit, determination flowing through him anew. She lets herself smile just a little before a large splash from the pool behind her crashes through the room. Kaede only sighs, already expecting the sight of a now freshly soaked Kokichi emerging from the water’s surface with an overtly dramatic gasp for air.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s standing at the side of the pool brushing her hands off, while Tsumugi and Himiko curiously watch from behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Now treading water, Kokichi lets out an exaggerated, “Fine! I’ll leave!” He begins to sniffle. “I just want to help with the investigation, and everyone’s being so mean to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Whatever waterworks he’s attempting seem to get lost somewhere in the fact that he is already drenched, causing him to abruptly stop in his fake crying, frown for a moment, and then let out an annoyed sigh before swimming back over to the edge of the pool. He pulls himself out purposefully in front of where Kaede’s standing, and proceeds to shake his head back and forth like a dog.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t give him the satisfaction of flinching and just rolls her eyes. “You could use a towel, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi glances up at her, a wide smile crawling over his face. “I could. A towel is something you do tend to use when you’re in a pool, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Towels are things people use, Kaede. I don’t see how that’s weird. Anyway,” he trills, hoping to his feet. “I’m going to launch my new, cool, no-Tenko’s allowed investigation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You should probably dry off first,” offers Tsumugi. “You’re going to track water everywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He grins. “You’re right, Tsumugi. And if I did that, Kirumi’s ghost would probably get pretty mad at me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do not make fun of Kirumi like that!” shouts Tenko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi suddenly turns pale. “Oh no, am I going to get thrown again? I better run!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And he whips past Kaede, heedless of Tsumugi calling after him to be careful about running in a pool. “Especially after Miu tracked water everywhere!” she finishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head when a thought occurs to her. “Hey,” she begins. “That reminds me, Kirumi’s body is completely dry, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi and Tenko both frown, but hurry back over to the corpse. “It looks dry to me,” says Tsumugi. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Kaede says walking over to them, “I was just thinking about how easy it seems to be to fall into the pool, but I guess that didn’t happen to Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s cold voice catches her off guard again. “Of course not,” she says. “It’s in the rules that swimming isn’t allowed at nighttime unless you want to be killed by an Exisal. If Kirumi or her killer happened to fall in, then an alarm would have sounded.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives her a hard look, but says “So, that means Kirumi and her killer were very careful when they came here?” She frowns. “The pool seems like a really bad place to do anything that would require a lot of moving around or fighting because of the nighttime rule.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe the killer just snuck up on her then?” asks Tsumugi, kneeling down beside Kirumi’s body. “I mean,” she shudders, “if they caught her off guard and did it really fast, then they wouldn’t have had to worry about running around the pool or accidentally falling in.” She shakes her head, looking significantly paler. “This is horrible to think about. Poor, Kirumi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in agreement. “That’s why we need to keep searching, for Kirumi’s sake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-yes,” Tsumugi agrees before directing her gaze to Tenko. “Erm, Tenko? I’m… okay with blood, and I know quite a bit about clothing tears, so do you want help with,” she swallows, “the body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko tightens her jaw but nods before she kneels down next to her. “Tenko really hopes this is okay and doesn’t disturb the crime scene,” she mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut as a biting memory of herself standing before a corpse and being so very impressed at Shuichi’s calm, collected demeanor in examining the person she just killed. Kaede curses herself for a lot of things, particularly not paying as much attention as she should have to the procedure he detailed for how to investigate a body. With Shuichi, she had mostly been focused on how amazing she thought he was. And then she killed him, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But of course, with Rantaro, she had known every detail about his demise, and it had been her silent hand guiding Shuichi’s investigation. Tenko takes a deep breath to prepare herself for flipping Kirumi’s body back over, and Kaede tires desperately not to think about how discovering the answers to this crime would be a blind grope through the darkness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but look away when Tenko finally rolls Kirumi over. Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Tsumugi involuntarily flinch at the sight of Kirumi’s wounds. Kaede attempts to look again, and notices the dried blood pouring down her throat and over the front of her chest. More blood pokes out in thinner lines from cuts in her shirt along her arms and across her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko takes another deep breath and begins to unbutton the front of Kirumi’s shirt to get a better look at whatever wound they know lies under her high collar.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces and looks away again. Further away from the entrance, she spies where Himiko had wandered off to when Tenko had announced she was going to begin her examination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shuffles over to the smaller girl, noting quickly that Maki seems to have chosen to just coldly stare down at Tenko and Tsumugi as they start their grim task. She says, “Himiko, what are you—” before catching sight of something just in front of the other girl’s feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko stares with her eyes firmly fixed on a kitchen knife, the blade stained with thick streaks of blood. “This,” she says shakily. “Is probably the murder weapon, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede struggles to form words for a moment before crouching down next to it. “Ah, well,” she frowns. “The Monokuma File did say her cause of death was a slashed throat, and…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A knife,” Himiko says slowly. “Would probably do that…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you two mumbling about over there?” says Maki, suddenly materializing behind Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jumps slightly at her voice unexpectedly being much closer than she thought it had any right to be, while Himiko answers, “I found the murder weapon… unless it’s a decoy,” she juts out her bottom lip. “In which case I found a fake murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her. “You think it could have been planted here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs. “Maybe. I just think someone would probably wanna take the murder weapon with them, y’know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not necessarily,” Maki says. “A kitchen knife is pretty anonymous, and carrying around a bloody weapon is too likely to attract attention for any smart killer to try it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Himiko. “In that case I definitely found the real murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her near emotionless expression, Kaede thinks she can detect the slightest bit of pride radiating from her, and says, “This was a really good find, Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to Kaede, pausing a moment blankly before saying, “Yeah,” and nodding her head a few times. Kaede smiles at her again, and she scuttles over to Tenko and Tsumugi, the slightest embarrassed blush on her cheeks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Not wasting time staring after her, Kaede stands and looks at Maki watching her carefully. “Maki,” she says, “I suppose this is a bit late, but I wasn’t expecting to see you out of your lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No emotion crosses Maki’s face. “I wasn’t expecting to leave either, but then a corpse showed up.” She shakes her head. “I don’t really know what you think of me, Kaede, but I’m not the kind of person who would simply sit around when my life is on the line.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one here is,” she says, frowning at the implication.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs. “If you say so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Well, I guess I’m glad you want to work together, even if it’s only for a little while.” She glances down at the knife again, the title on Maki’s motive video flashing through her mind. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about knives, would you? Can’t imagine it’d come up a lot in your line of work…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki regards her for a moment before saying in the same, emotionless voice. “It doesn’t. Good children don’t play with knives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Erm, right,” Kaede says. “I suppose that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Any other questions or can I return to doing something actually useful?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs, but says with as much patience as she can muster, “Just one more. I know Kaito likes to hang out outside your lab, and I’ve never seen you return to the dorms during training, so you stay up pretty late, right? Did you happen to see anything on your way back to your room last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses, crossing her arms. A moment of silence passes, and she says, “Are you suspecting me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “No, I mean, that’s not why I asked you.” She crosses her arms in turn. “I just want to collect as much information as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that so,” Maki says. “Well, perhaps, I might have noticed something, but I think I’d prefer to keep it to myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” says Kaede, huffing. “I don’t suspect you. Now what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You being suspicious of me isn’t the problem,” she answers. “I, personally, am suspicious of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs. “I simply think giving every piece of information to someone who attempted to help the killer last time might not be the best idea. Forgive me for not falling in line with everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth forms a tight, thin line. She chooses her words carefully, and says, “If you purposefully choose to withhold important information, Maki, then the only person you’re helping is the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I wouldn’t want to be like you with Shuichi,” she says, and brushes past Kaede on her way back towards the body.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a moment to take in a deep breath and let it back out. She reaches up to straighten Shuichi’s hat, and forces herself to walk as nonchalantly as possible back to the others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hovers over Tenko and Tsumugi’s crouched forms, deliberately putting Himiko between herself and Maki.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The top of Kirumi’s apron has been undone, as has most of her shirt, and Kaede can clearly see a pattern of random, shallow slashes spilled out over her bare skin, and a light coat of dried blood running over almost the entirety of her visible torso. The cut on her throat is caked with dried blood, and Kaede finds it difficult to look directly at it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But almost more disturbing is the eerie silence falling over the first three girls, and Tenko’s face near frozen in absolute horror. Maki’s launched into pestering them to explain themselves, and Kaede spies a bloodstained Monokubs’ pad in Tsumugi’s hands. She says, “You found a motive video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is too stunned to speak, so Tsumugi stutters out, “i-it was hidden in her apron, and, um,” she bites her lip and looks over at Tenko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s the matter?” asks Maki. “Turn it on. It’s clearly important evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can see a slight sweat beading on Himiko’s forehead when she says, “Uh, maybe it’s an illusion. Maybe it’s fake evidence like the knife wasn’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances between the three of them, and Tenko looks up at her helplessly. Kaede says, “Whose is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi bites her lip again and presses to turn it on with a shaking finger.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The motive video for Tenko Chabashira: Ultimate Neo-Aikido Master begins to play.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Life immediately returns to Tenko, and she whips her head up to look at Kaede and Himiko standing above her. “Tenko swears she didn’t do it,” she says. “Tenko would never hurt Kirumi, and she never even saw her video before now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She staggers to her feet, and her voice is one of pure desperation as she says, “You have to believe Tenko. Please.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi stands as well. She mumbles, “I-I think I might go check on the others…” and scurries away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko calls after her, “Tsumugi! You have to—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She doesn’t have to do anything,” says Maki. “Especially blindly trust the current biggest suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rounds on her. “Tenko did not kill Kirumi,” she says, a new fierceness creeping into her voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms and begins to walk away. “I guess we’ll see, won’t we?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko moves to step after them, and Kaede reaches out to put a hand on her shoulder. “Let them go,” she says. Tenko turns back to her, her increasingly frantic worry painted clear across her brutally terrified face. And that makes Kaede abandon every thought she had about Tenko turning on her in a heartbeat. She squeezes her shoulder. “I know you didn’t do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko rubs her eyes with the back of her sleeve. “Thank you. Tenko promises she’s innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very quietly, and with a slight hint of discomfort, Himiko says, “We should keep looking for evidence.” Tenko’s eyes light up when she looks down at her. Himiko glances away, but says, “You know, to prove the video’s an illusion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko,” she says, her hands over her heart. “Thank you, so much. Tenko will not let you down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods again, and as much for her own reassurance as Tenko’s she says, “You already have an alibi for most of the night, since we were together, so we just need to figure out what time the murder occurred.” She pumps her fists. “And if it happened when we weren’t, then we’ll just have to prove that you still couldn’t have done it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has an alibi?” Himiko asks. “Oh, that’s really good…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Himiko,” says Tenko. “D-did you doubt Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko pauses, and then says, “I found a kitchen knife a little while ago. Does that prove Tenko’s innocent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko thinks. “Neo-Aikido does not use kitchen knives? So maybe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suppresses her sigh, and asks, “Did you find anything else about the body, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko mouths the words, ‘Tenko,’ while the girl in question answers, “Kirumi’s wounds are just like the Monokuma File said, and were likely caused by a knife or other sharp object. Tenko would guess that the number of slashes and the range of depths and angles suggest that Kirumi likely fought back against or dodged out of the way of her killer’s weapon before her death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Hmm, but that makes the location of the pool all the more strange, right? Kirumi fought with her killer, and nobody fell in the pool and nothing got wet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe stuff did get wet and they dried it?” asks Himiko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” says Kaede before a rather annoying thought occurs to her. “Hey, Himiko, I kind of hate to ask this, but could you go check to see if any of the towels look like they’ve been used?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure, as long as you don’t leave without me,” she says, and shuffles away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns back to Tenko as soon as Himiko begins to walk away, and asks, “Did you find anything else besides the video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Yes. One of Kirumi’s gloves is missing, and Tenko discovered blood under her fingernails, which is another sign that she bravely fought against her killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Blood?” says Kaede. “Do you think that means the killer got hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is a strong possibility,” Tenko says. “However, the only problem is that the only spots of blood are under Kirumi and,” she glances along the side of the pool to the murder weapon, “directly under the knife Himiko found.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe there was more blood and the killer used one of the towels to wipe it away?” Kaede asks. Internally, she thinks, is that what Kokichi was talking about?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko’s voice carries back to them, “All of the towels are there, and none of them looked used.” Standing next to them again, she says, “I even did the extra work of checking the hamper, and I didn’t see any.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at the idea of extra work being glancing over at an empty basket for two seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Excellent work, Himiko. By the way, did you happen to see one of Kirumi’s gloves while you were looking?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pouts. “I was supposed to be looking for a glove, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not necessarily,” says Kaede. “I mean, if it’s missing, it’s missing… though that’s really weird.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tenko says clapping her hands together. “Should we now begin the search for Kirumi’s missing glove?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will that lead us to the killer?” asks Himiko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, maybe?” says Kaede. “Oh! One second,” she reaches around and pulls her backpack off. With one quick, weighing glance at Himiko, she says, “Tenko, remember that problem I mentioned earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Can we talk about it now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks between them. “What’s happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, do not worry about Himiko, Kaede,” Tenko says. “We can trust her. Tenko has no doubts in her mind that Himiko is a trustworthy person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks down at Himiko’s blank face, and Tenko stage whispers, “As you can clearly see from Himiko’s expression, she is very happy at being included.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede debates the merit in questioning that statement for a moment, before shaking her head and pulling the remaining motive videos out of her backpack. “Anyway,” she says. “Earlier when I was looking for my Monopad, I realized that one of the motive videos I was carrying somehow went missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen. “What? Did—there’s no chance you just dropped it, isn’t there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “I don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were carrying motive videos around?” asks Himiko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she answers. “I had mine, Tenko’s, and Kaito’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls out the two remaining videos, and Tenko is practically radiating with nervous energy. “Which one’s gone?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll have to turn them on to see,” says Kaede. “Which is kind of why I wanted to wait for the room to clear out a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns. “But if the video Tenko got is right here, then why was her motive…” she puffs out her cheeks. “I don’t get it. Does this mean she’s innocent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My best guess,” Kaede says. “Is that she’s being framed. And it very well could be by whoever stole one of the videos I was carrying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But who even knew you had them in the first place?” Himiko asks dimly as Tenko moves to turn on one of the videos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “I don’t know,” quietly as Korekiyo’s motive video flicks to life.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh no,” says Tenko. “Kaede, if Korekiyo’s video is here, then one of the missing ones is a really, really bad one, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It… seems that way,” she says before turning on the other video.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is a pregnant beat of hesitation before Monokuma’s voice rings out to once again remind them that there is no one in the outside world who cares about Ryoma Hoshi. The color drains from Kaede’s face. She says, “Maki…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you think,” Tenko begins. “That Maki is the killer then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shoves the videos back into her backpack. “Maybe. Someone else always could have stolen it… and there’s still a chance it just fell out somewhere or isn’t related at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says, “Ryoma doesn’t have any friends?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko turns to her. “Th-that’s just what the video says. But, Himiko, do you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma’s in the gym, right?” she says. “Someone should say something to him… someone who’s good at emotion stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko falters. “Himiko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko glances up to one of the high windows. “Is the gym through there? If I had enough MP, I’d use a spell to lift us up to the window, but…” she shrugs. “I’m out for the day.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-right,” Tenko recovers. “Himiko has worked really hard during the investigation so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, yeah,” says Kaede looking up to the window. “That reminds me of something, actually, though. I’m not sure if it’ll help too much, but it might be useful to get a bird’s eye view of this room.” She points up to the other window. “If we go up to that room, we can probably get a better image of the scene of the crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns. “I can’t use my magic to lift us up there, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” says Tenko. “What room is that anyway? Tenko doesn’t think she’s ever been up there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins to lead them out of the pool. “It’s actually Ryoma’s research lab. I don’t think he ever went up there, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why not?” asks Himiko. “My lab’s real cool and stuff—even if it has a bunch of stuff for normal magicians instead of mages.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede briefly ponders how to go about answering that question. “Well,” she says. “The room’s kind of weird. But we should head that way anyway—see if we can meet up with Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On the path back to the school, Kaede reaches one hand up to wave as she sees Kaito jogging to greet them. “Hey,” he says. “Find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “A few things. You?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rubs the back of his head with one hand. “I talked to some people, but for most of the night no one saw jackshit or has an alibi.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unfortunately, that’s kind of to be expected,” Kaede sighs. “Oh, well. We’re heading up to Ryoma’s lab to try and get an overhead view of the pool. Want to come?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hell yeah,” he says, joining them in their stroll to the school. “I can fill you in on what little shit I did find.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So first,” Kaito begins. “I tried talking to the people in the gym and Tsumugi when she showed up a little later, and they were all completely useless. All of ‘em say they went to their rooms just before nighttime and didn’t leave till this morning. And none of them saw Kirumi after dinner either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Himiko. “That’s all true for me, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “Kaito! Apologize to Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For what?” he asks. “A testimony like that <i>is</i> useless. Kaede, back me up here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe later,” she says. “Did you find out anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He huffs but continues. “Uh, let’s see—I saw Kokichi running around soaking wet for some fucking reason. He was really annoying but basically implied the same thing as everyone else. Also he kept going on about how of course he wouldn’t go to the fucking gym at night because he’s not a rule breaker or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is against the rules to go to the gym at night,” says Tenko. “Which means anything that happened there, would have had to happen before nighttime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh shit,” Kaito frowns. “Forgot about that. Does that mean I need to go fucking ask everyone again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s probably fine,” says Kaede. “Especially since it’s unlikely the killer would just happen to give away what they were doing because you asked for a slightly different time frame.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“True,” he hums. “Alright, next was Korekiyo, and he said that he just went to do his normal creepy observations in the dorms for most of the night before going to bed after us. Which fucking blows, because I already knew all of that shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did he mention seeing anyone else leave or come back to the dorms?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just us and Miu and whatever the fuck happened with Kiibo last night,” Kaito says. “Oh, by the way, I found Kiibo banging on Miu’s door to try and ask about his repairs last night—apparently he didn’t even know the fucking details. And then all Miu said was that it was really fucking gross since he was full of dead bugs and shit from Gonta’s appreciation party.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pulls a face. “Gross. The party was two days ago, so that means Kiibo has been wondering around full of dead bugs for…” she shudders. “This confirms it—Kiibo is definitely an awful boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I found some dead bugs in my pocket this morning,” Himiko volunteers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko means, that such a thing could happen to anyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Smooth,” says Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Tenko can fight him, Kaede says. “Okay, and since the three of us were at training, that means the only person unaccounted for is Maki, and,” Kaede sighs, “I really doubt she’s going to feel like cooperating.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stiffens. “Tenko thinks that we should avoid Maki for the time being.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah…” Himiko mumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks at them. “Something happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll… tell you later. Ah,” says Kaede jogging the last few steps and away from Kaito’s questions. “Looks like we’re here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside Ryoma’s lab, Kaede immediately notices something off. The other three file in behind her, and Himiko puts a finger to her lip and says, “Uh, aren’t there usually nets in tennis?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everything is exactly how Kaede remembers first entering the room, with the distinct exception of the now missing net. She walks over to one of the poles were it was formerly hung up on. “You’re right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “What an amazing observation, Himiko!” in the background as Kaede runs her fingers along the remaining piece of cord wrapped around the pole, its end hacked at and frayed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kaito,” says Kaede. “Tennis nets are pretty strong, right? How hard would it be to cut one?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He approaches and immediately begins rubbing his chin with his hand. “They’re pretty tough—and I’m willing to bet the one’s here are probably even stronger to handle Ryoma’s swings.” He reaches out and runs his fingers along the top of the severed cord. “You probably could cut it though. ‘Specially since it seems like whoever did this one went apeshit on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From across the room, Tenko calls out. “There is no cord on this pole. If someone removed the net, Tenko assumes they simply untied it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Why would someone cut one of the cords, but not the others?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Good question. Maybe they just didn’t know how you should take a net down and figured it out halfway through or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be,” answers Kaede. “Also, where’s the net?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hums. “I don’t see it, but my powers of magical detection say it’s probably through that door,” and her small hand points towards the door to the shower room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grimaces. “That’s a pretty good bet. Dragging a whole tennis net around the school even at night is just asking to attraction attention, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, and they head through the door into the lab for the Ultimate Prisoner. Tenko and Himiko both stand agape at the sight. Tenko says, “What kind of place is this? Why would Ryoma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My personal theory is it’s Monokuma’s fucking joke or something,” says Kaito. “Guess we never really mentioned this place, since it basically just exists to taunt Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede walks over to the missing net haphazardly folded in the corner. “But the killer definitely knew about this place,” she says. Glancing over her shoulder, she calls out. “Everyone look around—there’s probably a lot of evidence here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think so?” asks Himiko. “Does your magic tell you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Kaede. “I guess something definitely tells me the killer was less concerned about cleaning this place up. They were probably betting on nobody coming here, since it’s so out of the way from the investigation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Tenko. “Tenko will get a better view of the crime scene below.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” says Kaito. “And I guess I’ll look around with Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko changes her mind. Kaito can look at the window, and Tenko will search with Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re pretty awful at flirting, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tch! J-just like an awful boy to imply something so crude.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets their arguing fade into the background as she runs her hands over the net. She finds the one severed piece of cord, but it offers no further explanations. Unfolding the net from its balled up form, Kaede notices that the other end of the net is slightly damp. She moves her hands across its length. A little more than half of the net is slightly damp.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns, and reaches up to absently fiddle with the brim of Shuichi’s hat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s got his head stuck out the window, but his voice calls out clearly, “You know what’s weird? There’s no fucking trail or spots of blood between Kirumi’s body and the knife. Like, absolutely nothing dripped blood or got moved.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks up from her own investigation of the sink. “Now that you mention it, Tenko does remember that. And she thought it was odd because the knife was so far away from the body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to weigh in when Himiko jumps back from one of the shower stalls. Tenko is immediately at her side as the small girl begins to tremble. “Himiko, are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She points a finger inside one of the stalls, and Tenko lets out a gasp. “Ah, Himiko, your investigation skills are amazing!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is it?” asks Kaito, Kaede joining him in peering around the two girls. “Oh shit! Is that a motive video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shoved up against the far corner of the shower, carefully placed to be hidden from anyone walking by, is another pristine Monokubs’ pad. Tenko calmly walks past Himiko and picks it up. Himiko lets out a slight noise of surprise when she does so. Tenko whips towards her, “Himiko? Is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, Tenko,” says Kaito pointing. “Behind you. Looks like there was something under the video. Looks like…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at the sight, and approaches to pick it up herself. “Kirumi’s glove…” she turns it over in her hands and almost drops it at the sight of a thin smear of blood on the inside of it. Kaede immediately goes about turning it inside out. “Why is there blood,” she asks, “inside of Kirumi’s missing glove?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why the fuck is her glove all the way up here?” asks Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, everyone,” says Tenko. “Tenko isn’t sure about the glove, but everyone should really watch this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with that Tenko turns the already playing Monokubs’ pad towards them, and the video for Kirumi Tojo: Ultimate Maid continues to play.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The four of them are stunned into absolute silence as the video details Kirumi’s exploits of reaching out to help the entire country and how absolutely everyone is depending on her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When the video finishes, Kaito says, “Holy fuck, someone killed the prime minister.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then a bell sounds that says it’s time for the trial to begin.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I hope everyone enjoys my attempt at making a semi-complex murder (though I know I'll likely never reach in-game levels of complexity, haha). Also, quick question, the trial is approaching next chapter and would people be interested in an attempt to incorporate the various mini-games involving talking to the other students into the chapter? I see positives and negatives to either approach, and am curious if there's a strong feeling for or against.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mind is racing when they begin the walk to the class trial. The last time she had made the journey, she had accepted that she was embarking on her own death march. But that had been the enemy she knew. Kaito, Tenko, and Himiko walk in front of her, the latter two finally filling him in on the details of their up close examination of their deceased friend’s corpse. Himiko noticeably leaves out the part about finding Tenko’s assigned motive video held tightly to Kirumi’s chest, and Tenko is even more noticeable in her hesitant correction.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods, taking in the information with an almost uncharacteristic grimness. “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks them over, silently assessing them from under the brim of Shuichi’s hat, and bites her lip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s made the choice to trust Tenko, but that was an easy choice. Tenko handed over her given motive video without a second thought. Tenko spent the majority of the night of the murder only inches from Kaede’s side. Tenko, herself, stood with her through the entire investigation, looking as hard and as earnestly as she could for evidence to corner the killer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko promises she didn’t do it,” she assures, and Kaito nods again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Of course, Kaede did the exact same thing to Shuichi. But she doesn’t think anyone else would be that cruel.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede readjusts the brim of Shuichi’s hat. Upon a second of closer observation, trusting Tenko is not the leap of faith she had made it out to be when they had stood over Kirumi’s bloody corpse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She lists off the people she knows couldn’t have done it. Herself. Tenko. Miu is one of the only people she knows isn’t the mastermind, and Kaede prays the other girl didn’t whip around from being her only potential ally to throwing her life away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko and Kaito, <i>maybe.</i> Kaede’s own paranoia threatens to eat her alive as the latter pushes open the doors of the school. The open morning air greets them, and Kaito says, “I know. You’re definitely fucking being framed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks up at him. “You believe Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course I do,” he says. “You might be kind of a pain, but you wouldn’t go and fucking do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko huffs. “Tenko is not a pain, but,” she frowns, a seriousness settling heavily over all of them as they near the landing to take them down to the trial. “Thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede silently wishes she had even a fraction of Kaito’s blind optimism as he finishes his sweeping encouragement. “No problem—but you better be ready, Tenko. You’re going to have to fight once we get down there, got it? Don’t let them drive you into a corner or nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Tenko understands, and she is prepared.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can use my magic to see if any accusations are illusions,” offers Himiko quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says with the utmost gravity, “Thank you, Himiko. Tenko will be counting on you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins, and without another word, he leads the way boldly to the landing, the others already gathered. Tenko takes a breath, tightening her resolve before following him and Himiko nervously shuffling behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede centers Shuichi’s hat on her head and readies herself to play the role she was never meant for. She claps her hands to focus everyone’s attention on her. “Alright, everyone here? Good,” she says, eyes carefully avoiding Maki’s stoic form off in the corner. “Now I understand that everyone is probably really nervous. Honestly, I’d be worried if everyone wasn’t, because plainly,” she takes a deep breath, “this shouldn’t have happened. We shouldn’t be here, and the fact that we are means I have failed you, and it doesn’t matter how much I apologize for that because it will never be okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sees Kaito take a step towards her, but no one says a word. Kaede straightens her shoulders and continues. “Kirumi should not have died. And I take responsibility for not doing enough to stop this. However, for her sake—in order to find some justice for her—and for everyone’s lives, we all have to work together. Maybe you don’t like me,” she dares to say next words straight to Maki. “Maybe you hate me or don’t trust me, but right now we plainly have no other options. So,” she pumps her fists, “let’s do everything we can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not a surprise that Kaito’s the first to speak, “Took the words right out of my mouth—I’m with you all the way, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I agree. If everyone works together,” he smiles, “I know we can avenge Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we can not fucking die,” says Miu. “But, yeah, whatever, friendship and all that crap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, well if Kaede says it,” says Kokichi. “Then it must be true!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Except for you,” Miu amends. “You can fucking die. First thing in the goddamn morning and I get shoved into a fucking pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a dark look. “Kirumi was also found dead this morning. Don’t think that’s more important?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-well, yeah,” she says. “B-but th-that doesn’t mean I didn’t get all wet! And not in the good fucking way like usual every morning, so don’t even—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, pig,” says Kokichi. “Shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“P-pig!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The elevator’s here,” Maki observes coolly. “I suggest everyone finishes their inane conversations quickly. I doubt Monokuma will wait forever.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She quietly enters the elevator, and Kokichi skips after her. “Ooh,” he cheers. “This is going to be so much fun!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu hurries after him. “The fuck are you going? You can’t just call me a pig and run off, you pasty ass virgin!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, he’s just going to the elevator?” Tsumugi muses quietly, walking pointedly slower after them. “Ah, well, I just hope they stop fighting when the trial actually starts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do as well, Tsumugi,” says Korekiyo, stepping into pace next to her. “It would be quite irksome to waste time with needless bickering when everyone’s lives are at stake.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta approaches Kaede as Kiibo voices his agreement, entering the elevator as well. “Ah, Gonta had something he wanted to say really fast if there’s still time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” says Kaede. She glances over his shoulder to give a quick nod to Tenko and Kaito to go on ahead. Turning back to him she says, “What do you need?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shifts nervously. “Gonta’s kind of an idiot so he’s probably not going to be very helpful,” he says. “But Gonta also wants Kaede to know he’s going to try his very best, especially since it’s mostly Gonta’s fault that… that we’re here again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “Gonta, unless you’re the culprit, you had nothing—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “Gonta really liked your speech, but he knows what happened to Kirumi is also his fault. Gonta,” he takes a deep breath, “really, really wants to protect his friends, and he just keeps failing. He couldn’t protect Kirumi or Rantaro or Shuichi, even though he said he would.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth forms a tight line. It’s the two of them, and out of the corner of her eye, she catches Ryoma hanging just outside the elevator’s entrance, listening in. “Gonta, listen to me. Sometimes things happen that are absolutely awful and are absolutely outside of your control. And you can’t constantly blame yourself for those things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, Kaede, you said it was your—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know what I said,” she interrupts. “And,” she grimaces, “my situation is complicated. All I’m saying is that you can’t beat yourself up over what you didn’t do or what you should have done. Because,” and she reaches out to place a reassuring hand on his arm. “You couldn’t have known. And you can’t fault yourself for not being psychic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods slowly. “G-Gonta knows. Gonta just,” he shakes his head. In a horribly small voice, “Gonta just wants to help and feels like he can’t do anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words resonate deep within Kaede’s core. “I know. I really, really know. So,” she pumps her fist. “We’ll just have to keep moving forward and try even harder. Together, okay? Promise me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta promises,” he says. “Gonta will do his absolute—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you guys fucking coming or what?” Miu’s voice calls out to them. “This elevator’s about to go down on this bitch, with or without you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs, but turns to Gonta with her best encouraging smile. “Guess we better get going.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” he says. “Thank you, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” she says, and the two walk to the elevator.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta makes his way to the back, and Ryoma files in behind Kaede. Very quietly under the ambient murmur of the others he says, “That was real nice of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, thanks,” she says. “I have to admit it was for him as much as for myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “That’s fair, also,” he eyes Shuichi’s hat atop her head. “You actually plan on keeping that promise about not blaming yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a humorless laugh, reaching up to her run her fingers over the brim. “No, not really. Just between you and me, I’m a pretty big hypocrite.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your secret’s safe with me,” he says. “Just don’t let Gonta catch on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t plan on it,” she says, and Ryoma takes a step to distance himself from her before the elevator starts to move.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">And silence, thick and heavy, presses over them as the elevator hums happily in their deep descent. But the inside of Kaede’s head roars with sound. They had failed in the last trial, but yet here they all were, lined up to find another murderer among their friends. Kaede takes a deep breath. Two trials in, and they’d still yet to find one murderer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The space beside her remains painfully empty with no Shuichi to encourage and push forward and buildup and then throw down to save herself. They reach their destination and slowly fill their respective podiums, primed for them to sentence someone to death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands at her own between Gonta and Himiko and looks across the way to see Kaito is now suddenly flanked on either side by portraits of the dead. The X on Shuichi’s portrait runs jagged and uneven, widening at the top to block out his one visible eye completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s no time to collapse under the weight of her own guilt, however, as Monokuma from up on his throne begins to speak. “Alrighty then! I’m sure you all still remember the rules of the class trial from last time,” he says. “But in case you somehow managed to forget, one person here among you is a murderer! And if you can figure out who, then I get to give them a very special punishment but,” he brings his tiny paws up to his mouth, “if you don’t… then I get to punish everyone else instead, puhpuhpuh! Either way, I win! So get to it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede seizes the first word in the brief moment of hesitation that falls over everyone. “Alright, everyone, I think the simplest way to do this is for everyone to say where they investigated and share their findings so we can all work with the same information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Gonta begins. “Gonta went to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what should we start with?” Kokichi says, bouncing on his heels. “I say we accuse someone and see where we go from there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta blinks at him. “Oh, but Kaede just said we should start with sharing, so Gonta—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves his hand. “Nah, that’s boring. I say we accuse someone! That always gets the ball rolling.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites back the irritation already welling up inside her. “Ignoring for a moment that I’m the leader and I already proposed how we should begin,” she says. “Isn’t starting with an accusation a bit much?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” says Kiibo. “Logically, we should begin with the facts we do know first before—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think Kiiboy did it!” Kokichi announces.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wh-wh—Me!?” Kiibo shouts before thrusting a finger in Kokichi’s direction. “This-this is just more of your discrimination against robots, isn’t it? B-but to be accused of murder just because—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because you were wandering around at night weirdly for no reason?” Kokichi asks tilting his head to the side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You little brat,” Kaito says. “You were fucking listening in on our conversation, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves his hand. “Details, details. Point is he was acting suspicious, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stutters, “I-I admittedly was out at night, but that does not mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi turns to Monokuma. “Hey, hey, last time you said I almost broke the record for fastest trial. What happens if I do it this time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, wow,” Angie says. “Are we done already? That was so fast! Even God’s impressed!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I guess Kiibo did do it,” Himiko yawns. “Good, I wanted time to nap before lunch anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-wait, Himiko,” Tenko says. “It is important that you are well rested, but we cannot jump to conclusions about this!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “You’re all interrupting. I wanna know about the record for fastest trial!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone, please stop!” shouts Kiibo. “I am not the culprit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiiboy,” Kokichi says, examining his fingernails. “I’m trying to ask Monokuma a question. It’s rude to interrupt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is also rude to recklessly accuse me of murder!” he says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not reckless, though,” Kokichi says. “Here, I’ll sum up what happened, and then we can vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks as Kokichi launches into his explanation. Last trial, she had already known all the answers going in. Now, she feels herself moving through the dark, and her control of the situation is already rapidly falling away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “First, Kiiboy met Kirumi at the pool. Then he killed her and ran outside. He was really dumb and clumsy about it and made a lot of noise, scaring Miu, who was leaving her lab. He easily fooled Miu by faking a malfunction, endured having to be around a gross pig like her for a little while, and then went back to his room.” He grins up at Monokuma. “Is that right? Am I right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing about that was right!” Kiibo shouts. “Just because I was outside at night does not mean I am the killer.” He places a fist over his chest. “You cannot declare someone is a murderer on such baseless theories alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds her voice. “Kiibo is right. We shouldn’t suspect him—or anyone else for that matter—unless we have proper evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why not?” Kokichi asks. “This is a class trial, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yes,” she responds, furrowing her brow. “But we should still believe in people first before we doubt them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “The rule here is guilty till proven innocent.” He gives her an odd look over Himiko’s head. “And even then that sometimes isn’t enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She knows it’s a threat against her. Kaede pulls Shuichi’s hat down lower over her eyes. But this isn’t about her. “Think what you want,” Kaede says, steeling herself against him as much as her own paranoia, “but I’m going to choose to believe until there’s proper evidence. And right now I believe Kiibo is innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kiibo gasps. “Thank you, Kaede. I promise that I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “You know what? I fucking believe in you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo and Kirumi were close friends,” Tenko adds. “Tenko doubts he would ever hurt her, so Tenko also believes in him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi!” Miu barks. “If anyone’s going to fucking believe in Kiibo, it’s me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The robot is taken aback. “Everyone… you all—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are ignoring your plainly suspicious behavior,” Kokichi says. “All the belief in the world doesn’t mean someone’s not a murderer.” His eyes slide to Kaede again. “Sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clenches her fists. “Kokichi if you have a problem with me, that’s fine, but you shouldn’t accuse my friends just because you don’t like me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he clicks his tongue. “Kaede, this isn’t all about you, y’know. This is about Kiiboy and his clumsy, incompetent murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo did not murder anyone,” Kaede says. “I know he didn’t.” She gives Kokichi a long look. “And I think you know he didn’t either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what’s your evidence?” Kokichi asks. “C’mon! Show me your evidence, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches up to fiddle with the bill of Shuichi’s hat. She furrows her brow and thinks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo begins, “I admit that I was outside during the time of the murder, but that does not mean I killed Kirumi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Cleary, Kiiboy is the most suspicious person here,” Kokichi smiles. “Except he’s not a person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please stop discriminating against me!” he shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, Kiibo,” Kaito interjects. “You gotta stay focused if you want to beat this brat. Did you run into anyone when you were outside or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes!” he responds. “I ran into Miu almost immediately!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking scared the shit out of me, too,” Miu says. “What’d you do? Fucking go Godzilla apeshit on that branch?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I apologize for that again, even if I do not remember doing such a thing!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you apologize to Kirumi before you killed her?” Kokichi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi! Do not say things like that!” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiiboy! Do not kill people like that!” Kokichi mimics back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kiibo,” Kaede says. “I know you’re not going to be happy about this, but Kokichi’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, I am?” he smiles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What!?” Kiibo shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like fucking hell he’s right about jackshit!” says Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She quickly shakes her head. “He’s not right about Kiibo being the killer, but he is right that, well,” she fiddles with the brim of her hat. “You’re not a person, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Kaede!” he says, mouth gaping open. “I have come to expect this from Kokichi, but you too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Tenko thinks she understands!” she interrupts. “Kaede, you mean Kiibo is not a human, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow, Tenko, too?” Kokichi laughs. “Man, Kiiboy, you’re getting bullied hard. I feel so bad for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But… you were the one who just accused him of murder,” Tsumugi mumbles. “Repeatedly.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says. “What Kaede simply means is that this is a crime that could have only been committed by a human.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That’s right. Tenko and I investigated Kirumi’s body at the crime scene. When we were examining her, we noticed that one of her gloves was missing, and there was blood under her fingernails.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which,” Tenko chimes in. “Is a telltale sign that Kirumi fought back against her killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Think I get it. The blood under her fingernails belongs to the killer, and since Kiibo can’t bleed, he can’t be the one who attacked Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo points a finger at Kokichi. “Which means it is impossible that I killed Kirumi! So stop accusing me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unless your oil looks like blood,” Kokichi says. “Ooh, ooh does it? Does it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you, I do not run on oil!” Kiibo says. “And no, none of my mechanical fluids look anything like human blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu speaks up. “There isn’t a whole lotta fluid in him anyway. I mean, I was fucking working him hard last night and barely a drop came out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “That is correct.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “He’s just totally oblivious to it, isn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-anyway,” Kaede stutters. “The point is that since he’s a robot, it’s impossible for Kiibo to be the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that so?” Maki asks, speaking up for the first time since the trial began.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re making some leaps in logic,” she says. “You said the blood has to belong to the killer. But how do you know? It’s suspicious that Kirumi just happened to have one of her gloves missing, so the evidence could easily have been something we were meant to find.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh,” coos Angie. “You’re saying it was planted by the killer?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “Maki makes a good point. If Kiibo is the culprit, he easily could have simply used Kirumi’s blood to fake that evidence and make us dismiss him like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” Kokichi says. “I don’t think he’d think ahead like that. Kiiboy’s not that smart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, do not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I think we can trust it,” says Kaede. “Especially if we all think about where we eventually did find Kirumi’s glove.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You found the glove?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns at her. “Weren’t you investigating the body with them?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I was,” she says. “But I left to join you in the gym before that, so I… wasn’t there for that part. Sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh wait,” drawls Himiko. “I was there… and I think I remember… feels like it happened just yesterday or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “That’s ‘cause it happened like fifteen minutes ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” scolds Tenko. “Do not insult Himiko! Please apologize for your behavior.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bullshit! I didn’t fucking do anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh! Fight, fight, fight!” cheers Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You shut the fuck up, too!” Kaito shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “Oh no… did I make my beloved Kaito angry at me? Don’t get mad—it’s probably all Kiiboy’s fault anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“St-Stop randomly accusing me of things,” the robot says, the fight draining from his voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko claps her hands. “All terrible boys be quiet and listen to Himiko.” She glances to the smaller girl, still thinking hard. “She has something very important to add to our debate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi mumbles, “I’m not sure if you can call what just happened a debate…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I remember now,” says Himiko, tapping a finger to her chin. “It was hidden in that weird room, right? Why was it up there anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with the bill of Shuichi’s hat. “I’m… not quite sure about that yet… but,” she says, finding her confidence anew. “It was really out of the way of the rest of the crime scene, and it was hidden under,” she debates her next words, “something the killer probably would’ve wanted to get rid of if they had noticed it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” asks Kokichi. “What’s this mysterious something? Keeping secrets, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also what is the ‘weird room,’ if you don’t mind Gonta asking,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll…” she begins, “clear those things up in a minute, but they’re not important right now. But my point is that from its arrangement in the place we found it, there’s good reason to suspect that Kirumi’s glove was something she hid from the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, to sum up,” says Korekiyo. “If that is in fact the case, and the placement of Kirumis’ glove was something that was done by her rather than her killer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then God says we can trust the glove!” says Angie. “And that means we can trust Kirumi’s hands, too! And Kiibo!” She clasps her hands together. “God is being so trusting again—congratulations on not being the culprit, Kiibo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “Uh, thank you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says you’re welcome!” she replies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” sighs Ryoma. “Let’s stop ignoring that planting precise evidence like blood under someone’s fingernails would be stupid hard unless you were a trained murderer or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends a wary glance to Maki out of the corner of her eye. The other girl doesn’t even so much as blink at his words. In the background of Kaede’s now racing thoughts, Kiibo says, “I can assure you I am not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it’s like I’ve been telling you guys from the beginning,” says Kokichi. “Kiiboy’s not that smart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop saying that…” Kiibo says, defeat creeping into his voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the killer’s not Kiiboy, buuuut,” Kokichi hums. “I get a second try, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns in confusion, while Kaito asks for her, “Second try at what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guessing the killer, of course!” he says. “Okay, so—new theory—how about this? Everyone loves Kirumi, right? And when she died, everyone was sad it wasn’t someone they hated, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” gasps Gonta. “How can you say that? Gonta’s friends with everyone, so he’d be sad if anyone died, and,” his face falters, “and Gonta assumed everyone else felt the same way, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well there’s the problem!” says Kokichi. “You can’t just assume things like that. And, I guarantee you that more than a few people here were at least a little happy when they found the body that it wasn’t someone they liked more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi covers her mouth with a hand. “What a horrible thing to say—you’re horrible!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks ready to throw him across the courtroom. “Tenko has met many terrible boys before, but this goes beyond even the normal atrocities of being a man.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Calm down,” says Ryoma. “Getting angry at each other isn’t going to solve anything. And, even though Kokichi’s purposefully phrasing it to instigate you, the point he’s making isn’t wrong.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta gives the smaller boy a betrayed look. “Ryoma… when you saw Kirumi’s body, you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “This is less about me and more about being human. I guess an example would help here,” he fiddles with his cigarette. “Let’s see… say you heard there was a fire in a place where a family member worked. A news report comes out, and you hear that lots of people have died, but then you get a call and here that your family member is perfectly fine. What would your first reaction be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” says Kaede slowly. “You’d be pretty relieved…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” says Kaito rubbing the back of his head. “That’s kinda the fucking point behind this motive, isn’t it? To you, your family or whoever’s on the video’s way more fucking important than everyone else here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” says Ryoma. “So, Gonta,” he turns to him, “all Kokichi’s saying is stuff we already knew—you’re still friends with everyone, and everyone is still upset about Kirumi. Nothing’s changed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The taller boy looks startled. “G-Gonta gets it now.” He starts to smile again. “Thank you, Ryoma! Gonta is glad he has a friend like you around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his hat. “Don’t mention it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, Ryoma totally ruined my dramatic reveal,” Kokichi whines, before huffing and crossing his arms. “It’s going to be completely boring now. Oh well, I guess it can’t be helped.” He folds his arms behind his head. “By the way, my next guess is Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me!?” she squawks. “What the fuck did I do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, like I was trying to say earlier,” he says. “Everyone loved Kirumi except for one person, so, that person is the most likely to try and randomly stick a knife in her, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t stick anything in that frigid, limp-titted, bitch if you paid me!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses her hands to her temples. “Miu, you’re really not making a good case for yourself.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck ever!” she shouts. “I didn’t do it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “Can you prove that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not the goddamn killer!” Miu yells.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu was also out late at night yesterday,” Korekiyo offers. “I remember seeing her leave the dorms just after nighttime, and if I recall correctly, I never saw her return.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“S-so what?” she stutters. “I-I always go out at night!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scratches the back of his head. “Were you really doing something as dumb as hanging out outside by yourself all fucking night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-actually I just remembered!” she shouts. “I-I didn’t go to my lab last night. I just, uh, just left the dorm and then came back inside while the gimp wasn’t looking! Didn’t go fucking anywhere all night!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Man, it’s been a while since I heard a lie that bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Miu, you really shouldn’t tell unnecessary lies like that, especially since you do have an alibi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I do!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “You’re acting too surprised about that for someone who’s innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” says Kaede. “Korekiyo said he saw you leaving right when nighttime started, and you and Kiibo were together for most of the night, right? Do you remember what time you got back to the dorms?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was real fucking late,” she says. “Or real fucking early. I dunno. Real fucking something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” says Kiibo, thinking hard. “Believe we returned to the dorms sometime around three or four in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shit man,” says Kaito. “And you guys met up at like eleven or something? That is a long fucking time to spend with Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You guys,” says Himiko. “Were alone together for four or five hours… what were you doing for that long?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cackles. “Well I can tell you what we weren’t doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo looks uncomfortable. “I believe that is my fault. Miu had to spend quite a bit of time fixing one of my fans. I suppose I let my maintenance of it slip.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just one of your fans?” asks Tenko. “What did you do to get only one fan dirty enough to cause a malfunction? Tenko doesn’t know a lot about machines but…” she frowns. “That’s strange isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is…” says Kaede. “And it just happened to happen the night of Kirumi’s murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It,” Gonta tries. “Is probably not a coincidence then? I-is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d say so,” says Ryoma. “How about it, Miu? Find anything weird?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo turns bright red, and mumbles, “This is so embarrassing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “I found something real fucking gross.” She tosses her hair over her shoulder. “Let me tell you, nothing fucking ruins the mood more than openin’ up a robot to clean and finding a shitton of dead bugs crammed into him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta gasps. “D-dead bugs? How could something that horrible happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would hazard a guess that the appreciation party likely had a hand in it,” says Korekiyo. “There were many insects flying around, and I believe Gonta has stated there are no bugs anywhere else, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, God says that sounds rights,” says Angie. “Angie also totally ate a bug, so maybe the same thing happened to Kiibo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta slumps his shoulders. “Gonta is really sorry about the party…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no, none of you fucking get it,” says Miu. “Like, I popped Kiibs’s fan open and there was just like an entire fistful of the little fuckers shoved inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “‘A fistful?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fuck were you guys doing at that party anyway?” Miu continues. “Did Kiibs end up rolling around on the ground or dive head first into a pile of ‘em or some shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can assure you I did no such things,” says Kiibo. “All I did at the party was sit quietly with Kirumi, and then…” he glances at Kaito. “And then I attempted to help catch Kaito later, which, ah…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “You… tried. I guess.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My apologies again,” he responds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“To stay focused,” says Korekiyo. “I believe neither of those activities would result in an abnormality like the one you described. Is that correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But even if Kiibo did jump head first into a pile of bugs,” says Himiko absently. “I thought you said it was just one fan? The insect storm was pretty big. Even with my magic I wasn’t able to stop them from getting everywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “So it’s definitely strange that only one of Kiibo’s fans would be full of bugs! Himiko, you’re a genius!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pauses. Then, with the same blank expression, “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, that’s a good point!” says Angie. “Hey, Miu, was there bug paste anywhere else on Kiibo or just in the one spot?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-bug paste?” Gonta echoes, near scandalized at the idea.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” says Miu. “After I found the big problem I had to work him over completely to see if there was any other crap wrong. And I worked him all night long, from top to bottom, every inch—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And did you find anything?” asks Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eh,” she says. “Some shit here and there, but nothing like the spot that made him freak the fuck out. Seriously,” she turns to Kiibo. “You scared the absolute shit out of me last night. Just fucking walking back to my room, minding my own damn business, and suddenly there’s a cracking noise like fucking God slammin’ his car door, and you’re, like two inches from me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems to pout. “I was not that close. And I also did not step on a branch like you keep insisting. My path finding skills would never allows for such a mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, so you were planning to just fucking sneak up on me?” she says. “Well, thank God for the branch then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “I don’t think you listened to what I just said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sooo,” drawls Kokichi, looking at his fingernails. “Now that we’ve sufficiently talked in circles about Kiiboy’s bad hygiene, can somebody give me the short version of what was important? I wasn’t listening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re actually the worst, aren’t you?” mutters Kaito darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede starts thinking, and Kokichi sends her another look over Himiko’s head. “So, like, what’s actually important about Kiiboy? Or is he just looking for attention?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am doing no such thing!” says Kiibo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s important about Kiibo’s incident,” says Kaede slowly. “Is that… he,” her eyes widen at her own realization. “He was sabotaged. Someone—” she looks out over all of the suddenly nervous face before her. “Someone sabotaged Kiibo, which caused him to suddenly run outside last night. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sabotage!” Angie gasps, pressing her hands to her cheeks. “Ooh, God says this is a really big clue!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo looks taken aback. “Someone… someone purposefully…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-but, Kiibo’s alright now, right?” asks Gonta. “He’s okay, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m,” Kiibo stares blankly ahead. “I’m fine. I just want to know who… who would do such a thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scoffs, and all attention turns to her. “The killer, obviously. It’s ridiculous to think it was anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth, then clenches her jaw. Crossing her arms, she begins to think hard again, and the others keep talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only person who would logically sabotage Kiibo,” says Maki. “Is the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Poor Kiibo…” says Gonta.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, well,” adds Tsumugi. “Who would know how to do that in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles brightly. “I-R-U-M-A-chan! You’re up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She splutters. “I-I-I don’t fucking know anything about computers! Th-the fuck are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now that was an impressively bad lie,” muses Korekiyo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” says Kiibo. “I don’t want to think you’d do something like this, but you’re the only person here who knew about my fans and the only one who would ever haven gotten close enough to do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“K-Kiibo!” she says. “C-c’mon! I-I’d never do something like that! You have to believe me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaede. “Kiibo, you’re forgetting. There’s someone else who knew about your fans. In fact, that person told me about them the morning before your incident. And…” she takes a breath, “and they definitely could have gotten close to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He blinks. “Who?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi,” she says. “Do you remember? Yesterday morning when you were helping clean the kitchen, she mentioned how you needed to be careful about getting too dirty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko speaks up. “If it matters, Tenko also remembers seeing Kirumi helping Kiibo pick bugs out of him at the appreciation party, which means she is probably the most likely person to know about such things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” says Kiibo. “Did mention that it to her then when I asked for her help…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, guys,” says Kaito. “Like, that all sounds true and shit, but—uh,” he jerks a thumb at the portrait next to him. “Kirumi’s dead. She can’t be the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Kokichi hums. “That would certainly seem true, yet here we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “D-did Kirumi come back as a ghost—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no fucking ghosts!” shouts Kaito a touch too hastily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, what if she did? What if she did?” asks Angie. “After her death, Kirumi’s ghost came back to sabotage Kiibo to get everyone’s attention about what happened to her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or—to talk about something that’s not impossible,” says Ryoma. “Why don’t we think about a real time when Kirumi could’ve done something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That might be difficult,” says Korekiyo. “If I’m not mistaken, Kirumi and Kiibo usually spent quite a bit of time together during the day. Which means, assuming she is the one responsible, she could have done it at any time, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” says Himiko. “I don’t think that’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her. “Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah-ha!” says Tenko. “This is the part where Himiko uses her magic to find the truth!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The smaller girl frowns. “Kirumi wasn’t a mage or anything, so she probably just used a normal sleight of hand, like a fake magician would. ‘Cause if Kiibo noticed, then he would’ve stopped her or something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That’s actually a good point. Kiibo, did you notice Kirumi acting suspicious or odd at any point when you were cleaning with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure,” he says. “But,” he frowns. “It was likely late in the day… if it was earlier, I would have probably had my malfunction then rather than during nighttime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko taps a finger to her chin. “You two were probably alone or around only one or two other people. The more angles people watch a sleight of hand from, the more likely they are to be caught.” She lowers her hat. “That’s what separates normal magicians from real mages.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko squeaks. “Ah! Himiko is so cool!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm,” says Angie. “So Angie just finished asking God, and he says that Kirumi definitely did it right before nighttime. What do you think Kiibo?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… did spend time with her about twenty or so minutes before nighttime began,” he says. “And no one else was around… and we were sweeping up dead bugs in the hall from the appreciation party.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m going to assume that settles it then,” says Korekiyo. “However, I fear this only raises more questions, does it not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Why would Kirumi do something like that? Are,” he looks out at everyone. “Are we sure it was Kirumi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well I didn’t fucking do it just to make myself clean it up again,” says Miu. “Ugh, just thinking about that nasty shit makes me wanna blow chunks.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Miu’s the only other person who knew about Kiibo’s fans and had a chance to do something about it,” says Kaito. “But… Kirumi’s still dead? So,” he frowns. “What the fuck is going on here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Good question, Kaito. Personally, I say we move on and address something Kaede’s been hiding from us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Hiding?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Earlier, when we were first talking about how Kiiboy’s obviously not the killer, you mentioned finding Kirumi’s hidden glove under a mysterious something in a mysterious place,” he smiles. “Care to elaborate on either of those things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She reaches up to pull at Shuichi’s hat, eyes narrowed. He’s obviously testing her, but Kaede has little clue what on. “Well,” she says, preparing to choose her words carefully, “now that we’re done with random accusations, I suppose we should go back to my first proposal of everyone just sharing what they found. And to set an example,” she stares straight at Kokichi. “I’ll go first, starting with the room where we found Kirumi’s glove.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His grin doesn’t falter for a second. “The floor is yours, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “For those who don’t know, there’s a room that overlooks the pool. After investigating Kirumi’s body, Tenko, Himiko, Kaito, and myself decided to check it out to get an overhead view of the crime scene from the window.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which I did,” says Kaito. “Not sure if there was much to the view, but Kirumi’s body was, like, right under the window and shit. Oh,” he smacks a fist into his palm, “and there was a knife kind of far from her body, but I guess the killer was pretty fucking careful about not letting it drip blood anywhere since there wasn’t a trail between the two.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well that’s suspicious,” mutters Ryoma. “Why would the killer bother with something like that if they were just going to leave the murder weapon behind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A very good question,” says Korekiyo. “Perhaps it has something to do with the blood in the gym? I only investigated there very briefly, but if my memory serves, I remember no trail of blood or footprints leading back out of the gym. If it’s the same in both areas, the two could be connected?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta furrows his brow. “The killer did the same thing in both places? Does Gonta have that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” answers Korekiyo. “Though I’m afraid it’s only a tentative theory right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I’m still not clear on the specifics, but there might be something to that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Angie. “A mysterious killer who left the pool and the gym without a trace!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They’re probably magic,” says Himiko. “But it’s not me, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course not, Himiko,” says Tenko. “You would never use your magic for such evil deeds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she agrees. “That’d be a lot of work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… not a good reason to not commit murder,” mumbles Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “It seems no one else will point out the obvious contradiction here, so I suppose I’ll have to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her. “What contradiction?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “Have you been paying attention to your own evidence? Think clearly about it, and you’ll understand what’s wrong with the lack of blood at the crime scenes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Remember the state of Kirumi’s body,” says Maki.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko took care of looking closely at her wounds, and Tsumugi can back Tenko up,” says Tenko. “The Monokuma File was correct in identifying her injuries as multiple cuts along her arms and chest, as well as slit throat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The wound to her throat,” says Tsumugi. “Was the killing blow. Ugh, it was so awful. Poor, Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko raises her hand. “There was also her hand, but we already talked about that a lot. The blood under her nails and stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That’s right. Tenko has no doubts that Kirumi tried her very hardest to fight back against whatever terrible boy killed her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “Her killer could be a girl, y’know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doubts it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait a minute,” says Kaede. “Maki’s talking about how we established that Kirumi definitely fought back against her killer. If that’s the case, why were all the puddles of blood so—I don’t know the right words—neat? I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Angie gets it!” she says. “When there were blood sacrifices on Angie’s island, God always told everyone to be extra careful about cleaning it up, so no one would slip if they happened to walk through it without noticing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “And if you’re in the middle of a fight for your life, it’s unlikely you’re going to pay too much attention to keeping puddles of your own blood neat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That makes a lot of sense,” Kaede says, bringing a hand up to her chin in thought. “Also now that I think about it, the pool as the scene for a fight always bothered me. With the no swimming rule, it’s just too risky that someone in a fight like that would fall in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko also did not see anything else at the pool that indicated there was a struggle there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Perhaps the gym then?” asks Korekiyo. “It’s the only other place, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “So would that theory be that Kirumi was killed in the gym and then carried to the pool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s a chance,” says Ryoma. “When I was checking out the gym, I did notice a cut on one of the walls. It wasn’t too big, but it was reasonably close to the blood we found, and it was probably made by a knife or something.” He tilts his head towards Gonta. “Gonta and Angie can back me up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta also saw it,” he agrees. “It looked like someone tried to stab the wall, but… that was the only thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that reminds Angie,” she says. “When Angie was checking out the gym, she thought it’d be a great place for Himiko to put on a magic show!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko blinks up at her. “A magic show? I guess I could… do something like that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says it would be completely amazing,” she cheers. “So that means God also really hopes you’re not the killer, Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko suddenly blanches. “Uh, thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-don’t talk that way to Himiko,” says Tenko. “Especially since there is no doubt that Himiko is not the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no doubt?” asks Kokichi. “None at all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko turns to him. “Tenko believes that there is no chance that Himiko would do something as horrible as murder. She is not that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” he says. “Who here do you think is that kind of person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” she says. “You can’t just ask Tenko a question like that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“C’mon, Tenko,” Kokichi pleads. “Take a guess about who the killer is! I already tried, so now it’s your turn.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” says Kaede. “Whatever you’re doing, knock it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He keeps going. “You think it’s a boy, right? And we’ve beaten the Kiiboy horse to death, so who else do you think it could be? If it’s a boy, then you’ve got at least a one in five shot of getting it right!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko doesn’t know,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to hear your guess, too,” says Maki. “You investigated the body and this mysterious room Kaede keeps alluding to. Surely you have some thoughts of your own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s sweating, and Kaede desperately thinks of a way to get her out of whatever trap she’s being lured into. “Maki, Kokichi,” she says. “Stop ganging up on her. You have no reason to suspect—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do though,” says Maki. “I understand you’ve purposefully been avoiding it, but the fact of the matter is we found a motive video meant for Tenko hidden in Kirumi’s apron.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A silence falls over the students. Maki says, “Do you all understand now? Kaede knew this whole time and has purposefully been hiding evidence. This is exactly like what happened with Shuichi, isn’t it?” Kaede barely resists flinching. “Tenko’s the killer, and Kaede’s protecting her. She’s trying to get us all killed. Again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Tenko is not the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right,” says Tenko. “Tenko never even saw her motive video. Someone is framing her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then who’s video did you get?” Kokichi asks tilting his head. “I watched a lot of the videos during the appreciation party, but the one from your room just happened to be missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s just a coincidence,” says Tenko. “Tenko had her video somewhere safe where no terrible boys could get their hands on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu frowns. “But why’d you do something like that?” She grins. “Was there something dirty on it? Was it your lesbian orgy?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She just fucking said the video she got wasn’t hers,” says Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a sideways look. “And you just trust her word?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” he says slamming his fists together. “And I saw it with my own fucking eyes, so I know what the hell I’m talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko speaks up, “You saw the video Tenko got, too?” She blinks at her own words. “Oops.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo raises his eyebrows. “How curious. Himiko, were you also privy to the video Tenko had?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” she says, glancing to Tenko and then Kaede for guidance. “Maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well then,” says Korekiyo. “The answer to this problem is simple. If Tenko received a different video, all she needs to do is show us. Would that not be adequate evidence?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts nervously, eyes darting to Ryoma and back to Kaede. “Tenko… would prefer not to do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kiibo. “That gave me an idea. If Tenko’s video was found on Kirumi’s body, assuming the video is not Kirumi’s own, does that mean someone here is missing a video player?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta thinks so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that person is most likely to be the killer,” says Ryoma. “Am I following you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Kiibo with a nod of his head. “So if we have everyone simply presents their video players, whoever is missing one is likely the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pales. “Ah, I’m afraid that won’t work since I left mine in my room. Too bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, me, too!” Kaito shouts quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shoots a quick look to Himiko, and with her prompting she says, “I… also forgot mine. It was kind of a pain to carry around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands. “Angie isn’t carrying hers either! God said it would be safe in Angie’s room so she just left it there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But… Kokichi broke into all our rooms earlier,” says Tsumugi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko also does not have her video player on her,” she adds in quickly. “But that does not mean she is suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces at Tenko’s defense of herself. She looks out across the room. Herself, Kaito, Himiko, Angie, and Tenko made five. If she could get even more, then maybe… Kaede looks up at Gonta, and says, “Ah, Gonta, before we got on the elevator, you wanted to ask me about bringing your video because you left it in your room. But we had to hurry, so you don’t have it either, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks at her openmouthed for a moment, and Kaede reaches out to rest a hand on his arm. He looks down at her small hand, clinging to him for protection and he very slowly says, “Th-that’s right. Gonta’s kind of an idiot, and he… just happened to forget.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can feel Ryoma’s eyes boring into her from across the room, but gives everyone else the biggest smile she can when she says. “Well, that’s six people who don’t have one here at the very least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose,” says Kiibo. “That showing the videos wouldn’t accomplish much then… especially since I also don’t have mine, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “Hey, Kiiboy, wasn’t this your dumb robot idea to begin with?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-well, yes!” he protests. “But my inner voice told me it made sense, even if it wouldn’t work directly for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Inner voice?’” echoes Angie. “Ooh, Kiibo, is God talking to you, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… don’t know,” he says frowning. “Maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo being touched by God aside,” says Ryoma darkly. “We’re still not a step closer to clearing Tenko’s name.” He says his words directly to Kaede. “Are we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “But I won’t give up until we do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will not give up fighting either,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says dully, “I’ll also… something for Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Himiko. “Tenko did a lot during the investigation, right? The killer wouldn’t do that… probably.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A smart killer would help,” says Maki. “In fact, they’d position themselves in key locations and drive other people away from important crime scenes to control evidence. Both things Tenko did immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is just a coincidence,” says Tenko. “Tenko may have done things like that, but it was for entirely different reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was there for the body investigation, too,” says Tsumugi. “And the whole thing with the video player was… certainly suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “Then that settles it! Especially since Tenko has no alibi!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shouts, “Wait, that’s wrong! Tenko does have an alibi! She and I were together the whole night, from right after nighttime began to this morning—it couldn’t have been her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were… together the <i>whole night</i>?” Himiko repeats. She pulls her hat down. “Like, together-together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I fucking knew Chabashitra was a lesbian!” shouts Miu, spit flying from her mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-nothing happened between us, Himiko!” Tenko quickly amends. “Kaede and Tenko simply stayed up most of the night planning for the video screening. When we realized what time it was, we decided Tenko might as well sleep in Kaede’s room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tenko, you should be more careful!” Kokichi scolds. “Spending the night alone with Kaede in her room is dangerous!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “How is that possibly dangerous?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Isn’t it obvious?” he says. “You’ve got that killer vibe to you. Personally I’m surprised this isn’t Tenko’s trial!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would never hurt Tenko,” Kaede snaps. “Don’t even joke about that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He tilts his head. “Who said it was a joke?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Ryoma sighs. “The point is that Kaede’s Tenko’s alibi, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “Like I’ve been saying, that doesn’t mean anything though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Huh? What are you talking about? If we were together the whole time—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said that in the last trial with Shuichi,” Maki says. “And you almost got everyone executed. You’ve already proven that you’re willing to kill everyone here to let someone else escape. Who says you’re not doing that with Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her fists in a near desperate attempt to stop herself from biting back, telling Maki she doesn’t know anything. But then Kaede remembers who she’s talking to, and she swallows her pride. She has to clear Tenko’s name before she can get herself killed by insulting the Ultimate Assassin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods, a guilty look on her face. “That is true… sorry Kaede,” she says. “Well, ah, do we have anything else besides Kaede’s word that they were together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have Tenko’s word!” Tenko responds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe,” Korekiyo begins, “that Tsumugi wanted to ask if we have the word of anyone who is not currently being suspected.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede closes her eyes. Tenko’s still sweating, and Kaede clenches her fists when she reminds herself that she is absolutely not going to let this trial end like the last one. She lets out a deep breath and thinks—what proof does she have that she and Tenko were together?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want to believe you,” says Tsumugi. “I really do, but what evidence is there besides Kaede’s word?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we know we can’t trust that,” Maki says. “Not after what happened last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko also said they were together,” replies Himiko. “So I believe she didn’t do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Himiko,” Tenko stutters, hand to her heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, this is a trial though,” Kiibo begins. “And though I do not like doubting my friends, we simply should not take a suspect at their word.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh that was really harsh, Kiiboy!” says Kokichi. “Does that mean you think Tenko is a liar?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-do not put words in my mouth!” Kiibo shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry Kiibs, I gottcha,” Miu says. “You’re saying we can’t fucking trust them because nobody saw them leaving to go scissor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly!” Kiibo responds. He frowns. “But I do not believe a pair of scissors was involved.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes flick open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu, that’s wrong,” she says. “Before Tenko came to my room, we were at training with Kaito and Korekiyo saw us return to the dorms. They can confirm that we were together for almost the whole night, and that we went to my room together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” says Kaito. “That’s right. I even remember walking you guys to Kaede’s door now that I think about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just like a dumb boy to not say that until now,” Tenko huffs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, I’m proving you innocent!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tenko responds. “And you should have done so earlier!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The point is,” Kaede interrupts. “Kaito and Korekiyo both saw us.” She sighs, fiddling with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “Do you guys believe me now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo waves a finger. “I’m afraid it’s still too early to clear Tenko of suspicion if that’s what you are saying.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just said I saw them,” Kaito says. “And you saw them, too. How does not prove they were together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Angie thinks she gets is,” she says. “Korekiyo, you mean, like, Tenko and Kaede could have left the room after you and Kaito went to bed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So even if though I did see them go to Kaede’s room it doesn’t mean they stayed there, yes,” Korekiyo concludes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah-ha! Angie did get it!” she cheers. “That means Tenko did do it! Yay!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s not true!” Tenko shouts at roughly the same time Himiko says, distressed “Angie—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels herself slowly begin to panic. Tenko didn’t do it. She knows Tenko didn’t do it. There has to be something. There has to be <i>something.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, and he sounds so close and so distant when he says, “Real shame there’s nothing we have to pinpoint what time the murder took place.” And Kaede swears he’s speaking only to her when he says, “That’d be a real help, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches for Shuichi’s hat, mind racing through all their evidence when she suddenly remembers, “Wait, everyone,” she says. “I think… I think I know the evidence that proves the murder happened while Tenko and I were together at training.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki seems unconcerned. “And that would be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The places where we found evidence. One of them was the gym,” she says. “And since it’s against the rules to go into the gym—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever happened there had to happen before nighttime, at which point we were already all together,” says Kaito, smacking himself in the forehead. “I remember now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko lets out a sigh of relief, but says, “It would have been nice if you remembered that earlier…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-hey, Kaede also remembered it just now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Himiko carefully. “Does that mean Tenko’s not suspicious anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki lets out a sigh. “I suppose so. And,” she absently plays with her hair, seemingly debating her next words. “I also have a bit of evidence that the murder took place in early in the night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “You do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yes, but I think I’ll keep it to myself a while longer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Now that’s suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can doubt me if you want,” she says. “It won’t accomplish much, but I can’t stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sooo,” says Kokichi. “Now that we’re down yet another suspect, I think it’s time Kaede finally fesses up to where her secret room full of evidence is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “The room where we looked down at the pool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” he answers. “You keep talking about it, but you’ve yet to say where it actually is, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… true,” she says. “I didn’t think it mattered too much, but,” she looks to Kaito for reassurance and then quickly to Ryoma. “It’s in the back of Ryoma’s research lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu slams both hands on her podium. “Hey! Why does the blowjob midget get a second room to his research lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a dark look. “You want to rethink that nickname?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cowers. “I-it was j-just a little j-joke, c’mon…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh wait,” says Angie, puffing out her cheek. “Even God didn’t tell Angie about a secret room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shrugs. “Not a lot of people knew—Kaito and I discovered it while we were exploring the school, and,” she frowns. “It’s not a very nice place, so we just never really brought it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Angie continues. “God says there was totally a lot of evidence in there, right? Wouldn’t that mean that the killer totally knew about it before hand?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods at her. “That is a very interesting observation, Angie. And, if I may continue it,” he says. “Wouldn’t that now paint out dear Ryoma in a rather suspicious light?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares. “I never set foot in there. Just because it was my research lab doesn’t mean I have anything to do with what happens in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” says Himiko, pressing a finger to her chin. “But not many people knew about it, right? And while we were looking around, Kaede said the killer probably was betting on people not checking there… so it had to be someone who knew about it before hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “Still doesn’t mean it was me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you are the most suspicious now,” says Kokichi. “Aren’t you, Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already told you,” Ryoma says. “I don’t do stuff like that anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, c’mon, Ryoma,” Kokichi persists. “Can’t you think of a better defense than that? Especially since you were the one pushing to see your motive video the hardest?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks at him and takes in a deep breath. Then he pulls his hat down, and Kaede has never seen him look so exhausted. “I don’t know what you want me to say,” he says finally. “I know I don’t have an alibi, but I still never set foot in there, but,” he shakes his head. “Whatever, it doesn’t matter. I’m… tired of fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at him with wide eyes as he suddenly seems as so much smaller than normal, “Ryoma—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then Gonta will fight for you!” shouts Gonta suddenly next to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks up at him. “Gonta?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Ryoma cannot fight for himself,” he says. “Then Gonta will do his very best to fight for him! Because Gonta believes in Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks genuinely bewildered. “You… do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta knows Ryoma has had a hard past, but he also knows that Ryoma would never harm one of his friends! Gonta isn’t,” he seems to falter slightly. “Very smart… and he doesn’t know what was in the hidden room, but he does know that Ryoma is his friend! And Gonta is going to protect his friend, no matter what.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma is stunned into absolute silence, looking with wide eyes at Gonta.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between them and makes a decision to make a leap of faith. “I believe in you, too, Ryoma,” she says, pumping her fists. “And I’m going to fight for you, too.” She looks to Gonta. “Gonta and I promised we’d protect out friends, and that’s exactly what we’re going to do.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Man, this was a dialog heavy chapter.

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steadies herself in the face of her own blind belief. Even without looking directly at him, Kaede can sense the deep fire-y conviction burning in Gonta’s eyes as he launches into the first defense that comes to him. “It is impossible,” he says. “For Ryoma to be the killer. And Gonta has many reasons, but the most important is that Ryoma is not the kind of person who would ever hurt his friends!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her pulse is racing, in fear, in exhilaration, in the strange fact that she was finally living up to her own words about trust.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s eyes twinkle. “But Ryoma’s killed before, right? Are you saying he was lying about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta falters. “N-no. Gonta knows that, and Gonta,” he finds himself again, “Gonta also knows that Ryoma had a good reason for doing what he did. Killing Kirumi is a completely different situation and something he would never do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“His reasons don’t matter,” Kokichi’s voice drops in volume. “A killer’s a killer. And in this killing game,” his smile turns cruel, “good reasons and bad reasons don’t mean anything. Both result in the deaths of everyone here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Gonta knows that, too, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what?” and the darkness around Kokichi turns out like a light switch. “C’mon, I know you guys aren’t very smart, but you have to have been paying attention to that rule. Man, you guys are all so bad at this game!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finally finds her voice. “None of this is a game to us,” she says. “And Ryoma knows exactly what would happen to everyone here, and he’s not the kind of person who would ever risk something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gives her a long, searching look, seemingly stunned into silence, just long enough for Gonta to get another word in. “That’s right. Ryoma would never hurt people he knew did nothing wrong, and he would never hurt us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But Kaede can tell Kokichi isn’t listening to a word Gonta said, still staring straight at her. Kaede feels herself begin to sweat under his gaze and the weight of the secret lingering between the two of them, when Kokichi, eyes still locked on her says, “How about it, Ryoma? You’re the one on trial after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “I… don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma…?” Gonta looks heartbroken.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sorry,” he mumbles pulling his hat down. “I don’t know. He’s right. A killer’s a killer. That’s just part of who I am now, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the hell are you saying!?” shouts Kaito. “What the hell is your goddamn problem?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just blinks at him. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “Gonta’s arguing his fucking heart out for you, and that’s all you have to say?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s eyes widen. “Kaito, it’s alright, Gonta just wants to help, and if Ryoma isn’t convinced, then Gonta just needs to try harder. So please don’t get mad at Ryoma, for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” he yells. “I’m fucking angry about this!” He points a finger at Ryoma. “You! You’re not the goddamn culprit. I know you’re not, Kaede knows you’re not, and fucking Gonta knows you’re not, so get off your ass and say something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “I already said I don’t know what you want me to say. I didn’t kill Kirumi. Happy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out an aggravated groan. “You don’t get it, do you? Fucking Kokichi pointed out the rules, and you still don’t get it. You’re not the killer, but if you don’t say a word to defend yourself, the real one’s going to get away, and everyone here will die.” He jerks his head towards Gonta. “Maybe you don’t care about your life, but all the people who believe in you will die, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma opens his mouth, before clenching his jaw.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That won’t happen,” says Gonta. “Because Gonta already said he will fight for Ryoma, and he won’t give up until his innocence is proven. So there’s no need to worry about that, and,” he turns to Kaito, “and everyone should stop being mad at Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between the two of them. “Hey, Ryoma,” she says, soft voice strong amidst the yelling. “You said you wanted a reason to live or to keep fighting alongside us, right? Maybe even someone who believed in you?” She jerks her head towards Gonta. “Think you found it yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares with wide eyes. Gonta just seems confused. “What did Ryoma find?” he asks almost too earnestly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede holds her breath, then Ryoma lowers his hat with just the slightest smile on his face. “I’ll tell you later, big guy,” he says. “The point Kaede’s making though is that I’m an idiot. But,” he turns to the rest of the group with a newfound determination. “I’m an idiot who had nothing to do with Kirumi’s murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well that’s nice,” Kokichi says, looking to his fingernails. “You still don’t really have any proof, but it’s super nice, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I hate to agree,” says Kiibo hesitantly. “But Kokichi’s right in that we still need evidence to prove Ryoma’s innocence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” says Kaede. “And I also think I know what will prove it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta believes Ryoma is innocent!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But there was vital evidence in Ryoma’s lab,” adds Korekiyo. “Was there not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko taps her chin. “Not very many people knew about his lab in the first place… and Ryoma was one of them…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And any of those people could be the killer,” says Ryoma. “Doesn’t mean it was me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess so,” says Himiko dully. “But why would the killer go there in the first place anyway? Did they really like tennis?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have a feeling you are getting a bit off topic, Himiko,” scolds Korekiyo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “Do not speak down to Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” says Kaito. “I get that you like her, but <i>c’mon.</i> Even you can’t believe liking tennis has anything to do with the murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko raises her hand. “And maybe they went to the pool afterwards because they really like swimming.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Himiko, please…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaede. “We’re getting a bit off topic, but if you think about the evidence we found in the hidden room in Ryoma’s lab, there’s a really clear difference between Ryoma and the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just looks at her. “Okay, I know I was there, but I’m fucking drawing a blank.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hums. “I think I have an idea… but you should say what you think first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suppresses her sigh. “Alright,” she says. “One of the key things we found in Ryoma’s talent lab was that the net was taken down. And it was taken down in a way that someone who knew a lot about tennis wouldn’t do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yeah,” says Kaito. “One of the cords was completely hacked through, right? I remember when we were looking at it, it seemed like whoever took it down was having a real fucking hard time and then figured out what the hell they were doing halfway through or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede nods. “And someone as knowledgeable and experienced with tennis as Ryoma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wouldn’t do something like that!” finishes Gonta. “Which means Ryoma is innocent!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” says Kaede. “And a killer cleaning up a crime scene probably wouldn’t waste time like that if they knew what they were doing in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma bears something resembling a smile. “I’d say that’s true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Himiko. “I was gonna say Ryoma’s too short to reach Kirumi’s neck…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko believes that is also true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “That’s probably also true, I guess…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, oh!” Kokichi chirps. “And Ryoma’s super strong and fast, so if he wanted to kill someone like Kirumi, there probably wouldn’t have even been a struggle, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just sighs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him. “Kokichi? Why are you helping?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because Ryoma’s obviously not the killer,” he says. “Man, you’re soooo slow, Kaede. We’ll never find the real killer at this rate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re the one who’s been accusing him this whole time!” Kaede says, jabbing a finger over Himiko’s head.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he rolls his eyes. “‘Cause I wanted to see how the real killer would react, and you totally went and ruined it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands together. “Oh, hey guys! Angie just thought of something! Kokichi’s been leading the conversation a lot, so what if he’s the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not,” says Kokichi blankly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, guess he’s not!” she amends. “God’s taking a nap right now, so Angie’s just guessing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns at her. “The hell are you believing him so easily for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “God, I hope Kokichi’s the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kokichi sniffles. “My beloved Kaito’s being so mean to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” he shouts. “And I told you to quit fucking calling me that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie has a really good feeling about Kokichi,” she says. “God says he’s trustworthy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “I thought you said God was taking a nap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie’s God seems to sleep and wake when it pleases him,” replies Korekiyo. “However he stills seems to have a shockingly high accuracy rate for various predictions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Angie will ask the next question, okay?” she says. “So, so, so, Angie wants to know more about the secret room. Like why was the net taken down?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “That’s a good question. Part of it was also wet, which means the killer either washed it in the sink in Ryoma’s research lab, or part of it went into the pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises her eyebrows. “There was a sink?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaede. “Does that matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns away. “The killer probably could have washed away blood easily then, if they had access to it, and…” she brings her hand to her chin. “… That likely explains that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yo, Harukmaki,” says Kaito. “You think of something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares at him. “Don’t call me that. And I simply figured something out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Feel like sharing?” he prompts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki frowns. “It’s nothing earth shattering. However,” she turns back to Kaede. “The presence of a sink is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “A sink is earth shattering!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, wait,” says Tsumugi. “If there was sink, I have a question. If the killer had access to something that could clean up blood… why would they leave a bloody knife?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Well, the killer’s obviously a fucking idiot, right? Everyone knows you throw out all the bloody shit after—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” interrupts Kaede. “I really do not want to know where you’re going with that, so let’s just focus on Tsumugi’s question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-it—I wasn’t gonna make a sex joke!” she protests. “It was a peri—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree with Kaede,” Kokichi smiles. “The pig should shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“St-stop calling me a fucking pig!” she shouts, before suddenly doing an about face in demeanor. “U-unless, you, y’know—I could be kind of it tha—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” says Kaede clapping her hands together. “That is enough of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Seriously. Hey, Tsumugi, what was your question, again? I kinda forgot…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “I… don’t really want to ask it again now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ahh, boo,” says Kokichi. “Looks like Miu went and ruined everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe Tsumugi’s question,” says Korekiyo. “Was about the presence of a murder weapon when the killer had the ability to dispose of evidence. Is that correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “That sounds about right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then let me continue,” he says. “I, personally, have two theories—either the killer did not have as much access to the sink as we are assuming or the murder weapon itself is simply unimportant.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” says Tenko. “Do not forget that the knife was down at the pool and the sink was up in Ryoma’s research lab. Carrying a bloody weapon all the way around the school would likely be something not even the least competent killer would do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Kiibo. “In that theory, the killer simply left the knife because it was too risky to even chance disposing of, but,” he frowns. “Why was some evidence seemingly removed then? Like whatever happened to the tennis net?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, thinking hard. “I’d argue the tennis net wasn’t disposed of at all. I mean, anyone who walked into Ryoma’s lab would have realized it was missing and could have found it in the next room. The killer probably just wasn’t that concerned with cleaning it up since so few people would have thought to go there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, Kaede,” says Korekiyo. “Didn’t you say the net was wet? Would that not indicate the culprit attempted to clean it?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” says Gonta. “Gonta still isn’t sure why the net is important… Kaede said the culprit spent time taking it down so it has to be… but what was it used for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s also a good question,” says Kaede. “But… between the net and the hidden room, and the state of the crime scene at the pool,” she straightens Shuichi’s hat. “I’m beginning to piece together a theory about how the crime took place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Only some of the evidence at the crime scene,” says Korekiyo, “was properly disposed of. The killer likely assumed the rest was inconsequential.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dunno about that,” says Kaito. “A murder weapon seems pretty fucking consequential to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The killer probably wanted to get rid of it,” says Tenko. “But they did not have access to the sink.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hums. “The sink in the hidden room and the crime scene are pretty far away from each other. You’d have to run all the way around the school to get rid of evidence… and that’s a lot of running…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it would also involve moving evidence covered in blood,” says Korekiyo. “It would be rather unfortunate for the killer if someone happened to stumble upon them when they were doing such things, if they did in fact use the sink in Ryoma’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scratches the back of his head. “Right… Is there really not a more convenient place to get rid of evidence?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko points at him. “The killer probably used magic to transport stuff up through the window!” She frowns. “But it’s still not me, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone,” says Kaede. “I think… I know the answer to this problem. What if… the murder didn’t take place in the pool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe we discussed this earlier,” says Korekiyo. “Does that mean you think it happened in the gym?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie jumps up. “We did say those were the most likely places right? So which is it?” She leans to one side. “The pool?” She leans towards the other. “Or the gym?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Neither,” says Kaede. “What makes the most sense… is that the fight and the murder took place in the hidden room in the back of Ryoma’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” says Kiibo. “That would account for the lack of signs of struggle we found in the pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma fiddles absently with his cigarette, eyes narrowed in thought. “There was one sign of a fight in the gym and the blood, but not much else,” he pockets his cigarette. “Also with nighttime approaching, you probably wouldn’t have a lot of time to fight or clean up evidence before getting kicked out.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the hidden room,” Tenko says. “Tenko does not recall seeing much damage to the room, however the killer had the ability to easily clean up blood there, and the room is generally made of stone and tile, which are harder to leave identifiable scratch marks against than the wooden walls of the gym.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” says Kaede. “Remember that the killer would have to return to their room for the night, which would involve walking around the school. They’d probably want to clean themselves up a bit first before doing that, just in case they did happen to run into someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” says Himiko. “And I also remember that when we checked the towels and stuff in the pool, none of them looked used… so if they did clean the blood off of them, they probably didn’t do it there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta brings a hand to his chin. “That all makes sense… but when did the killer and Kirumi go to the pool then? That’s where Kirumi’s body was, so… they had to have gone there at some point, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “That point does present a bit of problem, however. We have three locations where the crime took place, and if Kaede’s reasoning is correct, that would mean the scene of the fight and the place the killer used to dispose of evidence is a different place than where we found the body, which is a bit odd, is it not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right,” says Tsumugi. “Would that mean the killer moved the body all the way from Ryoma’s lab down to the pool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “It can’t be that simple. If moving a bloody weapon around would attract too much attention, moving a body is simply is out of the question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kirumi had to be killed at the pool then,” says Korekiyo. “Is that correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo crosses his arms, looking dissatisfied. “It’s… the only thing I can think of right now, but something about that is bothering me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me, too,” Kaito agrees. “‘Cause if shit did happen at the pool, and they couldn’t walk around the school after the murder, then what? Did the killer fucking climb up the wall to get to Ryoma’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “It’s the opposite. I still think the murder took place in Ryoma’s talent lab, and I do think they moved Kirumi’s body from there down to the pool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is still not sure how the killer would do that without being noticed,” says Tenko. “But, if Kaede is right and the killer purposefully moved Kirumi’s body to the pool, would that mean everything we discovered at the crime scene was purposefully planted there by the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa-whoa, wait,” says Kaito. “<i>Everything</i> was fucking planted? Does that mean we can’t trust anything there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “I don’t think Kaede’s wrong, but that’s a pretty big leap in logic.” Her cold eyes turn on Kaede. “If you want us to believe your theory, then answer this: how did the killer move the body?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And God says they definitely didn’t just carry it!” says Angie.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs on the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “I think… the most logical explanation is that they used the window connecting the two rooms, right?” she gives her classmates a once over. “It’s the simplest solution.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you know what they say about the simplest solution!” says Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, what?” asks Himiko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s usually right!” adds Tsumugi. “Oh, unless you’re playing a puzzle game—then it’s usually a red herring, and the culprit is the person you’d least expect, but then you start getting savvy to that and begin to suspect the people who are the least suspicious, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the window’s suspicious,” says Ryoma. “It makes sense that if the killer was up in my talent lab that they could just throw stuff down. The question is why though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Wait. That doesn’t sound right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glances over to her. “Something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yes. Tenko investigated Kirumi’s body, and she had no wounds that indicated she had fallen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did not investigate the body,” adds Korekiyo. “But I recall the Monokuma File not indicating anything about injuries one would get from being thrown out a window.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wouldn’t that also leave a much bigger blood splat?” asks Angie. “Ooh, ooh, and God just reminded Angie that Maki said Kirumi had a motive video on her! If she fell, wouldn’t the motive video have been damaged?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that is against the rules,” says Korekiyo. “Very good observation, Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smiles. “It was all God’s doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. How did the killer move the body? <i>Why</i> did the killer move the body?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Kokichi. “What do you say, Kaede? Have you connected your own dots yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My own… ‘dots?’” Kaede parrots.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He grins. “You’ve already said it. Can’t you find the answers you’ve already given yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito asks, “The hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shushes him. “Not now. I’m trying to have a conversation with Kaede. I mean, I would normally rather talk to my beloved Kaito any day of the week, buuuut I have the feeling she’s on the edge of something important.” He smiles. “You understand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you,” he huffs. “To knock it off with that shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kaito,” says Kaede, mind racing. “Can you be quiet for a second? I’m trying to think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wha—you, too?” he shouts. “Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” says Tenko. “Kaede asked you to be quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “This is absolute bullshit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Wow, Kaito, looks like you got rejected, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, I’ve really fucking had it up to here with you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Tenko scolds. “Quiet!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Argh!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They bicker. Kaede thinks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quit telling me,” says Kaito. “To shut up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are not being helpful to the conversation,” says Tenko. “Unless you have a useful theory on how Kirumi’s body was moved, please refrain from speaking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay, fine,” Kaito says. “But what about him?” he jabs a finger towards Kokichi. “He hasn’t said anything useful!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi presses a finger to his lip. “But I have. I never got a look at Ryoma’s lab, but Kaede apparently got to see everything. And there’s something she mentioned that could definitely explain a thing or two.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “There was something in there… that was used to move Kirumi’s body? Well now that I think about it,” he rubs the back of his head. “Her body was like right under the fucking window, so they didn’t move it very far… just kinda dropped it, maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now that is a useful thing to say,” says Tenko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup!” Kokichi cheers. “Looks like Kaito is useful for something, after all.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s about to launch into another fight, when Kaede quickly cuts him off. “That’s right!” she says. “Kirumi’s body wasn’t thrown, it was carefully placed. And the killer did it without leaving the hidden room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta is confused,” he says. “How could the culprit place a body without going down to the pool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did they use magic?” Himiko asks. “‘Cause that sounds like something you would need magic for…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “The killer moved the body using the tennis net. That’s why it was taken down, and that’s why it was wet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu gasps. “The net? How the fuck would a net move a body?” She tosses her hair over her shoulder. “I mean, the great Miu Iruma could probably invent a net that could automatically move weights like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re not the culprit,” says Kokichi. “So it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-hey, you can’t just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Here’s what happened,” says Kaede. “The murder took place in Ryoma’s research lab where the killer could easily dispose of whatever evidence they needed, but to hide the scene of the crime, they took down the net and used it to lower the body through the window and down to the pool. Also,” she straightens her hat, confidence surging through her anew. “You’d have to be pretty strong to do it, but if you placed the body in the middle of the net and carefully fed more through the window to slowly lower it, you could move a body without damaging or disturbing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito smacks a fist into his palm. “And when you have it placed on the ground where you want, if you just let one end go to pick the net back up, it’d probably fall into the pool or something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “And then at least half of it would get wet, more if the killer washed the blood off after bringing it back into the room to hide it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” says Kiibo. “And if that is the case, would that mean both Kirumi and the killer never went to the pool in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what I’m beginning to suspect,” says Kaede. “And that would also mean that the knife we found was likely thrown from the window or moved in a similar way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko drawls, “Does that mean I was right when I found the knife? It was just planted by the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh,” says Angie, waving a hand in the air. “Does that also mean the knife wasn’t the murder weapon then? Since the killer wanted us to find it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure about that,” she says. “From the injuries Tenko found, it is still likely the murder weapon was something sharp, and a kitchen knife is still very plausible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But whether or not they actually used it, the killer still wanted us to find the knife,” says Ryoma. “If they never went to the pool, they could have just hidden it or returned it to the kitchen or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki speaks up. “Is it not obvious? The killer clearly wanted us to picture the murder a certain way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma turns to her. “And what way is that? Feel like sharing yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a long look, then in the same quiet, emotionless voice, “Another question has the answer to that.” She turns to Kaede. “Kaede, you seem to have all the answers. Can you tell me what Kirumi was doing the night of her death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Besides fucking being killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns her glare on her. “I wasn’t talking to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrinks back into herself. “I-I w-was just tr-tryin’ to help…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘What Kirumi was doing the night of her death…’” Kaede echoes before frowning. “Maki, what do you know about Kirumi’s death that you’re hiding from us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns away. “I’m not hiding anything. I simply don’t think it’s wise to immediately share important information in front of the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Miu barks, regaining her confidence. “Anyone else think it’s weird Maki just happens to know a bunch of shit we don’t?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito crosses his arms. “Well, she stays up real late, right? Maybe she just fucking happened to see something when she left her lab for the night.” He shrugs. “Don’t think there’s anything weird about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well it’s weird that she’s being a total bitch about it,” Miu scoffs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already explained my reasons,” Maki answers. “It’s your own fault if you don’t listen to them.” She shakes her head. “Suspecting me will accomplish nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth turns into a tight thin line. “Hey, Korekiyo,” she says. “Did you see Maki return to the dorms last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “I did not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Well do you usually see her return at night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Korekiyo answers. “But I usually retire to bed roughly around midnight when your training sessions end. Maki likely returns to her room after then, I can only assume.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, Maki as wandering the school alone at night when Kirumi was killed?” Kokichi asks. “Man, that’s a pretty amazing coincidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at him. “Is it a coincidence if it happens literally every night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but, but,” says Angie. “If Korekiyo was watching the dorms, doesn’t that mean that the killer has to be someone who was already out at night? God was also watching the dorms and he says that Korekiyo totally would have noticed if someone tried to leave!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I also say I would have noticed if someone left,” he responds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The lines on Kiibo’s face change his expression to one of deep concentration. “Korekiyo, what times were you watching the dorms from?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “From just after the start of nighttime to midnight! He already said that, Kiiboy! Is there something wrong with your memory card or your circuits or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-Nothing is wrong with my circuitry!” he says. “I just… never mind,” he sighs. “You’re just going to discriminate against me, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I promise I won’t,” Kokichi says. “Have I ever discriminated against a crummy robot like you before? That doesn’t sound like something I would do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what you do all the time!” Kiibo shouts, pointing an accusing finger at him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to sniffle. “Now Kiiboy’s yelling at me… Kaito, do something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just shakes his head. “I’m just not even gonna fucking acknowledge that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko huffs. “Tenko feels like we have been dragged off topic once again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” asks Kokichi, tears vanishing. “Have we? It’s probably Kiiboy’s fault.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma decides to put an end to his nonsense. “Anyway, Maki asked a question, didn’t she? Though she’s being cryptic for no reason, figuring out what Kirumi was doing before her death is probably important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta agrees. Kiibo said he spoke to her before nighttime last night. Did anyone else see her after that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A moment of silence passes, before Kiibo answers. “It seems like I was the last person to see her then, other than her killer.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When she sabotaged you, right?” asks Angie, bouncing up and down on her heels.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “That… is correct.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But why the fuck did she do something like that?” Miu asks. “Cleaning that crap out was a huge pain in my ass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a good question,” Kaede mumbles quietly before speaking up. “Hey, Kiibo, were you able to investigate Kirumi’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was,” he says. “However,” he falters, “I… discovered that the supplies we had been using to clean the hall were simply left in a corner rather than being properly put away like Kirumi had said she would do. And,” he grimaces, “she also had said she was going to spend time reorganizing things, but I did not find any evidence of that either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s eyes widen. “Does that mean… Kirumi lied?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait,” says Miu. “So fucking Kirumi lied to Kiibs and then crammed him full of dead bugs to make him malfunction?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki speaks to Kaede only. “Do those sound like the actions of an innocent victim?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “Are you saying that Kirumi attacked Kiibo?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kirumi,” says Gonta. “She was always taking care of us… would she really do something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Angie says. “What would attacking Kiibo even accomplish? Like why would she do that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m still not sure exactly what she was trying to do,” says Kaede. “But I think I might know why Kirumi would possibly try something… drastic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo begins, “I don’t want to think Kirumi would try to hurt us, but all the evidence so far seems to be pointing that way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But why would she do something like that?” Gonta asks. “Kirumi was our friend…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Guess she had more going on than we thought… or maybe she wasn’t the person we thought she was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What? Think she was trying to commit murder or something?” Miu asks. “She did a pretty shit job.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Kokichi hums. “Takes one to know one, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-are you talking to me or the gremlin?” Miu stutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares. “Wanna repeat that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squeaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” says Kaede. “That Ryoma’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks to her gravely. “I was afraid of that. Was there more evidence in my lab or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “There was. Remember when I mentioned we found Kirumi’s glove under something the killer would probably want to get rid of if they knew it was there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” says Himiko. “When I was looking in the showers, I didn’t really think there would be anything there, but we found Kirumi’s motive video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “A motive video!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Tenko. “Due to its position at the scene of the crime, and working with our current assumption that Kirumi was the one who placed it there, all signs point to Kirumi having watched her video at some point prior to her death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” says Miu. “It’d fucking have to be prior to her death. Can’t fucking watch something if you’re dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is simply a figure of speech,” says Tenko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Unless Kirumi came back as a gho—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“S-so moving on,” says Kaito quickly. “Uh, so Kirumi’s video was fucking wild, uh,” he glances around, “Tell ‘em, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him. “Why do I have to…” she shakes her head. “Anyway, Kirumi’s video said that she, well,” Kaede looks around at the assembled students. “Kirumi’s person in the outside world is the entire country. She’s… basically the prime minister.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The courtroom explodes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Spit flies from Miu’s mouth. “What!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well that’s…” Ryoma blinks. “Unexpected.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s jumping up and down. “Oh, wow! Oh, wow! Not even God knew about that!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s wringing her hands. “The prime minister was here the whole time and none of us knew?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is a bit hard to believe,” says Korekiyo. “Did Kirumi ever share this information with anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko never heard anything about it before watching the video,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi also didn’t tell me anything,” says Kiibo. “Kirumi was always very impressive, but to think that she was someone so important…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko raises her hand. “It basically said she was the maid of the entire country, so she was just really, really good at her job or something, I guess…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-but,” Gonta stutters. “If that’s true, then why would someone kill Kirumi?!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She didn’t just have one or two people waiting for her… she had everyone…” Ryoma shakes his head. “Damnit… for someone like her to die…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This may simply be an assumption,” Korekiyo says. “But can we presume that the killer never saw her video? It is hard to believe someone would attack Kirumi after learning she was such an important, admirable person.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is unsure of that,” she says. “Because if that was the case, would that not mean that Kirumi received her own video?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “The morning we received out motive videos… I remember running into Kirumi.” She looks up. “Kiibo, you were there, too, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “I was. I believe Kirumi said she received a video that was not meant for her, however,” he frowns, “that could have been a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” says Korekiyo. “You also received your own video, correct? If that is the case, then perhaps everyone simply had their videos traded with someone else with the exception of Kirumi and Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Not necessarily. The videos weren’t a one-to-one trade for everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Gonta. “Ryoma and Gonta talked about the videos with Kaede, and we realized that even though he had Gonta’s, Gonta didn’t have his.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito raises an eyebrow. “You guys tried to trade videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Key word being tried. It didn’t happen. Still don’t know who has mine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Tsumugi. “Even if the videos weren’t a one-to-one trade, can we still assume Kirumi got her own video or does that mean the culprit did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo waves a finger. “I am still hesitant to think her killer saw the video. After all, even is someone was willing to commit murder, there is a difference between simply killing one of their peers and assassinating the prime minister.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at his words and turns to stare at Maki who appears unmoved as ever. “Right,” she says, words hollow. “It’s… pretty hard to believe someone would purposefully assassinate the prime minister.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito follows her gaze, an unreadable expression on his face. “So,” he says slowly. “For now we’re gonna assume Kirumi just got her own video, and the culprit got Tenko’s, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but that’s boring!” says Kokichi. “Wouldn’t it be way more exciting if the culprit got Kirumi’s video, and she convinced them to trade, and then when the culprit’s back was turned, Kirumi attacked them? And then after she killed them—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do not talk that way about Kirumi!” says Tenko. “Also that plainly did not happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but wouldn’t it be exciting if it did?” asks Kokichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clears his throat. “So I kinda hate to admit this, but doesn’t he have a point?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi beams. “I do? Ooh, ooh! What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “All I’m fucking saying is that since her video was hidden when we found it, we’re assumin’ she saw it, and, well,” he shrugs. “Somethin’ like that probably motivated her to try something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps Maki in the corner of her eye even when she says, “So that likely means that on the night of the murder… Kirumi was…” She blinks. “Trying to commit a murder of her own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before the room can explode with sound, Maki’s cold voice rings out, “Now do you understand why the crime scene was setup the way it was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her wary eyes on her. She keeps her voice steady, saying, “Kirumi tried to kill someone, but the killer wanted to hide that fact. But Maki,” Kaede’s voice turns harsh, “how did you know that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “That’s not the question you should be asking. What we need to think about is why—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “I asked you a question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I don’t have to answer,” Maki says plainly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you do,” says Kaede. “I figured out what Kirumi was doing that because I saw her motive video, and the only other people who saw it were Kaito, Tenko, Himiko, and possibly the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki regards her coolly. “Are you implying I’m the killer then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede responds. “Tell the truth. You knew what Kirumi’s intentions were. How?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kaede—” Kaito begins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ve been helping you all this time,” Maki says. “Do you really believe I would do that if I was the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe,” says Kaede. “That you’re refusing to answer my question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clears his throat. “Kaede, she has been helpin’ out, and we don’t have any real reasons to doubt he—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We do though,” says Kaede. “Maki was out late the night of the murder, her lab where she’s been hiding is on the same floor as Ryoma’s lab so she easily could have investigated it and planned to do something there, she knew Kirumi tried to kill someone, she pushed really hard to convince everyone that Tenko was the culprit, and when I checked my backpa—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” Tenko cuts her off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips around to face her. “Wha—oh,” she says, the realization of what she was about to say catching up to her all at once. “Right.” She shakes her head. “My point is, unless you have something to prove your innocence, you’re the most likely suspect right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares. “I’m not the killer. If you vote for me, you’re just killing yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just shakes her head. “That’s not a defense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito tries to interject, “Guys, calm dow—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Maki. “But it’s true.” She sighs. “I knew this would be a pain.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you shouldn’t have killed Kirumi,” says Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Sto—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t,” says Maki.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then prove it!” Kaede shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito shouts, voice rising over Kaede’s. “Both of you shut up and calm the hell down! Yeah, Maki’s suspicious, but we can’t just fucking assume she’s the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her glare on him. “Why are you defending her?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki also silently turns her gaze towards him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause I know she didn’t do it,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “Do you have proof?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he scratches the back of his head. “Not exactly. But I still don’t think she did it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “Kaito, look, I know you want to be there for people, but this is different. Right now Maki is the most suspicious. Just believing in her won’t change that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw and turns to Maki. “Maki,” he says. “You’re not the killer, right? And you’re definitely not just about to fucking give up either, yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a long stare. “Why are you trying to help me? Aren’t you friends with Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says before slamming his fists together. “And I’m trying to be your friend, too. So c’mon—get your act together, and don’t let her beat you!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not letting anyone—” Maki snaps before shaking her head. “Just stop talking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you start arguing for yourself if I do?” Kaito asks, a grin growing over his face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She crosses her arms. “If it will shut you up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right then,” he smiles. “Okay, Kaede, give her your best shot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just glares.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede says. “Is plainly the most suspicious person here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have no reason to doubt me,” says Maki. “You’re only suspecting me because of your own prejudice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You assassi—killed Kirumi!” Kaede shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” she asks. “Because I was out at night? So were you. So were a lot of people here. So was anyone who managed to slip by Korekiyo or simply lied about going back to the dorms before nighttime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “That’s all just speculation. The facts are plainly that you were close to the crime scene, you were alone during the murder, and you’re clearly hiding information. In fact, you’re hiding information right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Only because sharing it would bring unnecessary suspicion upon myself,” Maki says sighing. “Of course, it would appear that has happened anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then just tell us whatever you’ve been hiding!” says Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “You won’t believe me even if I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede points an accusatory finger. “Because you’ve given me no reason to believe in you! All you’ve done is threaten me and my friends since the day we got here! Of course I don’t trust you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki, Kaede,” says Kaito. “Both of you just calm the hell down and listen to each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the same time, they both turn to him. Maki says, “You shut up,” and the same time Kaede says, “Kaito, be quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He throws his hands in the air. “I will when you actually fucking do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Fine. For the time being,” she takes another breath, and prepares to swallow her pride. “I won’t suspect you. Just share what you have to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises her eyebrows. “Is that a promise you can keep?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “I don’t know, so my plan is just to keep my mouth shut until you’re done talking.” She glances around the room. “Kaito can handle the questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me?” he asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaede. “For the sake of moving things forward, I’m going to sit this one out. So,” she gives him a wry smile, “Tell them, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “I knew that was gonna come back to bite me. Alright,” he sighs, “Harumaki, what do you got?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you not to call me that,” Maki frowns. “But I have is… I am almost certain there was a second murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “A second murder weapon?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why the fuck wouldn’t you say that earlier?” Miu shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” barks Kaito. “Let her talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence falls back over the room, and after a moment, Maki continues. “I’ve just been staying in my lab for the past few days, but Kaito keeps insisting on bringing me meals. Last night after he left, I decided to finally do something about the plates that had been starting to pile up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi mumbles, “Wouldn’t you starve if he didn’t bring you meals?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki ignores her. “It was about fifteen or so minutes before nighttime. I took most of the plates down to the kitchen, and,” she glances at Kaede, “I saw Kirumi leaving the cafeteria. I don’t think she saw me, so we didn’t speak, nor did I see her for very long, but she seemed concerned and in a hurry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you know where she was headed?” Kaito asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “Simply out of the cafeteria, but when I went to the kitchen, I noticed there were two knives missing from their holder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Two knives,” breathes Tenko. “So… Kirumi and her killer had one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki nods. “That makes the most sense. And judging by Kirumi’s demeanor when I saw her, it’s likely whoever the culprit is seems to have taken their knife first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta frowns in thought. “So her killer knew she was going to attack them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe they were also planning on committing a murder,” says Ryoma. “If both of them took weapons, it seems neither of them was entirely innocent in this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaito. “Is there anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Maki. “I returned to my lab for the rest of the night. However, before I went to bed, I discovered a plate I had missed when I was cleaning. When I went back to the kitchen to return it, only one knife was missing.” She looks up at the surrounding faces staring in awe at her. “It was a little after half past twelve at night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo points a finger. “So that means the murder took place between nine-forty and twelve-thirty at night. The Monokuma File purposefully left out the time of death to keep things fair between us and the killer, so we can only assume this time frame reveals the killer’s identity.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you were keepin’ all of this really important shit to yourself because…?” asks Miu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns her cold eyes on her. “It brings unnecessary suspicion on me. And that is something I would prefer not to deal with.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t let a single muscle waver when she finally says, “I had my reasons to doubt you. Don’t pretend I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” says Maki. “And exacerbating those would only lead to needless arguing, though I suppose it’s too late for that now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Kaito. “Can we stop doubting her now? I really don’t fucking think she would share something like that if she was the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Yeah, you’re probably right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kokichi laughs. “Ah, Kaede, you seem so disappointed. It’d be really easy if the killer just happened to be someone you hate, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe I did let my own feelings get the better of me,” says Kaede. “But I still believe no one here deserves to die, even if they did kill someone. My personal feelings towards the culprit don’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gives her an odd look. “You believe no one here deserves to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I do,” she says. “Killing is completely unforgivable, but no one deserves to be executed for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “Is that really what you think? But what about your ‘justice’ you mentioned earlier? Was that just a lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know why you’re wasting time questioning me on this,” Kaede huffs. “Especially since we’ve been arguing for so long, and we still don’t have a suspect in mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we have to be nearing the end, right?” Himiko asks. “I think I missed lunch… I’m so hungry…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just a little longer, Himiko,” Tenko assures. “We now have a timeframe for the murder, and Tenko believes we have discussed almost every clue in detail.” She looks to Kaede. “There isn’t a lot of evidence left, so,” she fidgets, “should we discuss the thing that happened earlier? With the videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces. “Probably. It’s not likely to be a coincidence, and we’re kind of running into a dead end here now, so,” she straightens her shoulders. “Okay everyone, I have one more, potentially important clue.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises her eyebrows. “So you’ve been hiding key evidence this entire time, as well?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Looks like you two have more in common than you think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just rolls her eyes. “Anyway, I’ve been hesitant to share this for… reasons unrelated to the trial, but the night we received out motive videos, Tenko, Kaito, and I agreed it would be safer if I held on to all of our videos in my backpack.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which did keep them safe from a certain awful boy during the bug appreciation party,” Tenko adds. Kokichi responds with a beaming smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“However,” Kaede continues. “This morning when I was checking my Monopad, I discovered one of them went missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has been thinking about it quite a bit,” she says. “And she has come to the conclusion that the video was likely stolen from Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but who would do something like that?” Angie asks, before steepling her hands above her head. “Hmm, hmm, God says it’s likely connected to the killer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Of fucking course it is. Who the fuck else would want to do something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe this simply creates more mysteries,” Korekiyo interjects. “After all, what would the culprit have to gain by doing such a thing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Ryoma says adjusting his hat. “The culprit left both Tenko’s and Kirumi’s videos at the crime scene. Even though we don’t know who got which one, we can assume at least of them belonged to the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta thinks he understands,” he says. “The culprit probably stole a video from Kaede so they would have one if we just tried to check the videos. Does… does that sound right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “It makes a lot of damn sense at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pales. “But we almost did… we almost played right into the killer’s hands…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo tenses. “I apologize for suggesting such a thing. It appears I fell for the killer’s trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” says Kaito. “Don’t fucking beat yourself up. You couldn’t have known.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, thank you,” says Kiibo. “But I also feel I must apologize for much of my behavior. It seems… both Kirumi and the killer used me to get away with their actions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How the fuck is that your fault?” Miu asks. “It’s not your fault they’re assholes. You couldn’t have fucking done anything in the first place—you haven’t done anything wrong, far as I’m concerned.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo blinks at her. “Uh, thank you, Miu. That is very kind of you to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu suddenly freezes. “Y-yeah. D-don’t mention it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow,” Kokichi says, eyes filled with wonder. “That’s so gross.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi!” says Tenko. “Tenko orders you to stop being rude!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “But they’re so disgusting and <i>so</i> distracting! How can I focus with them around when they’re all over each other?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo yells, “I-Miu and I have done nothing wrong!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re so loud and so distracting!” Kokichi cries again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko starts reprimanding him again, but the gears in Kaede’s mind begin to turn. Very deliberately she says, “Kokichi, are you trying to give us a hint?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he hums. “What are you talking about? Is there even anything to give a hint about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Gonta isn’t sure,” Gonta chimes in. “But there are plenty of things about the missing motive video we don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There are…” Kaede agrees. “And the main thing is that we don’t know when it was taken, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got something, Kaede?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She closes her eyes to think. “Whoever took the video,” Kaede says slowly, “didn’t have very many opportunities to steal it. I mean, I definitely would have noticed someone rifling through my backpack while I was wearing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Kaede wears it most of the time, except for,” her eyes widen, “except for when we’re at training.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if someone tried to take it when we’re training, we’d fucking notice, right?” asks Kaito. “I mean, there’s no fucking animals or anything, so if we heard any sounds of someone creeping around, we’d definitely spot ‘em immediately.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what if we were distracted?” says Kaede suddenly. “What if we were distracted by a malfunctioning robot running straight out of the dorms?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” says Kiibo. “Was also the distraction?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu suddenly slams her hands on her podium. “I just fucking realized something! Everybody—shut the fuck up and listen!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is it, Miu?” asks Kiibo. “Did you remember something about last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kinda,” she says. “So, like, I’m a genius and I’m right about everything, yeah? Everyone fucking knows that, but earlier Kiibs kept arguing with me about him stepping on a branch outside, which scared the fucking shit out of me. And he kept saying he didn’t do it, so what if he fucking didn’t?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “The only people who should have been outside were Tenko, Kaede, Kaito, Kiibo, and Miu. The branch snapped while Tenko, Kaede, and Kaito were altogether, and Tenko did not hear any of us do it. And if it was not Kiibo or Miu, then that means…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was fucking someone else outside!?” Kaito shouts. “That’s fucking creepy!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Also, if I remember right, Kirumi had swept the path clear of debris like branches a few days ago, which means the only place you could step on a branch is if you were hiding in the bushes or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes bulge. “Does that mean the killer was watching us from the bushes the whole time just waiting for a chance to take the video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Ryoma suddenly. “I have a theory—if the killer wanted the video that badly, would they really just leave it to chance that there would be a moment when you were all distracted?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably not,” says Kaede. “Do you think they planned Kiibo’s malfunction then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not necessarily planned it,” says Ryoma. “But they probably knew it was going to happen and were waiting for it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but Kirumi’s the one who sabotaged Kiibo, right?” says Angie. “Did she tell the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “That is odd, is it not? I find it rather difficult to believe Kirumi would share the finer details of her plan with her killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” says Himiko. “Were you guys distracted for a really long time? ‘Cause the killer’d have to go back to the dorms or sneak around somewhere else after grabbing the video, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How did the killer get back to the dorms?” Tsumugi muses. “Were they just planning on being sneaky? Or did were they going to wait it out for you to finish?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a good question,” Kaede says. “How was the killer planning on getting back to the dorms? I…” she frowns, “I don’t know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko claps her hands. “Alright everyone, let’s all work together to help, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks at her. “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede has been working hard to get us through this trial,” Tenko continues. “And now we all need to work together to help her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta will try his hardest!” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, that’s what I was gonna say!” shouts Kaito.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “You were gonna say big dick should try his hardest? Well, whatever, I don’t wanna die, so I’ll try or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clasps her hands. “Oh wow! It’s almost like I get to be a real cool detective in a visual novel! Okay, I’ll help, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In that case,” Tenko says. “Let’s all try our hardest and think of a solution together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The culprit had to get back to the dorms somehow, yeah?” Kaito says. “How would they do that if we were outside the whole time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, what if,” Tsumugi begins, “they just waited near the school for you to finish, and went back then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma crosses his arms. “But if they did that, they’d risk just hanging out and being suspicious if anyone happened to come by.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe they had a really good hiding spot?” Angie asks. “Or maybe they had another distraction planned!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does not recall any other distractions,” she says. “If there was one, Tenko likely would have been… distracted by it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, the three of you are real fucking loud,” Miu says. “Maybe they just counted on that and snuck past.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito yells. “I’m not fucking loud!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shouts, “Tenko is not loud either!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y’know,” says Ryoma. “As much as I hate to agree with Miu, she’s got a point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” she shouts before suddenly becoming offended. “Hey, what do you mean ‘hate to agree?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaede. “I think Miu’s right. The most likely possibility is that the killer just snuck past us. I mean, it’d be pretty risky to just keep hiding in the bushes. If I had discovered the video was missing when we were outside, we would have all started searching for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then we would have caught the fucking killer right then and there,” says Kaito smacking his forehead. “Damnit. We could’ve ended this immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait a minute,” says Tenko. “Tenko just realized something else important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know who the killer is, Tenko?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “No, but Tenko realized that we can narrow our timeframe further. If the killer was outside with us when Kiibo’s malfunction happened, that means they had already finished preparing the crime scene at eleven.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow and looks out across at her assembled classmates. She squares her shoulders, takes a deep breath, and tells herself she’s doing the right thing. “Okay,” she says. “There are still a few things I’m not quite sure about, but with all of the information we’ve discussed, I think I know who the killer is. Or at least,” her eyes linger of her suspect. “I’m suspicious of them enough that I want to hear what they have to say.”</span></p>

The next chapter might be a bit shorter than usual, though there's always the execution and other post-trial stuff, which will hopefully also be interesting!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kiibo,” Kaede begins. “Can you repeat your entire testimony from last night one more time? Starting with when you woke up? I want to check one last thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” he says nodding. “It was around eleven or so at night I believe when I began to get error messages that something was wrong. I admittedly panicked a bit more than necessary, but quickly exited the dormitories to find Miu for help. I ran into her when she was walking back from lab near where I believe your training spot is, and… I ended up startling her a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu chooses to interject, “Nearly fucking pissed myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo appears to take her comment in stride continuing on, “Sorry again, Miu. But,” he turns back to Kaede. “I believe Miu then took me to her lab until approximately four in the morning for cleaning.” He frowns. “We’ve already been over this a few times… but was any of that useful?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sets her hat forward on her head. “Yes, thank you. Just one more question, though: Miu was the first person you saw when you left your room, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Correct.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay then,” she takes a deep breath and prepares to condemn another person to death. “Hey, Korekiyo, what were you doing when Kiibo left his room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He turns to her. “I was simply observing from my usual spot,” he says. “Why do you ask, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, I have a problem with that,” says Kaede. “Since it sounds like Kiibo definitely didn’t see you.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds like an accusation, Kaede,” says Korekiyo. “Do you suspect me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m afraid that I’m beginning to,” says Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Very well. I’d like to hear your reasoning, then, if you don’t mind, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at the reaction. “Uh, sure. Of course.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito places a hand on his hip. “Dude, you’re being really fucking calm for someone being accused of murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo simply crosses his arms. “Perhaps I am. Though, personally, I feel I have little to worry about.” He presses a hand to the side of his face. “Now then, being suspected of murder is quite an interesting experience. Could you continue your deductions, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh God,” Miu pulls a face. “Is he fucking getting off on this shit or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His attention turns to her. “Miu, I believe I wasn’t talking to you. It is very rude to intrude on other people’s conversations.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Kokichi laughs. “The pig really should shut her gross mouth, huh? It’d be really boring if we just got stuck listening to her again, sooo,” he turns to Kaede as well, “what do you have to say Kaede? Why do you think Korekiyo did it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence falls over the others and the attention of the room turns almost unanimously to Kaede, and all at once the flood of guilt from the last trial and the last execution come over her. She glances towards Korekiyo who seems even calmer than Shuichi had when death loomed over his head. There isn’t a hint of anger in his expression, and Kaede speaks only to the odd but kind boy she remembers talking with almost every night since Shuichi’s death.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She opens her mouth to say, “Actually, um, maybe we should keep thinking. It… might still be too early to accuse someone. Sorry, Korekiyo. I shouldn’t have jumped to conclu—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, boo!” says Kokichi, leaning forward tiny hands in fists. “No takesies-backsies, Kaede!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s too bewildered by his sudden words to respond with anything but, “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just when we were getting to the super fun part of accusing someone, you back out,” Kokichi says, puffing out his cheeks. “You ruined all the fun last time, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” says Maki. “You’re implying Kaede is choosing to defend the culprit yet again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will take that as you suspecting me as well then, Maki,” says Korekiyo. “However, forgive me, but I would prefer to hear the proper reasoning from someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glances to him, red eyes narrowed, but voice still emotionless. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He merely shrugs, but looks back to Kaede. “My own personal preference, I’m afraid. The details aren’t mine to share.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Kokichi. “Looks like Korekiyo doesn’t like Maki either!” He laughs. “Wow, and here I thought I was the least well liked student.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta gasps. “Don’t say that, Kokichi! Gonta likes you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “You really shouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No kidding,” Kaito agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “Aw, Kaito… do you like Maki more than me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “I like fucking everyone more than you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kokichi presses two fingers to his temple and twists his face into something dark. “Even the killer? Are you going to protect them, too, then? Are you going to run away from your beloved truth like Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sparks back to life at the sound of her name. “I’m not running!” she immediately retorts. “I’m…” images of Shuichi being dragged away flash through her mind. “I’m just being careful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you choosing to retract your earlier statements then?” Korekiyo asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her head snaps back to him, and she finds herself at a loss for words. Kaede opens and closes her mouth and finally says, “I think… that no one deserves to die, and we should think through this more carefully before voting for anyone at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” says Tenko. “Sorry if Tenko is mistaken, but are you suggesting we… don’t vote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-wait!” shouts Miu. “I-if we do some nonsense like that, w-won’t we all get executed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I am afraid I have to agree, and,” he shakes his head. “Though I understand Kirumi was… perhaps not the person I thought she was, my inner voice is still telling me to find justice for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it matters,” says Korekiyo almost conversationally. “I would not mind continuing on as we are, and I say this as the one accused. However,” he stretches out his arms, “this is a truly fascinating turn of events, I must say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t stop herself from snapping at him. “How can you say that!? If you are the culprit—if anyone here is the culprit—we’re—!” she stomps her foot, “—then we’re all murderers! Don’t you guys understand?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scoffs. “You truly are a bleeding heart. However even you must be aware that siding with the culprit for your own ideals will only cause us all to suffer, right?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede expects another quip from him, but Kokichi simply stares at her curiously. “Rebel against the school trial…” he tilts his head. “Perhaps you’re not as boring as I thought, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles and folds his hands behind his head. “You know what? Sure! If you don’t want to vote, I won’t vote either. Your call, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t listen to him, Kaede,” says Kaito immediately. “I don’t know what the fuck he’s planning but it’s definitely a trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “Never! Am I the kind of person who would try to trick poor Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You… definitely are,” says Kaede, but she can’t help herself from fidgeting with Shuichi’s hat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kukuku,” Korekiyo laughs. “This is quite interesting. I have to admit I had no idea I was this well liked among my peers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh!” Angie shouts. “Angie likes Korekiyo, too, buuut, buuut, buuut, God says we should still make extra sure he isn’t the culprit first before we decide not to vote for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Naturally,” Korekiyo agrees with an incline of his head. “You have a very prudent God, after all, Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo speaks up again. “I must agree. Kaede, I understand your apprehension, but we must continue forward for the good of everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Except for the culprit!” says Kokichi, laughing. “Man, Kiiboy has no sense of sympathy, huh? But I guess he is just a useless robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He jabs a finger towards Kokichi. “Do not say such things! And!” he grips his podium, “Were you not the one who said we should not sympathize with culprits in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi taps a finger to his chin. “Huh? Did I say something like that? Hmm… I was probably lying,” he grins, “or maybe I’m lying now. But a robot like you probably couldn’t figure out which one is which.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, quit the crap!” Kaito shouts. “Kaede,” he looks to her. “You think Korekiyo did it, yeah? Well, why don’t we figure out if he did fucking do it or not?” He slams his fists together. “We need to find justice for Kirumi, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right!” Tsumugi adds in. “We can’t simply give up just because…” she takes a shaky breath, “because this is all so cruel.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “Yup! God says it’s super important that we vote for someone. Sorry, Korekiyo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No need to apologize,” he answers. “I have decided I am fine with any outcome we come to, though I would prefer a proper trial if I am to be chosen as Kirumi’s murderer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Like Kaito said, you are way too calm for this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Perhaps I am,” Korekiyo says. “Now then, Kaede, I’d still like to hear your reasons for suspecting me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at him. Part of her reminds herself that she barely knows Korekiyo. Another part says that she barely knew Shuichi. And then one more part reminds her that finding the answer to the trial might be completely meaningless, and another one of her friends will die brutally anyway. Kaede says, “Are you asking me to kill you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” says Tenko. “Tenko understands that you are nervous, but remember we are not all counting on you—we are all working together.” She addresses the rest of the group. “If we make a mistake, it is everyone’s fault for not trying their hardest, not just Kaede’s. So Tenko believes we should all work together,” she glances towards Korekiyo. “Even Korekiyo, if he is willing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Everyone working together for mutual survival… I believe I can support that, even if it would result in a rather unfortunate end for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Seriously,” says Ryoma. “Why aren’t you panicking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo tuts at him. “My reasons are my own. And as I have said before, I am satisfied with every outcome. I have been for some time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means that I believe we should continue are discussion,” Korekiyo says. “Tenko, you seem to be taking the lead, too, now, and I would be interested to hear arguments from you as well. What are your thoughts?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pulls a face at being addressed. “Tenko thinks…” she glances to Kaede. “That we should first establish if Korekiyo has an alibi or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” he says with a nod. “Now we should begin with last night then, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Tenko. “Kaede, will you help Tenko? Even if you are nervous, Tenko believes we can find the answer if we work together and share the responsibility with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at Tenko’s expression of pure understanding from under the brim of Shuichi’s hat before taking a deep breath and pushing it up. “I… yes,” she turns back towards all of her assembled classmates. “We need to find the answer. We need to find justice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others begin to talk, and Kaede misses the way Kokichi’s gleaming expression falters to one of disgust.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to address your reason for suspecting me first,” says Korekiyo. “Which was the fact that Kiibo did not see me when he left the dorms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” says Kiibo. “I was admittedly in a rather frantic state, but I did not see you, suggesting you were somewhere else when the video was stolen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So I don’t want to side with the gimp,” Miu interjects, “but Kiibs, you were freaking the fuck out, and it is dark as shit when you leave the dorms at night. Maybe you just missed tall, dark, and kinky?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo presses a hand to his chin. “That is always a possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Kaito. “Maybe we’re thinking about this wrong. Like, who even fucking knew about Kaede holding the motive videos in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You did!” Miu shouts jabbing a finger at him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut the fuck up!” Kaito shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please do not swear at Miu,” scolds Kiibo. “She is simply trying her best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu flushes. “K-Kiibs…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pulls a face. “You guys are gross.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s it!” shouts Kaede suddenly. “Kaito, that’s it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” he asks. “That Miu and Kiibo are gross?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, not that,” Kaede waves her hand. “The part about the motive videos. It’s actually been bugging me since we started the investigation, and I realized one was missing. Himiko actually brought it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The girl in question blinks. “I did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” says Tenko. “Tenko remembers that during the investigation, Himiko asked about who knew that Kaede was holding on to multiple motive videos in her backpack.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” she drawls. “I guess I did… I’m really figuring out a lot this investigation…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tenko agrees. “Himiko has been absolutely vital to all of our discoveries.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, maybe not all of them,” Kaede gently corrects. “But, the point is that the only people who knew about the motive videos should have been me, Tenko, and Kaito, and,” she glances towards him, “possibly Korekiyo. He was watching our training sessions, so it’s likely he saw us trading them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Oh yeah, I even remember, like, walking the fuck past him with mine when I went back to my room to get it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means,” Kaede continues. “That whether Korekiyo is the one who stole one of the videos or not, he definitely at the very least knew about it, and knew about an opportunity to take one when I wouldn’t be wearing my backpack.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Ryoma. “What do you have to say for yourself, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “Attempting to deny my seeing Kaito leave the dorms with his motive video would be a rather fruitless endeavor, wouldn’t it? As such, I will concede this point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “You’re… admitting to stealing one of the videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he shakes his head. “I am admitting to being aware that Kaito gave his video to you. However, I am also proposing that Kaito and Tenko are not the quietest of people. There is always a chance that someone else caught wind of Kaede holding on to their videos due to them simply raising their voices or speaking of it at inadvisable times.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko was really careful,” she protests. “She didn’t even tell Himiko. So if that happened, it was probably someone else…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito shouts. “I didn’t fuck up, either!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki, of all people, snorts before quickly looking away from him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki!” he says. “C’mon, you know me! Would I be that careless to just randomly yell something as fucking important as that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She regards him out of the corner of her eyes. “Do you want me to answer that honestly?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Ooh, Kaito just got shot down again!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not even fucking talking to you!” he yells back. “<i>Anyway</i> we know Korekiyo knew about us giving our videos to Kaede. Is that enough to prove he’s the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip and steals a glance at Korekiyo, still composed as ever. “I think,” she says. “We should still keep talking. There’s more I’d like to hear his response to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, of course,” says Tsumugi. “We need to make sure we’re absolutely certain we get the culprit right, so if there’s any unanswered questions we should probably go over them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kiibo says. “We cannot let anything stop us from ensuring we discover the true culprit. Our margin of error was far too close for comfort last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Can we all stop pretending we don’t know who’s to blame for that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” says Tenko. “Tenko would like to apologize in advance for saying this, but please stop talking. Attempting to assign blame for the events of the last trial will only drag us off our current topic. In case you have forgotten, Kaede is not our current suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Ryoma. “Korekiyo is. And I happened to think of another pretty damning thing against him after mulling it over a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Korekiyo asks. “What do you have to say Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives him a wary look, but continues on to say, “Talking about the only people who should know stuff got me thinking. Remember when I was suspected for having stuff happen in my lab? Well, how many people even knew about that room in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let’s see,” says Kaito. “Me and Kaede found it, so us. And also everyone who happened to be looking around the pool, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Which was me, Tsumugi, and Korekiyo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, Tsumugi, and Korekiyo,” Kaede muses. “Wait… I just… thought of something else, too. Tsumugi, you got your own motive video, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods hesitantly. “I… did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I know whose motive videos Kaito and I got,” Kaede continues. “And Ryoma’s, too, since he tried to trade with Gonta. So almost everyone’s accounted for then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns. “I don’t get it. Who’s accounted for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I was just thinking about how the culprit had to have been given either Kirumi or Tenko’s motive video,” replies Kaede. “And almost everyone who knew about the hidden room actually told me whose video they got at some point or another.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah, huh?” says Kaito. “Man, we’re really shit at keeping secrets…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu waves her hand. “Me and Kiibs fucking got each other’s and we already traded, so that means neither of us can be the killer!” She thrusts a finger at Kokichi. “So some little twink here should stop fucking accusing us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi beams back at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Didn’t I just fucking say you guys are shit at keeping secrets?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, Miu,” says Kaede. “When exactly did you and Kiibo trade videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” she twists a piece of hair between her fingers. “At lunch before big dick’s rampage. Y’know before we went to the fucking bathroom—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-right!” Kaede quickly cuts her off. “A-and, do you remember who else was there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “Well, fucking me and Kiibs. I didn’t really pay too much attention to the other losers hanging around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “It was me, Kirumi, and… Korekiyo.” He looks over to the tall boy. “That’s actually where I got the idea of the motive video’s being a one-to-one trade into my head.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kaede prompts. “I know it was a while ago, but… did either of them seem to react to Miu and Kiibo trading videos?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma crosses his arms. “This could just be me seeing things that aren’t there, thanks to hindsight, but Kirumi at least seemed interested.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo shifts from foot to foot. “She did… often mention that she liked knowing there were people depending on her… do you think she tried to trade for her video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know if we have enough information to say for certain,” says Kaede. “Especially since I know Tenko didn’t have Kirumi’s video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, how about it, Tenko?” Angie asks. “God wants to know if Kirumi ever asked you to trade videos. Did she? Did she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi did not,” Tenko says. “So… does that mean we should stick to our earlier assumption that Kirumi got her own video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs on the brim of Shuichi’s hat in thought. “I guess. But… either way we know Kirumi probably ended up with her video at some point before her death, since we found it hidden away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait a minute,” says Kaito. “So, like, if Korekiyo is the fucking killer, does that mean he never saw his own video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “Though I am not currently inclined to answer the first part of that statement for obvious reasons, I will confirm that I never did watch my video or discover who had it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I did,” says Kaito.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The part of Korekiyo’s face Kaede can see suddenly grows the most irritated she has seen since the trial began. “Well then,” he says. “A bit of a shame I never figured that out, even after you walked right past me with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, I was keeping my part of the fucking deal to keep the videos secret until the screening or whatever,” he retorts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, sorry to interrupt,” says Tsumugi. “But speaking of videos and the screening, didn’t Kokichi break into everyone’s rooms to watch the videos? Shouldn’t he know who got whose?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to the small boy, still bearing a gleaming smile. “That’s right. So do you know, and you’ve just been keeping it a secret this whole time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head. “Oh? Why would I do a thing like that? I’m a team player, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede huffs. “Alright, that’s enough. No lies—just answer the question, please.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s wide eyes narrow. “Hmm… no lies? But will you believe me even if I say it’s the truth?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts almost automatically. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then there’s your answer,” Kokichi replies. “And it’s just as well, since I don’t know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh for fuck’s sake,” says Kaito. “You’re lying again, aren’t you? You know the goddamn answer, but you just want to make us all squirm or some shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “Well, then. If you think I’m not not not lying, then I guess I won’t talk to you anymore.” He folds his hands behind his head. “Yup, I don’t feel like talking to Kaito aaaanymoooore. Anyone else have a question?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have got to be fucking—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Kokichi says. “I just said I didn’t want to talk to you anymore! You have to give me space in our relationship! You’re suffocating me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s face begins to turn an interesting shade of red, so Kaede quickly interjects, “<i>Anyway</i> let’s just… come back to the videos later.” She shakes her head. “The reason I brought it up is because, Korekiyo,” and she steels herself as she turns to kill him, “you’re the only person who knew about the hidden room whose video isn’t accounted for. You’re the only person who was actively watching people coming and leaving the dorms that night. And you’re the only person who knew about me holding on to multiple motive videos.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Maki flatly. “What do you have to say to that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d say,” he says calmly. “That there is still one thing that you have yet to account for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede feels almost the weirdest sense of relief. “What is it?” she says, entirely too hopeful.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have an alibi,” Korekiyo replies. “You yourself saw me the night of Kirumi’s death logically when it was happening based on our time window.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “That’s right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… also remembers that,” she adds. “It was just at the start of nighttime when Kaede and Tenko saw Korekiyo at the dorms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “And if Kirumi’s murder took place from between roughly nine-forty and eleven, then I would plainly have to be in two places at once to be the culprit.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, fuck, wait,” says Kaito. “Remember that there was shit in the gym? Doesn’t that mean the culprit had to do stuff before nighttime started?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you all saw Korekiyo right at the beginning of nighttime,” Gonta chimes in. “Does that mean he didn’t do it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or it means he did everything in twenty minutes or less!” says Angie. “God’s super impressed at how fast that is!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” asks Himiko looking to Kaede. “Does that mean we’re wrong and need to find another suspect?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grips the edge of her podium and thinks as hard as she can, staring around at the confused and frustrated faces of everyone depending on her. Korekiyo still seems as unperturbed as ever, merely watching the reactions of their classmates evenly. The idea of being punished for being wrong terrifies her, but sentencing another one of her friends to death…<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a breath. “Everyone—I’m not wrong,” she looks directly to Korekiyo. “I am so, so sorry Korekiyo, but I know why your alibi doesn’t hold up, and,” she squeezes her eyes shut, “and I know you killed Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He raises his eyebrows. “Very well. Please continue, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His calmness kills her as the last debate starts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Korekiyo has an alibi,” Gonta begins earnestly. “Kaede and Tenko saw him at the beginning of nighttime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’d have to be lightening fast to kill Kirumi,” says Angie. “Maybe God helped him? But why would God help someone kill Kirumi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s because there’s evidence in the gym, right?” says Ryoma. “And you get kicked out at ten. And if Korekiyo is accounted for right at ten, then he just wouldn’t have enough time to be the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds right,” says Kaito. “I mean, it’s pretty hard to believe Kirumi would just let the killer pause their murder attempt or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo places a hand over his heart. “So we need to keep searching for the killer to find justice for Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Justice, schmustice,” says Kokichi. “What’s really important is that we keep the game going, right? Be a real shame if it ended here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “You’re awful! How can you say something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” says Kokichi. “How can Kiiboy say his platitudes with a straight face?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Justice is not a platitude!” Kiibo shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Pssh,” says Kokichi. “As if a useless robot would even know what justice is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede thinks about the justice in the murder she’s about to commit as she says, “Wait, Kaito, you’re completely right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He blinks. “About what? The killer… paused their fucking murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They did,” says Kaede. “We’ve talked a lot about how Kirumi… was not exactly innocent in this either, so we need to stop thinking about her as a helpless victim because we need to face that she plainly wasn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” says Tenko. “Are you suggesting Kirumi… cooperated with her killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” says Kaede. “The killer worked so hard to manipulate the crime scene to make it look like she was just a victim, but we know that isn’t true. So now we need to think about why the killer would go to all that trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “And the reason is that they were working together? Is that what you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Kirumi and her killer were working together…” Ryoma muses. “That would explain one thing that we still haven’t figured out.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that is?” prompts Miu.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The scene at the gym,” Ryoma continues. “We figured out why the spots of blood looked the way they did at the pool, but not at the gym. There’s no bloody footprints or anything, and if it was just a one-sided attack, wouldn’t one of them have run away or screamed for help or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Tsumugi. “A-and when the gym closed, they would have had the perfect chance to! But neither of them did… so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I knew that!” says Miu. “I already figured all of that out. I fucking knew from the start Kirumi and what’s his face just up and walked out of the gym holding hands or whatever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “It also finally explains the glove. Kirumi and Korekiyo likely still had weapons on them when they left the gym. If they wanted to carry them from the gym to Ryoma’s lab, they’d need a way to stop them from creating a trail of blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Himiko. “If they were mages, they’d just use magic, but instead Kirumi just put her knife in one of her gloves, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why there was blood smeared on the inside of it!” says Tenko. “Himiko’s deductions are amazing once again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-w-wait!” shouts Miu. “Wait a fucking second! If they were working together, and Kirumi let Shitguji leave to get his alibi, was she just doing that to fuck with our timeframe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito crosses his arms. “That makes a lot of sense. Oh!” he slams a fist into his palm. “And, so, like, Kirumi was probably planning on fucking winning their fight or whatever, right? So Korekiyo being seen at ten would completely fuck our sense of time for the murder if that happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, and the sabotage!” Angie cheers. “So, so like Korekiyo could sneak past you guys ‘cause he watched you all the time, right? But Kirumi didn’t, so, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta gasps. “Was she counting on Kiibo to distract them to get back to the dorms without being seen? Does that mean Kirumi really… was trying to commit murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “A lot of this is speculation, but… if it’s true, then it’s all starting to piece together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it means we found the answer to this case,” says Kaede. “Total cooperation between the killer and the victim.” She speaks only to Korekiyo. “So, that’s my complete and final reasoning. What do you have to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I say,” he replies calmly. “You’ve figured me out almost completely. I am quite impressed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises an eyebrow. “Is that a confession?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo merely nods. “I said before, I am content with any outcome. I don’t intend to go kicking and screaming as I have already completed my purpose.” He spreads his arms out to his sides and looks to the sky. “I have completed my purpose to the absolute best of my abilities and can move on to the next life with no regrets.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is left blinking. “Your purpose?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” he says. “I believe you figured out my methods almost exactly, though I am afraid my motives may still elude you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Care to share?” asks Kaito. “You did fucking kill someone, even if…” he frowns, “even if Kirumi accepted it, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi fought tooth and nail in our duel,” Korekiyo says. “She was someone of great import, after all, and her life was worth that of hundreds, and she wanted desperately to escape from this place. Our goals ended up aligning almost perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Goals?” Angie tilts her head. “Angie’s getting confused, and God says that someone should start explaining things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her hat. “I suppose… that we have a confession, but I’d like to quickly summarize everything we know… to ensure there are no mistakes,” she bites her lip, “and that Korekiyo really did kill Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “The floor is yours, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“First,” Kaede begins. “Right before nighttime, Kirumi and Kiibo were cleaning in the hallway on the second floor. But, at that point, Kirumi had likely already spoken with the culprit and was already planning a murder of her own. For her plan to work later on so she could sneak back to the dorms, Kirumi used the opportunity to sabotage Kiibo by filling one of his fans with some of the debris they were sweeping up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A fuckton of dead bugs!” Miu calls out before quickly being shushed by Kaito.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Next, Kirumi went to the kitchen to get a weapon,” Kaede continues. “On her way back, Maki, who was returning plates to the kitchen happened to see her, though Kirumi didn’t notice. Maki also saw that a second knife was gone from the kitchen, meaning the killer had already taken their weapon by that point. This was at roughly fifteen or so minutes before nighttime, and we can only assume Kirumi and the killer met at the gym where they began their fight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“However, due to the nighttime rule, they had to leave before ten, and at this point, they probably agreed on going to an out of the way location that the killer likely suggested—the secret room in the back of Ryoma’s lab, also,” she looks towards Korekiyo standing serenely as she rattles off his crimes, “the killer ended up parting ways with Kirumi so they could appear at the dorms to establish an alibi for the night.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the hidden room, Kirumi likely placed her motive video that she was carrying to protect it or maybe to motivate herself in the back of one of the showers to retrieve later, as well as the glove she had used to move her weapon without it dripping blood. When the killer arrived later after sneaking past me, Tenko, and Kaito due to having observed our movements for the last few nights, the two probably started fighting again. And the killer won… though if Kirumi had won, she would be the killer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After Kirumi’s death, the killer placed Tenko’s motive video in Kirumi’s apron in order to frame her. However, the killer also wanted to hide the crime scene and hide the fact that they had worked together with Kirumi, since it would ruin their alibi if we found out,” she takes a breath, “to do that they took down the tennis net in Ryoma’s lab and used it to carefully lower the body out the window and into the pool room. They also threw one of the knives down, to make it seem like a one-sided attack.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The killer then likely took a moment to clean themselves up from the fight, as well as wash any blood off the net and the second knife that they then returned to the kitchen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re not gonna use that knife to fucking eat food anymore, right?” Miu interjects.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, not now, Miu,” Kiibo shushes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits for silence before continuing. “The killer then likely snuck to our training spot and hid in the bushes, waiting for Kiibo’s malfunction to start, and when it did, they grabbed one of the motive videos I had been carrying from my backpack. They ended up stepping on a branch, though we all assumed that it was something Kiibo had done at the time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Finally,” she says. “The killer snuck their way back to the dorms, in order to make it seem like they had simply been there the whole night, and the only person the killer could be,” and her victory almost feels like one of defeat, “is Korekiyo Shinguji. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nearly perfect,” he answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Maki. “Now that we’ve wasted enough time with that, perhaps we should begin voting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kaede freezes. “Wait. Just because we know who the killer is, doesn’t mean we should vote for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s stare becomes deadly. “You never listen do you? If we don’t vote for the killer—that you found yourself—then we will all die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if we vote for Korekiyo,” Kaede protests. “Then we might as well be killing him ourselves! We’ll be no better than Monokuma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll be alive,” says Maki. “And even if anyone here shares your half-baked ideals, I believe they’d prefer to keep living.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede shouts. “Don’t you get it? This isn’t just cruel—this is wrong! Korekiyo is our friend, and we’re condemning him to die to save ourselves. Can’t any of you understand that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The silence that meets her roars with meaning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo’s the one to break the quiet, and it nearly kills Kaede on the spot. “Kaede, I must say that I am truly blown away by your compassion, however, I already said that I fully accept this outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How can you say that?” Kaede begs him. “Why aren’t you fighting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Simple,” Korekiyo says. “With Kirumi’s death, I have achieved something I previously thought my imprisonment here had crushed any chances of completing. Now, I can die with no regrets.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re still going to die,” Kaede argues. “You’re going to be executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which admittedly is not the most preferable way to go, I am aware,” Korekiyo says. “And I also must say your unyielding sympathy for me is beginning to make me regret not being able to introduce you to my sister as well, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing of great import now that it has already been completed,” Korekiyo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Man you guys talk a lot!” Monokuma yells out from his chair. “Even after you have a confession, you insist on yapping on and on! So let’s get this voting show on the road!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grits her teeth as she stares up at the bear. “I’m not voting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we’ll have a second execution!” Monokuma declares. “Two for one deal!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says gently. “Tenko knows you don’t want to, but you’ll die if you don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clenches her fists. “I know, but I’m not about to be responsible for anyone else’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re going to make everyone else carry the burden then?” says Maki. “That’s rather hypocritical of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” says Kaede. “Stop talking like you understand what it means to feel guilty over someone’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face turns dark. “What was that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says hurriedly. “Listen, we all get that this is a fucking shitty situation, but you can’t just fucking throw your life away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Is this the part where you bring up Shuichi’s death to guilt her into voting? That’d be rather manipulative of you, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s stomach ties itself into knots at the familiar thought of Shuichi’s execution. Kaito clenches his fists. “I wasn’t going to fucking do anything like that!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki just shakes her head. “This is ridiculous. Can we start yet? The only person who has a problem isn’t even the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins to grow desperate. “Guys, come on. Think—what would happen if we all refused to vote? There wouldn’t even be a majority to decide if we got it right or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “We’d all be executed anyway, right? Isn’t that in the rules?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says again. “Tenko understands your feelings, but it is not worth your life. And,” she tries to smile, “Tenko thought of something else. While it is against the rules not to vote, you can still always vote wrong. There is no punishment for that as long as enough people vote for the culprit. As after all, nearly half of us voted incorrectly the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “So Kaede can throw away her vote and claim the moral high ground while we all do her dirty work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have to say,” Korekiyo weighs in. “That argument is deeply amusing coming from you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Maki snaps her head towards him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing,” he replies. “It is not my place to tell.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma huffs. “Are any of you brats listening? C’mon! It’s time to vote, vote, vote! Will your choice be the right one? Or the dreadfully wrong one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The small screen on Kaede’s podium lights up in front of her, and she accepts her hypocrisy as she votes for herself for a second time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The results come in much faster than last time, and with the exception of her one vote, it is unanimous for Korekiyo. The students gather to the side of the stands, and Kaede does not miss the look of disgust Maki gives her. But then Maki is blocked from view, and Korekiyo stands in front of her with a motive video in his bandaged hands. Kaede blinks up at the tall boy. “The video you took?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” he replies calmly. “I am unsure how much time Monokuma will give me, so I decided to do my most important task first.” He presses it into her hands. “I simply picked a video at random when taking one, though this one certainly was revealing.” He looks at Maki from the corner of his eyes. “If I was you, Kaede, I believe I would present its information sooner rather than later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you,” she replies, calmly taking the video from him. “And… I know. I’ll probably do it right after this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “See that you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Korekiyo,” Kaito calls out. “Feel like explaining yourself? You kind of having nothing left to lose, and you did kill the prime minister of Japan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” he replies evenly. “But, in my defense, I believe the prime minister would have killed me if I had not suggested cooperation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo waves a finger. “Think what you will of me, but I am not a dumb man. Right before the bug appreciation party, I approached Kirumi to trade videos as I had assumed from Kiibo and Miu’s switch that the videos were simply one-to-one. Later, when I discovered Kirumi had lied about having my video, and with the knowledge of hers, there was little doubt in my mind that she would try to attack me, since I alone knew her secret.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Gonta says. “Korekiyo had Kirumi’s video in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” he says. “And after viewing it, I felt compelled as a citizen to give it to her, and I admittedly also had my own plans at that point. The way Kirumi described her life as being worth that of hundreds simply secured the decision for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what?” Kaito asks. “You just fucking decided to fight or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “I weighed my options, certainly, and discovered that every outcome to a duel would be acceptable for me. If I lost, then I would be assisting the prime minister in escaping imprisonment. If I won and was not discovered, then I would succeed in my goal and leave here alive. If I won the duel and was found out, then I would still succeed in my goal and move on to the next life to be with my dearly departed sister.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kirumi just agreed?” Angie asks. “Did God tell her to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mostly believe she agreed because cooperation of the victim—in this case, me—would have created a murder that would be much easier for her to clean up and prevent the risk of finding a victim who would attempt to run or seek help,” he says. “It was a mutually beneficial situation for the both of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo steps forward. “I understand that, but what is this goal that you keep talking about? Why would it benefit you to harm Kirumi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo just crosses his arms. “I’m afraid that is a secret I will take to my grave. Though I may be a dead man walking, I am not compelled to answer your every question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup!” cheers Monokuma. “And I personally am tired of chatty dead men! So let’s get to it!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Korekiyo simply bows. “Well then, I believe that is my cue. It was truly a pleasure to observe you all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo walks almost peacefully to his execution, and Kaede finds that she can’t bear to watch when the cauldron begins to boil. Through her fingers, she sees the odd image of the green Monokuma Kub shove the yellow one into the fire, and then another classmate she killed goes up in flames.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s the first to speak, shaking his head. “Fuck man. At least he was okay with it, I guess, but still,” he lets out a sigh. “Fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu trembles on the spot. “W-what you get for fucking killing someone… w-why w-would anyone ever risk that shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his hat with a sign. “You can’t just assume to know what another person’s going through. Seems like both Korekiyo and Kirumi had a lot more going on than we could have ever guessed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s near tears. “Kirumi and Korekiyo were still our friends though, right? Even though they both tried to escape, they were still our friends?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to think so,” Ryoma says quietly. “I guess we can’t know for sure, but we can only assume they wouldn’t have done what they did if they weren’t put into this situation in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right!” Tsumugi says. “We can’t forget that Monokuma is still our real enemy, not each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “Is that what you think? So should we all just believe in each other then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course we should,” says Kaito. “All we need to do is trust each other and work together, and we can stop this shit from ever happening again!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But didn’t Ryoma just say you can’t guess what someone else is thinking?” Kokichi replies. “So doesn’t that mean any of us could be planning something? Maybe someone’s planning something right now, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “I don’t know what the hell you’re going on about, but I’m not about to listen to a little liar like you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone!” Kiibo says clapping his hands. “Please stop fighting! This is exactly what Monokuma wants us to do. Though things have been difficult, we did manage to get through this trial successfully. Now is not the time to turn on each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then when is the time to turn on each other?” Kokichi asks, tilting his head. “When the next motive comes? Or when someone else decides to reveal they’re secretly really important to the outside world?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” says Kaede, finally finding her voice. “I don’t know what you’re trying to do, but you should stop talking about Kirumi and Korekiyo like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh? And why should I?” he says. “Thanks to them, this trial had the worst possible outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t understand,” she says. “We picked the right answer, and Korekiyo even seemed okay with his death, even if it was horrible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” cheers Angie. “From that perspective, this trial had the very best outcome!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s wrong,” Kokichi says simply. “A trial that ends with everyone playing by the rules and us all coming together and holding hands is by far the worst thing that can happen. And I,” an evil smile falls over his face, “intend to stop that from happening ever again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips to the elevator without another word, even when Kaito begins shouting curses after him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie takes the moment to clasp her hands together. “God doesn’t know what’s coming next, but he has told Angie to work extra hard to make sure everyone comes together peacefully.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta hopes that we can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, don’t hope Gonta,” Angie says. “Believe! And God and Angie will do everything to make sure we can all keep living together in peace.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Kaede. “We all need to keep working and living together. No matter what happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede pushes the brim of Shuichi’s hat up as she moves forward to lead the group to the awkward elevator ride back up. Kokichi greets them all with a beaming grin, and they reach their destination in silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But at the top as everyone begins to file out, Kaede takes a deep breath as the weight of the motive video in her hands starts to become too heavy to keep holding alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With everyone still gathered, Kaede says, “Wait, everyone, I have one more thing I need to announce.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can it be fast?” Himiko asks. “We argued all through breakfast… I’m so hungry…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows nervously. “It will be quick, trust me. I just need to share the real reason why I proposed us having a screening for the motive videos.” She takes a deep breath and looks towards Maki. “Someone among us has been lying about their talent. And their real talent is very, very dangerous. I know because I got their motive video, so there’s no doubt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko moves closer to her side protectively as Maki suddenly seems less like a human and more like a machine suddenly turning on. Kaede says, “Maki isn’t the Ultimate Child Caregiver. She’s the Ultimate—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And suddenly Kaede finds it impossible to breathe as two strong hands wind themselves around her neck and her feet leave the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s red eyes stare into hers with a look of pure rage for a second before Tenko speeds forward to shove herself into Maki’s side with all her strength.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede falls to the ground, gasping for breath, and the other students explode into sound. Tenko’s in a battle stance between her and Maki, who is still staring at Kaede with an expression of death. Kaito begins shouting. Ryoma moves to Tenko’s side while Kiibo jumps between the two girls with his hands held up defensively, Miu screeching for him to move out of the death zone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her eyes watering and her throat on fire, Kaede chokes out, “Maki,” and everyone stops to look at her. “Maki is the Ultimate Assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alright, and with that chapter 2 finally comes to a close! A lot of people guessed the killer (though they did sort out most of the clues by that point, haha) but my goal for killers and victims is mostly to make the how and why interesting rather than to be shocking for the sake of it, so, hopefully this was interesting, haha. Also, though he died early, I tried to tie Korekiyo's character into the greater arc of the story, so ideally he wouldn't just end up as the unsympathetic killer with no other impact. Whether I accomplished those things is, of course, up to anyone reading!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also a quick note is that I will be taking a one week break to better plan out the nitty-gritty for chapter three, though I will still be posting something on Saturday. And as this is the end of a chapter (and I've reached the length of a short novel already), I would like to give a huge thank you to everyone who has been commenting, leaving kudos or just reading along!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s lab is exactly as Kaede imagined it ever since she received the damning video. It feels like eons have passed since then, and she tilts her head up to stare at the line of knives mounted on the wall above her—the proof of everything staring back at her unblinkingly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On the landing, facing down eleven horrified people, Maki had turned on her heel and stomped off to barricade herself in her room. Despite the bruises Kaede knows will appear bright and painful on her neck, Maki’s retreat had been a silent surrender, and as she had walked away, not one of her classmates had followed after her. It was with a bitter, spiteful triumph that Kaede thought to herself that she had everyone on her side and Maki had no one.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any feelings of victory faded at the sight of the weapon cache before her that she and her fellow classmates were all too aware any one of them could use to brutalize each other. And, like clockwork, everyone jumps backwards when Kokichi happily picks a gun off the wall to weigh in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta immediately positions himself in front of Kaede and none to subtly pushes Himiko behind him. Miu practically leaps to cover, bodily shoving herself into Kaede while Gonta raises both of his massive hands defensively. “Kokichi,” he says slowly. “Please put that down…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi blinks up at him and the semi-circle of teenagers ready to tackle him should he make too sudden a movement. “Oh? Is something wrong?” he asks innocently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quit fucking with us,” Kaito says through clenched teeth. “Put that thing the fuck down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pouts. “But it’s only a prop… and I thought it looked so cool…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With wary eyes on Kokichi, Ryoma experimentally steps forward to pick up another one of the guns. After a second of examination, he announces, “He’s actually not lying for once.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A shared sigh of relief surges through the room, and Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “You guys don’t trust me at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got that the fuck right,” Miu says, finally releasing Kaede as her makeshift shield.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “Whether we trust Kokichi or not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not,” Kaito supplies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi continues, “It isn’t really a person’s first instinct to think that a gun would be the least dangerous thing in this room. I mean, pointing a gun at someone is really traumatic…” she presses a hand to her chin, “so traumatic that if you point a gun at yourself, you could probably summon another version of yourself entirely…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to take her comment, so she says, “Well, that aside, we need to make a decision about what to do with this room. We can’t just leave all these weapons unattended.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie skips over to her. “Ooh, is Kaede thinking about confiscating everything dangerous? God thinks that’s a super great idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” she says. “But there’s always a chance Monokuma could just restock everything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So just fucking throwing out this shit is useless?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe we can assume that is correct,” Kiibo responds. “Perhaps, then, we should look into locking this room instead of disposing of its contents.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him. “Oh, that’s actually a really good idea, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He beams. “Thank you, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah, yeah!” Angie cheers. “God says that we should definitely do that…” she puts a finger to her chin. “But Angie doesn’t know where we could find a lock.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta could put something really heavy in front of the door,” he volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” says Kokichi. “If you do that, then Gonta could always come back inside.” He grins. “And then he could grab one of these hammers and smash one of us into paste! Wouldn’t that be something?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares at him. “That would never happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods quickly in agreement. “Yes, Gonta would never do something like that. Gonta is a gentleman, and gentlemen… don’t smash people into paste.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then gentlemen are boring,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ignoring all terrible boys,” Tenko says. “Attempting to move a heavy object up here would likely be incredibly difficult, even for someone with Gonta’s strength.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks to him. “We are on the third floor—that’s a lot of stairs to climb while carrying something big enough to block a door.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, hey!” says Angie. “God just told Angie exactly what we should do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hums. “Angie’s God is pretty smart…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clasps her hands. “Yup! Super, super smart! And God says that we should do what Kiibo said and just lock the door!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Yeah, but there isn’t a fucking lock. What do you want us to do? Dance around and pray to your shitty God to make one appear?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie takes a step towards Miu, something about her cheery demeanor darkening. “God says that Miu should make one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu takes a step back. “Me?! The fuck does your shitty God want with me?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo says stepping between them. “I believe that Angie is saying that you should build a lock for the room, Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks. “Oh. Oh yeah, I could fucking do that. I mean,” she examines her nails. “If I want to. The great Miu Iruma is a very busy, very important, very attractive person, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kiibo agrees. “And we would all deeply appreciate it if you would help us keep the group safe.” He turns to face only her. “We would be in your debt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins to worry a piece of her hair between her fingers. “W-w-well if you’re going to get all sappy about it, I guess I could throw something together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Well, I personally think this sounds like our best solution.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm, God says so, too,” Angie says. “And he also says to make the lock extra, extra strong and not make a key!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says before turning to the group. “Anyone have any objections?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hops up and down on the spot, waving his hand in the air. “Ooh! Ooh! Pick me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs. “Yes, Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stops bouncing and opts to tap a finger to his chin. “So, I was thinking that even if we leave barricading this room to the gross pig, what do we do about Maki?” Kaede sees stars in his eyes. “Should we lock her in here, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I agree we should do something about her, but not that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Himiko. “If we did that, then she’d starve to death…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then we’d just have another class trial,” Angie says. “Oh, but if none of us find her body, then we wouldn’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks at her, mildly horrified. “Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “Isn’t that cruel and unusual punishment?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So to put a stop to this horrible conversation,” Ryoma says. “I think everyone can agree that we’re… not going to do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says proudly coming to stand beside Kaede. “We’re not about to fucking lock Maki up anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede frowns. “I’m not sure if I can agree with that, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito jerks around to stare down at her. His voice is one of betrayal, “Kaede, what the fuck are you saying? Do you actually want to fucking imprison her somewhere or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede says quickly and a touch too loudly. The others quiet, attention focusing on her increasingly heated words. “Or—I don’t know!” she throws her hands in the air. “Even if Angie’s idea is terrible, we should still do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t actually be fucking taking this seriously,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Listen to me,” Kaede says. “I don’t think we should trap her somewhere, but we also can’t let someone as dangerous as an assassin just wander around wherever they want unsupervised!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, we don’t know if she’s dangerous,” Kaito bites back. “I mean, just because she’s killed people before doesn’t mean she’s going to do it again.” He flings an arm out to the side. “We trust fucking Ryoma, and he’s killed before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs and pulls his hat down. Very quietly he says, “Don’t drag me into this…” and Gonta puts a large hand on his shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to sniffle and mumbles, “Mommy and Daddy are fighting…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their words go ignored as Kaede immediately fires back, “Maki tried to kill me in front of everyone! Did you already forget that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “Kaito, Kaede! God says we shouldn’t fight!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she just walked away,” Kaito continues, speaking over her. “She’s probably just trying to protect herself, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Protect herself?” Kaede echoes. “Do you really think the Ultimate Assassin needs protecting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t fucking know—maybe!” he shouts. “I don’t think either of us know her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care about knowing her,” she says. “I care about stopping her from killing anyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t know that she’ll kill someone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we also don’t know that she won’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hops from foot to foot between them and raises her voice to a yell. “God really, really means it that everyone should stop fighting right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede does stop for a second, suddenly becoming pertinently aware of each and every nervous stare focused on her. Kaito stops, too, sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck and staring at somewhere that’s not her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes the opportunity to clear her throat and address the group. “Alright. That’s right. We’ll,” she makes eye contact with Kaito for a brief moment, “we’ll talk about this later. We’ll calmly talk about this later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito huffs and crosses his arms but does not say another word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie breaks the threatening silence. “Okay, so, so, so, now that everyone’s getting along again, God is wondering what we should do now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have a suggestion!” says a certain robotic voice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pops up from seemingly nowhere, automatically earning the group’s undivided attention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi points an unsteady finger at him. “Y-you again! Are you here to give us another motive or something horrible?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves his paw. “Nope! Not this time! It’s way too early in our extra spooky plot arc for our extra spooky motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m talking about your extra spooky exploration!” he says. “Now where are my adorable children?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his cue, the three remaining bears appear. The pink and red ones huddle together, putting noticeable distance between themselves and the overtly robotic one who proceeds to take the lead. In a monotone voice, “WE-ARE-HERE.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh good, good,” Monokuma says. “Now, we can present the special exploration items for this time around. You should really thank your classmates for their noble sacrifices—especially since they bring super cool rewards!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grits her teeth at his words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says, “Does that mean more of the school’s going to open now?” She pouts. “I still haven’t eaten yet today, and now we have to walk all around again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, it’s okay, Himiko,” says Tenko. “We can definitely take a break to eat before exploring. It is important to stay energized after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is Himiko ever energetic?” Tsumugi wonders idly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Monokuma tuts. “It’s time for my adorable children to show off our special items!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam’s motionless face seems to darken. “YOU-KEEP-ORDERING-US-AROUND, FATHER. AND-YOUR-ORDERS-ARE-STOPPING-US-ALL-FROM-BECOMING-FRIENDS.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma tilts his furry head. “Oh? Are you speaking back to your father?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The robot seems to glower. It mutters, “SOON,” in the same stilted voice before waddling over to Angie and lifting its paws up to display three odd items. “YOU-ARE-MAKING-SURE-EVERYONE-GETS-ALONG. HAVE-THESE.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, thank you so much!” Angie says taking them easily. “Angie and God will do their best!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam nods. It turns, sending one more ominous stare to Monokuma before vanishing as quickly as it came. The remaining two exchange a worried look before following suit, leaving Monokuma behind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, kids,” he sighs. “One day you’ll all learn what it’s like to be a parent. If you live long enough, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And he vanishes again as Angie takes center stage. “Okay, okay—Angie got some really cool stuff,” she says, shuffling the objects in her hands. “Which means we can do some super fun exploring!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I see. Should we split up to quickly cover ground like last time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mmm,” Angie hums. “Nope! God says that’s a bad idea since that’s how Kirumi and Korekiyo managed to fight with no one noticing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… right, isn’t it?” says Kaede with a sigh. “We need everyone to share information if we want to prevent another killing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi asks, tilting his head to the side. “It sounds like you don’t trust us, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Miu’s the one to come to her defense, loudly snorting and flipping her hair over her shoulder. “Well, fucking duh. People keeping secrets leads to bullshit. And also,” she jabs a finger into his skinny chest, “didn’t you say like twenty goddamn minutes ago that you were going to start fucking with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He blinks his round eyes at her blankly. “Was that me? You must be mistaking me for someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu lets out something akin to a growl before Angie interrupts. “Okay—so, if you guys remember, God just said we shouldn’t fight, sooo,” she moves to stand between. “God thinks you two should hug and make up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eww!” Kokichi says, beginning to sniffle. “I don’t want to touch Miu! I’ll get all dirty!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, what the fuck is that supposed to mean, you little cocksucking—!” Miu shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clears her throat. “So, Miu, Kokichi, God is waiting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he’s going to be waiting a long goddamn time,” Miu says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Angie’s smile does not falter, something about it becomes distinctly unnerving.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cowers. “M-m-maybe we could just fucking shake hands?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And her cheer returns. “Okay! God thought it over and says that works, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puts on the most childishly disgusted face he can as the two shake hands, Angie overseeing them like a disapproving parent. Tenko takes the opportunity to approach behind her. “Ahem, Angie, perhaps now would be a good time for us to break for lunch before exploring? Himiko is still hungry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, okay!” she says, turning to face Tenko and missing the way Kokichi immediately yanks his hand out of her grip to begin wiping it on the empty sleeve of Kaito’s coat, unbeknownst to its owner.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie moves to head out of the room. “Everyone follow Angie! Since Kirumi’s not here anymore, God says everyone needs to work together to make lunch!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to stand just outside the door, watching the others exchange mildly dubious looks before following after her. Kaito begins to move with the crowd when Kaede says, “Hey—maybe now would be a good time to have that talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He turns to her with a sigh. “Yeah, you’re probably right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances out the door and nods to Angie still waiting on the other side. “Angie, we’ll be just a minute, okay? We’ll catch up with everyone later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie seems to hesitate for a moment before shuffling the three strange objects under one arm to wave goodbye to them with her other. “Okay! But Angie will come to get you if you take too long!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends her a nod in acknowledgment, and Angie skips away. Alone in the room, Kaede and Kaito stare at each other, quietly waiting for the sounds of Angie’s bouncing steps to fade completely. When they do, Kaito says, “Alright. I’m not the kind of guy who apologizes for no reason, but I shouldn’t have picked a fight with you earlier. Not with everyone else around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods grimly. “It… certainly did not make us look great in front of everyone, no.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No kidding,” he snorts. “And looks like Angie’s taking charge now, for better or worse.” He shakes his head. “Can’t believe everyone’s taking orders from fucking Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t worry about that too much,” Kaede says. “Most of the others just kind of do whatever they want, no matter who’s in charge. And also,” she looks him straight in the eye, “we’re not skipping lunch to talk about Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, guess not,” Kaito says, running a hand through his hair. “We should probably just… start fucking talking or something, yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is the plan,” Kaede says. “And I’ll start.” She squares her shoulders. “First thing’s first, and that’s that I don’t trust Maki, and I have no idea why you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “You really don’t fucking pull your punches, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I don’t,” she says, crossing her arms. “Now will you tell me why you’re so insistent on taking Maki’s side over mine?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not taking sides,” Kaito says. “There are no sides besides us against Monokuma.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, fine,” Kaede concedes. “But just because Maki’s not our main enemy, doesn’t mean she’s our friend. I mean, look around this place—if she knows how to use even half of these weapons, then she is far too dangerous for us to just brush off as nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “And I keep saying that just because someone fucking knows how to use a weapon doesn’t mean they will. And just because someone’s killed before doesn’t mean they’ll fucking do it again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “That is an awful lot of faith to just blindly put in someone, especially considering our situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their conversation lulls, Kaito furrowing his brow and thinking hard. In the pause, Kaede feels the heat of her own face and body fueled by her unyielding anger alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives her an odd look and finally says, “Is that why you think she’s going to kill someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “It is,” and her words echo through the arsenal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bullshit,” he says. “Like I said before—you trust Ryoma and he’s killed people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma’s different,” says Kaede. “And comparing the two is like apples and oranges. They’re obviously completely different people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” he says slowly. “But here’s the thing I’m having a lot of fucking trouble buying—it’s not just Ryoma, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He ticks off his fingers. “Shuichi, Kirumi, Korekiyo—they all fucking tried to kill someone and you fought fucking tooth and nail for them. Hell, whenever anyone even thinks about talking shit about them, you get angry. Face it,” he says staring down at her, “you’re fucking treating Maki differently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And the red swimming in her vision blocks out his logic. Kaede clenches her jaw. “That’s because it <i>is</i> different when someone personally threatens you. Until you have someone actually try to strangle you, I don’t think I’m going to listen to your opinion about Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Fucking hell. Why are you being so goddamn stubborn about this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what if I am being stubborn?” Kaede asks, anger beginning to rise over her. “Even if I’m biased, it doesn’t mean I’m wrong. An assassin is an assassin. You can’t just ignore that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she’s also a fucking person!” Kaito shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s a ticking time bomb waiting to actually kill the first person who makes her angry,” says Kaede, dropping her voice to a hiss. “She’s not a sob story, she’s not our friend, and she’s not Kirumi, Korekiyo, or Shuichi. She’s Maki, and she’s a monster.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “You’re not fucking changing your mind on this, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I’m not,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” he throws his hands in the air. “Then I’ll watch her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’ll what?” Kaede snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said she needs supervision, so I’m fucking volunteering!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to shout at him when the sound of someone rapping their knuckles against the door causes both of them to whip around. Angie stands framed before them, bearing the same dark smile she wore just moments ago. “So Angie’s back now,” she says. “And she heard a lot of yelling on the way here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hello, Angie,” Kaede says, finding her emotional high suddenly deflating all at once. “Sorry. We were just talking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Yeah, but Angie doesn’t think normal talking usually gets that loud.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re both real fucking passionate,” Kaito supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kaede agrees, not looking him in the eyes. “And we’re just talking things out. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head one way and then the other. “Sooo, God isn’t sure about that, but Angie came to get you guys, which means you should stop yelling and come with Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll be just one more minute, Angie,” says Kaede. “I just need…” she takes a breath, “I just need to remind Kaito that, our personal feelings aside, the safety of everyone in the group comes first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yeah, and I need to remind Kaede that Maki’s part of the group, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, but, like, you guys should do that while we eat because Angie really wants to start exploring the school soon,” she says. “God’s getting really impatient, too, and it’s super, super important not to keep God waiting!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s head snaps to her. “Actually, Angie, you’re right. We are done here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito raise his eyebrows. “We are?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, we are,” Kaede echoes. “We’ve simply decided to agree to disagree, and I’m sure Kaito will appreciate his new assignment of watching over Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, is that the plan for what to do with Maki?” Angie asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Apparently,” Kaito says slowly, eyes still trained on Kaede. “Which means… we are fucking done here, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands. “Then let’s go eat! Everyone tried their hardest so it has to be super good!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She skips ahead, and trailing a few feet behind her, Kaito mutters out of the corner of his mouth to Kaede, “So you’re just giving in? Did you hit your head when I wasn’t looking or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “No. I’m just giving you everything you wanted. You should be happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s not fucking giving in because…?” he prompts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I know you’ll see how bad an idea it is,” Kaede says. “And because I know that since you’re as stubborn as me, letting you try is the only thing that will convince you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk in silence for a few moments before Kaito finally says, “So if I fuck up and Maki attacks someone, you win?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No, if that happens, I’m right. If you succeed in somehow convincing her to stop being a bloodthirsty assassin, then I win.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He snorts. “Either way, everything’ll fucking coming up Kaede. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As long as everything works out,” she says staring straight ahead. “That’s the plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Arriving to their lunch of noticeably mediocre food, Kaito immediately looks around and asks for an extra plate of food to bring to Maki. Kaede barely resists rolling her eyes, even as Kaito insists that the other girl is likely as hungry as they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie merrily shuffles something together for him, and he leaves with a noticeably weak nod to Kaede. She does roll her eyes when the cafeteria doors swing shut behind him before taking a seat between Tenko and Miu, the former cooing over Himiko’s eating and the latter describing the flavors in near grotesque detail to Kiibo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, while Kiibo seems appreciative, Himiko instead huffs and bodily shifts away from Tenko. “Stop saying that,” she mumbles. “I’m not a cute animal… I’m just tryin’ to eat…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko freezes. “Ah! Tenko is sorry. She just meant—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just eat, okay?” Himiko says. “I don’t wanna talk about being cute and helpless or anything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko understands,” she says quickly. “And Tenko is sorry again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over to them. “Is everything alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s head snaps to her. “Everything is fine, Kaede. Himiko is just a bit grouchy since she hasn’t eaten yet today. That’s all. Also,” she frowns. “Are you and Kaito fighting? Does Tenko need to flip him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Well—no to the flipping. He’s still hurt, whether he’ll admit it or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Since Kirumi… isn’t here anymore, Tenko can check on his injury,” she says. “Also Tenko thinks that Kaito should probably sit out of exploring then, even though we said everyone should go. Standing for hours at the trial was probably not good for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And running around the school would probably just make things worse, yeah,” Kaede adds. “I doubt he’ll listen to me right now, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you guys talking about?” Himiko says, leaning towards them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko quickly waves her hands. “Ah, nothing you need to worry about, Himiko. Tenko has it under control.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pouts. “But I wanna know… do I need to use my magic to find out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is no need for that, Himiko. We were just,” Tenko shoots a glance to Kaede for confirmation. “Talking about Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Himiko says. “Why are you talking about him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sends Kaede another wary look, prompting her to sigh before answering. “I suppose there’s no reason to keep it a secret,” she says. “Kaito and I just had a disagreement about Maki, and,” she tugs at the brim of her hat, “and it ended with him volunteering to supervise her, even though he’s hurt and she’s dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But there is no need for you to worry about Maki, Himiko,” Tenko says. “Tenko will always protect you and Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one’s trying to hurt me, though,” Himiko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Tenko knows that,” she says. “But Tenko is still always ready to use her Neo-Aikido whenever Himiko needs any help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko doesn’t say another word, simply staring at her blankly before returning to her eating.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko beings to sweat and after anxiously staring at her for a few moments, turns to Kaede to loudly whisper, “Kaede, did Tenko do something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances around her to watch Himiko for a second. “I don’t think so…” she whispers back. “Everyone’s probably just a little on edge because of this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “That makes sense… maybe Tenko should still apologize to Himiko again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede about to respond when Angie stands from her spot next to Gonta and Ryoma to clap her hands. “Hey, hey everyone! Angie has something to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo!” Miu shouts. “Sit down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie ignores her. “So Angie was thinking, and God told her the absolute perfect solution for what to do with all the motive videos we have left.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s glare has been trained on her since the moment she stood, but now his eyes narrow dangerously. “And that would be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We take all the videos,” she begins, “and we throw them in Maki’s lab! That way when Miu locks the door, nobody can see them again, and then nobody will want to leave the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu leans back in her chair. “Eh, I guess if you idiots manage to take care of it before I slap a lock on that bitch, sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Awesome!” Angie says. “So we all agree then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Ryoma. “We don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Yeah, but see the thing is God told Angie that we should do it, so that’s what’s going to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t have to do anything because your God says so,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Angie says leaning down to stare at him. “Do you still want to leave the school?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t back down an inch. “Everyone,” he says. “Wants to leave this hell school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but see, Angie doesn’t!” she says. “And Angie thinks that people wanting to leave the school is our problem—so God says we need to do everything we can to stop people from wanting to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie,” Kaede says, standing as well. “Think about what you’re saying. Getting rid of motives to make us kill each other is a very different thing from stopping everyone from trying to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kiibo says. “I have no problem disposing of potential motives, but abandoning any hope of leaving is undeniably a bad thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, what Kiibs said!” Miu shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Thank you, Miu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Kokichi says. “What Kiiboy said!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo falters. “Uh, thank you as well, Kokichi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well it looks like everyone agrees then!” Angie says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that’s what just happened,” Tsumugi quietly interjects.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So after we’re done exploring,” Angie continues. “Angie will collect everyone’s motive videos, and we can just lock them away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Out of sight out of mind…” Himiko mumbles. “That sounds like a pretty good idea…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Ryoma. “It doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie sighs. “Look, Ryoma, even if you don’t agree, God really says we should soooo, that’s what Angie’s going to do. Okay?” She clasps her hands. “Everyone’s happy then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">An uncomfortable silence greets her, but Angie pays it no mind as she hops back down in her chair to continue eating, not a care directed to Ryoma’s barely concealed fury.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Lunch continues on awkwardly, and eventually Kaito limps back into the room, quickly moving to sit across from Kaede with only a nod in acknowledgement. Kaede opts to leave it at that for the moment and makes conversation with Tenko, punctuated by Himiko’s occasional comment. When Angie finishes eating, she stands to move to the center of the room again. Kaede and Tenko look up at her. Kaito continues to quietly shovel food into his mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” she begins. “So Angie was looking over the items we got and there’s a funny scroll thingie, a funny hammer, and an even funnier key!” She extends the hammer towards Gonta. “God says Gonta should take the hammer since he’s really strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta accepts it but looks up at her quizzically. “Thank you, Angie, but Gonta thought everyone was sticking together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, we are!” she says. “But like not everyone together-together. God told Angie we should check around outside first and let Miu start making the lock for Maki’s lab while everyone else explores.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, why the fuck am I the only one being left out!?” Miu asks leaping to her feet and slamming her hands down on the table.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta still doesn’t know why he got a hammer…” Gonta mumbles to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, if we’re only missing one person when we explore, God says it will be totally okay!” Angie says. “And Gonta got a hammer so he can hammer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks down at the small object in his hands, absolutely baffled.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs and gently takes it from him. “Don’t worry—I’ll help you figure out what to do with it. We’re supposed to figure out this puzzle together anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta smiles down at him as Kiibo assures Miu, “Do not worry, Miu, I can fill you in on everything that happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu turns to him, face flushed pink. “You’ll fill me in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, everyone’s getting along now!” Angie says. “See what happens when everyone listens to Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay!” says Kokichi jumping to his feet. “That’s enough waiting around—let’s go explore!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hurries out of the room, Angie following after him, shouting, “Kokichi! Wait for everyone! God says we all need to go together!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta stands. “Uh, wait! Gonta still has the hammer!” and he, too, begins to speed walk after them, Ryoma at his side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry about it,” Ryoma assures him as they exit. “They’ll figure out it’s missing soon enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes the opportunity to rise from her chair. Addressing the remaining students, she says, “Well, we should head after them. Everyone ready?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko energetically shouts, “Tenko is ready!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko drawls, “But I was still eating…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can fucking shove your face later,” Miu says, walking over to Kaede. “If you put on more fat, maybe then you’ll actually get some tits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to reprimand her, when Miu leans closer to her ear, and whispers in an actually quiet voice for once, “Oi, Bakamatsu, try and see if you can fucking sneak away from the orgy for a sec, and come to my lab. There’s some shit I need to tell you about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow and says in a matching hushed tone, “Is it about the thing we found in the bathroom?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrugs. “Dunno. Kinda. But I need your advice about something, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Alright, I’ll see what I can do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rises as well, and says, “You two wanna tell us what you’re whispering about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tsumugi nods, walking over as well. “Angie has been saying we shouldn’t keep secrets from each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, um,” Kaede looks around the room quickly for inspiration. “Miu was just asking me…” she spies Kiibo approaching, “about getting a present for Kiibo. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “Miu wants to get me a present?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Miu pulls a face before Kaede quickly elbows her in the stomach. “I mean—yeah,” she grumbles. “We’re... throwing you a surprise party or something, I don't fucking know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but,” Tsumugi says. “It’s not much of a surprise now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No because all you ugly, nosy virgins ruined it!” Miu shouts, throwing her hands in the air. She begins to storm off. “Whatever, I’ll be in my fucking lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo immediately runs after her, calling, “Wait, Miu! Why are you throwing a party for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaito says. “I’m going to fucking go out on a limb here and assume there’s no surprise party for Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Well, there is now. Come on everyone,” she begins to walk towards the door. “We can talk on the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They exit the cafeteria, and Kaede lets herself fall to the back with a slightly limping Kaito. Tenko and Tsumugi quickly get into a conversation about idols and clothing, Himiko moving along silently at Tenko’s side. The two girls’ voices are just loud enough for Kaede to comfortably talk under them once they exit the school and leave the echoing halls behind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still looking forward at the backs of the three girls, she says in a measured tone, “So, how did it go with Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They continue in silence for another moment before Kaito responds, “Well, she asked me if I wanted to be killed, so pretty good so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives him a wry smile. “So are we counting giving her lunch and leaving alive as a win?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “Well just because round one didn’t go so great doesn’t mean I’m giving up.” He grins down at her. “I am the great Kaito Momota, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do think it’s come up a few times,” she laughs before shaking her head. “It’s weird. I still feel I’m right, but I also feel like I should apologize.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Yeah, I get that feeling sometimes. So usually I just keep my mouth shut.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think it’s called having too much pride,” Kaede suggests.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You might be right,” he says. “Also you should probably know I still think you’re wrong about her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m sure you do,” Kaede says. “Even if all she did was threaten you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Well, that’s not really how it went. I think she was mostly just fucking surprised anyone would come to see her at all.” He shrugs. “Sometimes people fucking lash out when they don’t know what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that still doesn’t mean it’s okay or that you should put yourself at risk,” she says. “Especially since you’re still hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “I am not hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then from ahead of them, Tenko calls out, “Yes, you are!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Eavesdropping on us, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko was not eavesdropping,” she insists, falling back to walk alongside them. “But she did notice the way you’re attempting to hide a limp.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am not,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but you really are,” Tsumugi adds, falling in step with them as well as they descend the outside stairs. “I can always tell when a cosplayer is having trouble walking in their outfit at a convention, so examining people’s walking patterns is kind of a sixth sense for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, you’re senses are going fucking haywire because I’m fine,” he says before sweeping an arm out to gesture to the small group standing in front of an odd statue. “And we’re fucking here, so you can all get off my back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko chooses to tune into the conversation. “Oh, is someone offering piggyback rides?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can give you one, Himiko,” she says quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we’re almost there,” says Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sure enough, Angie spies them and immediately begins waving her arms, beckoning them closer. Kaede straightens her shoulders and leads her group to meet Angie’s, the girl in question immediately talking as they approach. She says, “Oh, yay! Everyone finally made it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Kiibo. “With the exception of Miu, who I escorted to her lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s right,” says Angie. “Oh, and Kaede, Kiibo was just telling Angie that you and Miu were planning a surprise party for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces. “It seems… things have certainly panned out that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Angie just thinks that is the best idea, and God says that Angie should help, too!” she says. “Ooh, we can throw a party for Kiibo <i>and</i> have Himiko put on a magic show, and that way everybody will be having so much fun, nobody will want to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta raises his hand. “If it’s not too impolite for Gonta to ask, why is there a surprise party for Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kokichi. “I thought nobody liked the useless robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well, obviously you are wrong!” Kiibo says, too fed up to think clearly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but anyway,” Angie says. “God says we should plan that later and put this weird scroll thingie in this weird statue thingie first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to do just that, and as soon as it clicks into place, a large building begins to form itself before their very eyes in a matter of seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is the first to react, immediately pointing and shrieking with delight, “It’s a dojo!” and rushing forward to swing the doors open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others follow after her, entering inside the large room before seeing Tenko standing firmly in front of them with one hand held out in front of her. “Tenko says shoes off before stepping on the mat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede immediately looks down at the floor, noticing the large training area before moving to remove her shoes. Angie slips off her sandals the quickest and begins bouncing around the room, while the already barefoot Gonta moves forward to begin examining the large moving statue in the back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo—also already barefoot in his own way—tentatively steps on to the mat, testing the waters for Tenko’s ire at the action. She looks at him and grunts noncommittally, prompting him to keep moving. He idly wanders around, saying, “So this is Tenko’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes!” says Tenko. “Ah! Tenko is so excited!” She drops into a battle pose. “Quick, who wants to spar with Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Finally stepping on to the mat and towards Tenko in her socks, Kaede says, “I’m not really sure if anyone here should—whoa!!!” and suddenly finds herself being flipped upside-down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She lands on the mat in heap. “Ow, Tenko,” Kaede says sitting up and rubbing her suddenly sore arm. “What was that for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s jumping around excitedly. “Ooh! Ooh! Do Kiiboy next!” Kiibo immediately moves as far away from Tenko as possible, though does not verbally rise to Kokichi’s baiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko ignores him and looks down at Kaede with a sympathetic expression. “Kaede,” she says softly. “Tenko can always tell when her opponent’s heart is in turmoil.” Tenko reaches a hand forward to help her up, which Kaede takes. “You can always talk to Tenko, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” says Kaede, fiddling to adjust Shuichi’s hat back into place. “I know, I’ve just,” she takes a breath. “Things have been busy lately...”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Kaede can still come talk to Tenko anytime.” She shakes her head and lowers her voice so only Kaede can hear, “No one should carry that much guilt around by themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows. “I know.” She gives Tenko her best smile. “But a leader has to out on a brave face sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “We already talked about—oh, Himiko,” she says, and Kaede looks down to see Himiko suddenly standing right at Tenko’s side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says, “You guys sure whisper a lot.” She places a finger on her lip. “Maybe I should cast a hearing spell or something on myself…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, there’s no need for that,” says Tenko. “Oh, but, Himiko, would you like to spar with Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She juts out her lip. “I don’t really—ahhhh!!!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede barely stifles a laugh as Tenko suddenly flips Himiko to the ground in the same way she did to her only moments earlier.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Laying flat on her back, Himiko mumbles, “Whyyyyy…” before Tenko leans down to extend a hand to help her back to her feet. Himiko regards it warily before taking it and pulling herself back up. Brushing her skirt off, she says, “Ugh… my waist hurts…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods at her. “Tenko is sorry, but, Himiko,” she says gently. “You shouldn’t be afraid or embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Afraid or embarrassed about what?” Himiko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Showing emotions,” says Tenko. “Or being included. Or useful.” She smiles down at her. “Himiko just needs to be herself, even if it’s hard, and everyone will love her. Tenko knows because Himiko has a beautiful heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A slight blush creeps across Himiko’s face and she pulls her hat down before muttering, “Yeah, uh, thanks…” and scurrying away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko watches her leave and asks for the second time that day, “Did Tenko say something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “I think she’s just a bit embarrassed at being complemented by a cute girl.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s face suddenly erupts into an even brighter blush. “A-Ah! Saying things like that to Tenko all of a sudden…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kaito approaches, bouncing slightly on the mat. “Wow, you’re pretty cool, Tenko,” he says. “You can just, like, fucking read people’s minds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then her blush turns to a frown. “It’s not that simple. Tenko can just sense people’s emotions when she is in the heat of battle with them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eh,” he waves his hand. “Same difference. Oh, you know who you should fucking totally do next?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins at her before cupping a hand around his mouth, “Hey, Kokichi! Come over here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko curls up her lip in disgust. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The smaller boy skips over to them. “Oh? Is my beloved Kaito calling for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “Hey, Tenko, do your thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he tilts his head. “What thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rolls her eyes and looks to Kaede. “Does Tenko have to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shrugs. “I don’t know. It could be fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko lets out an aggravated sigh. “Fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s pouting saying, “Are you guys keeping a secret from me because—ahhhhh!!!” before Tenko suddenly lifts him off his feet and throws him back down on to the mat in the same motion as before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Unlike Kaede and Himiko, he sits up immediately, pointing an accusing finger at Tenko. “Hey! That was a dirty trick!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “You fucking saw her do it before. You even volunteered Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Instead of listening, he begins to sniffle, tears welling up in his eyes. “Everyone picks on me all the time, and now I’m getting beat up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, stop crying,” says Kaito. “It can’t fucking hurt that much since Kaede and Himiko aren’t complaining.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks up to him, lip trembling. “But my bones are made of glass, and my skin’s made of paper.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes, finally reaching a hand down to him. “You’re a delicate fucking flower. I get—hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with a hard yank on his arm, Kokichi pulls Kaito to the floor as he jumps up, giggling at the taller boy’s yelping. Kaito’s back on his feet in an instant, awkwardly chasing after him and waving one fist in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks on vaguely amused before spying Tenko’s expression of confusion. “Tenko?” she asks. “Is everything alright? You went quiet all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head—shaking herself out of thoughts about something Kaede can only guess at—before turning back to her. “Oh, um, Tenko’s fine. She was just thinking about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to talk about it?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says quickly. “Tenko means—Tenko still needs to think a little.” She shakes her head again. “Actually never mind, it’s nothing. Tenko just… got a little confused.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede regards her carefully, but says, “Okay, if you’re sure.” Then she glances around the room, particularly at Kokichi and Kaito’s chase that seems to be consuming all of her classmates’ attention. “Also, would you mind maybe distracting everyone for a little while?” Kaede asks. “I need to go talk to Miu, and I don’t want anyone to miss me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can do that,” she says. “But why is talking with Miu something you want to keep secret?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, no reason,” says Kaede, already moving to slip her shoes back on. “But, uh, if anyone does ask where I am, just tell them that I’ll meet them all at the top of the outside staircase to keep exploring with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says. “Tenko will try… but is something wrong, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up at her and almost all of her classmates happily entertaining themselves like the big group of friends she always wanted them to be. And that very thought becomes almost too painful to bare when she thinks about the reason for why she has to sneak around. She finishes slipping on her shoes and lies that, “No. Everything’s fine,” before waving a still hesitant Tenko goodbye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raps her knuckles against the door to Miu’s lab, softly calling, “Hey, Miu, it’s me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Through the door, she hears the distinct sounds of metal crashing against metal, followed by a serious of curses before the door cracks opens to reveal one of Miu’s eyes. She says, “You alone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door is pushed open a few inches wider, and Miu’s arms darts through the opening to drag Kaede inside through the uncomfortably tight gap. Kaede quickly gathers herself on inside Miu’s lab while the other girl slams the door shut and takes to clicking an intricate series of locks shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches her, and says, “Has your lab always had so many locks?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still focusing on her current task, Miu says, “Nah. There were a few at first, then they fucking disappeared then I decided to put a fuck ton back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” she asks. “Are you worried about someone stealing something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head and finally turns back to Kaede, brushing her hands off. “Nah, I’ve just been working on a few fucking top secret projects, which,” she walks past Kaede to her work table, “I’m about to show you, so hold on to your tits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces but follows her. Miu shuffles around with a few things stacked under the table before presenting a strange hammer like object and two circular objects that unnervingly remind Kaede of grenades. She lowers her head to get a closer look at the inventions and says, “is it alright if I touch these? They look… not safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “You can fucking shove one up your ass, and you’ll be fine. These babies will only hurt if you’re made of metal and circuits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ignoring her specific choice of words, Kaede gingerly weighs one of the grenades in her hands. “So,” she says, thinking over Miu’s warning. “It shuts down machines?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says picking up the other. “It’s an EMP bomb. The hammer’ll do the same thing if you ram it in something’s ass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay?” Kaede says. “So... I think I have three questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shoot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“First,” she says. “Why do you have these? Second: why are they secret? And third, why did you want my opinion?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu places the EMP grenade back on the table, rolling it around absently in thought as she debates how to phrase her next statement. “So, answering second question first, these are secret since I think the mastermind would smash them to pieces and then shove them down my fucking throat if they found out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s head snaps up to look at her. “Wait, could these be used to shut down some of the school’s defense systems? Like the Exisals?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Miu says. “Throw one of these suckers at ‘em and goodnight to the teddy bears and their fucking mechs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says. “And that’s why you made them, right? To fight back against Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wrong,” says Miu. “I made them because someone asked me to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can physically feel the tension in the room rise. She puts down the EMP grenade she had been fiddling with. “Who?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi fucking Kokichi,” she says. “Few days ago, the little twink came down here and whined at me until I agreed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just blinks at her comment. “Kokichi… wanted these…” She furrows her brow. “Did he say what for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” Miu answers. “For all his fucking crying, the brat got real goddamn cagey the second I actually tried asking him anything. Then he ran off and told me to have them done by today. Which brings me to your third question,” she leans forward on the table. “Do I actually give this shit to him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That <i>is</i> a good question,” Kaede says. “But, Miu, why are you asking me this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because,” she says leaning even farther towards Kaede and jabbing a finger at her chest. “You’re one of the few people in this shit hole I trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And for some reason, that’s the statement that catches Kaede off guard the most. “You trust me?” she echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi, don’t fucking say it like that, Bakamatsu,” Miu huffs. “It’s not a sappy besties thing, it’s a ‘I know you’re not the goddamn mastermind’ thing. And,” she returns to pointing her finger at Kaede, “After seeing shit shows one and two with Shyhara and Shitguji, I’m pretty damn sure you’d never even fucking think about killing anyone in a million years.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fidgets uncomfortably with the brim of Shuichi’s hat, but manages to say, “I do… suppose that is true. But, um, Miu,” Kaede almost pleads, “I can’t be the only person you trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu tilts her head, thinking for a moment before saying, “Well, Kiibo’s pretty good, I guess. Oh yeah! That’s right,” she picks one of the grenades up again. “So since goddamn Kokichi asked me to make this shit a while back, I safeguarded Kiibo against them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her. “How did you do that? Do they just not work on him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, they’ll fuck his shit,” she says. “But during his last maintenance—you know when Kirumi poured crap all over him?—the great archangel Miu Iruma had the foresight to set up a back up system, which means if his brain gets fried ‘cause Kokichi’s a fuck, we can save his brain and download him into something else.” She frowns. “I mean, rest of his circuits will be fucked to hell and back, but his A.I. will save itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, mulling her words over. “I think I get it… but,” she bites her lip. “Do you think Kokichi asked for this stuff just to mess with Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hell if I know,” Miu answers. “I mean, I wouldn’t put it past the little brat, but, then again, that’s why I’m calling you in for a second opinion.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede answers. “Also, speaking of Kiibo, we might be throwing a party for him now since he may have told everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, fuck me,” Miu says. “I was just gonna slap some flashlight eyes that I was fucking making anyway on him and call it good.” She sighs, pushing her hair over her should. “Oh, well, I guess there’s worse shitty people to have to make crap for. Like fucking everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches her quietly before saying, “I don’t think a party’s the worst idea, you know--even if we had to come up with it on the spot. I think that maybe since it’s for Kiibo, we could do a memorial for everyone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu falls silent for a moment before muttering, “Guess he did like Kirumi a lot…” her spirits return as she lets out an undignified snort, “and you’re still fucking pining after Shyhara, so yeah, whatever—guess nobody’ll fucking think twice if we do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, right,” Kaede says, wincing at Miu’s justification. “But, um, a-anyway, are you,” she gestures to the objects still lying on the table, “um, going to give these to Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shakes her head. “Dunno. Like, it could completely fuck us if I did.” She leans even closer, whispering conspiratorially despite being alone. “Like, you think he’s the mastermind or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No…” Kaede says slowly, stepping back from the table. “If anything… isn’t this stuff all proof that he’s not? I mean, if these things shut down part of the security system, I think the mastermind would want it destroyed immediately. Asking for them to be made is out of the question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Makes sense…” Miu frowns but nods. “So… that means on the mastermind countdown, it’s not me, you, or fucking Kokichi,” she says. “And we can count out all the dead assholes, so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms and begins to walk towards the door, Miu following after her. “I’d also hazard a guess that the mastermind is probably a girl since we, well, found the passageway through the girls’ bathroom.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, but fucking girl or boy,” Miu says, “they’d still need it to be empty as shit before they wander into a supply closet for no damn reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods again. “That is true… which means that it could still be almost anyone. Or at least, we can't automatically eliminate anyone as a suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And, Bakamatsu,” Miu says, moving to the door and beginning to undo the series of locks, “we can only fucking trust each other, you got that? This shit stays locked the hell down between us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” says Kaede to her back. “And you should probably also give Kokichi the stuff you made then—to not raise his suspicions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She groans. “Ugh, fine,” and she finishes undoing the last lock. “You know I <i>really</i> hate that pasty little twink, though—fucking hell!” Miu physically jumps backwards as through the same tiny crack in the door she had opened previously for Kaede, an eye peers in from the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Giggling erupts from outside, and Kaede moves to push the door open to see Kokichi grinning up at her. “Kokichi?” she asks, trying to hide her panic. “Uh, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sneaking away like you,” he answers. “Tenko’s lab is pretty boring, so I figured I’d come follow you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu pulls Kaede back to frame herself in the door and thrusts a finger at him. “Were you just fucking standing out there waiting to scare the shit out of me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “I’d never do a thing like that. Do you know how rude it is to scare people?” He hums. “Actually you probably do, since you’re already pretty scary.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can hear Miu grinding her teeth together. “Listen here, you little shitstain—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, that’s enough!” Kaede says, pushing past Miu to stand between them. She clears her throat. “I was just checking to see if Miu finished building a lock for Maki’s lab so she could come with us for the rest of the exploration.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu looks at her quizzically for a few moments before dully saying, “Yeah. It’s almost fucking done. Just been busy with,” she waves her hand vaguely as if to summon an idea, “Kiibo’s fucking surprise party or some shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi regards them for a moment before sighing. “Hmm, one day I hope you two learn how to lie,” he says nonchalantly. “Otherwise playing this game with you is going to be one boredom after another.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is that supposed to mean?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs, saying “Nothing, nothing!” before pulling on one of her hands with both of his. “Now, c’mon, Kaede! Everyone’s waiting for us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his meager strength, Kaede mostly lets herself be dragged along by Kokichi, sending one last glance and a wave to Miu, standing alone in her lab and with their shared secret.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alright, and I'm back to start chapter three! Thanks to everyone for being patient with this update and to anyone who did decide to check out the oneshot I did end up posting since I kind of consider that to be my master piece, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls her hand out of Kokichi’s grip as they stumble away from Miu’s lab. He turns on his heel to face her and immediately starts pouting. “Aw, do you not want to hold hands, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She ignores him to issue her own accusations. “What were you doing outside of Miu’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “I already told you—I was looking for you after you snuck away from Tenko’s Aikido party.” His smile stretches too far for his face. “It was rather rude of you to just wander off without telling anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a step towards him. “I’m asking the questions here—were you trying to listen in on us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head. “Why would I do? Were you talking about something secret?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says and walks past him back towards Tenko’s lab. “We weren’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that so?” he says following after her. “Because I think I heard you guys talking about things that Miu said you weren’t going to tell anyone else.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips around to face him when he starts to laugh. “That was a lie of course, though.” Kaede clenches her fists but doesn’t respond. Kokichi just keeps smiling. “Geeze, why are you so angry, Kaede? Have a guilty conscience?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she answers again, narrowing her eyes. “I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, that sure is strange,” Kokichi says. “I mean, if I was you, I sure would have one. Or maybe you’re just getting to be a better liar already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede practically hisses out, “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins up at her, and the doors to Tenko’s lab burst open. He lowers his voice and says, “Maybe next time, Kaede,” and the sound of Kaito shouting in the distance brings any attempt at an interrogation to an end.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns towards the sudden explosion of noise to see Kaito point a finger at Kokichi and stopping over, yelling all the way while the others follow behind him. “There you are, you fucking brat!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, hi, Kaito!” he says, childlike cheer returning to his voice. “Were you looking for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking quit the crap,” Kaito says. He reaches them and leans down to glare at Kokichi’s beaming face. “I knew you’d fucking cut and run the second I had my back turned.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between them and says, “What’s happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito’s threatening to beat me up for no reason,” Kokichi says nonchalantly. “Seems like he’s having a pretty good time, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s face begins to turn red as Tenko hurries over to them, pulling Kaito backwards to physically place herself between the two boys. “What’s happening is that all awful boys are going to calm down right now, or they will have to answer to Tenko’s Neo-Aikido.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup,” says Angie, skipping over. “God still says no fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives her a way look, but says, “Tenko has to agree. Especially for Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What!?” he whips his head towards her. “Why me? He’s the one who started it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Tenko’s the one who had to help you when you slipped on the mat and hurt yourself <i>again</i> in Tenko’s lab,” she chides.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “It was just a little fall—I’m fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the back of the group, Gonta’s wringing his hands but says, “But Kaito seemed really winded afterwards…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No kidding,” Ryoma mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pivots on his heel to wave his arms dramatically. “I was just fucking surprised is all! Fucking God, will you all get off my case about this shit—I keep saying I’m fine!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tuts. “Oh, Kaito, talking about God that way is a sin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then maybe Angie’s God will break your leg, too,” says Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rounds on him again, “And don’t think I’m fucking done with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” he says. “Is Kaito going to chase me again?” He takes off running towards the outside stairs back up to the main gardens, calling back, “Careful not to trip on the stairs and break your skull!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi muses, “What an oddly specific warning…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Speaking of which, this might be a kind of morbid question, but I’ve been thinking,” he pauses to fiddle with a cigarette as he suddenly becomes the center of the group’s attention. “What happens if someone does just die from an accident?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is a good question,” Kiibo says. “I suppose in the event of… of a suicide, we would simply vote for the victim since… technically they did it as well. But for just an accident…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Himiko. “But fallin’ down some stairs is different. Do we vote for the stairs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, there isn’t a button at the trials to vote for anything that’s not one of us,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “I don’t really like suggesting this, but I suppose we could ask Monoku—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, so, Angie asked God,” she says, “and he says that it’s kind of not important since nobody else is going to die, so it’s all okay, and we don’t have to worry!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta blinks at her. “God said that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He totally did,” she answers. “And God also says that as long as everyone listens to Angie, we can all live here peacefully for forever!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Forever?” Himiko says. “That’s a really long time… like the longest time I can think of something taking…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Tenko says nervously. “That is kind of because it is, Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a step toward Angie. “So first of all, none of us are going to live in this godforsaken school forever, and second, you’re contradicting yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head. “Hmm? What are you talking about Ryoma? God says you should really calm down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am calm,” he says, voice lowering dangerously. “I’m just saying—what if we all do live here forever? What if we all follow your terrible idea and live here until we die of old age? Then what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Ryoma,” Angie says. “You’re over thinking it! You just have to listen to God, and he’ll tell you everything you need to know. Actually, you know what?” she leans down towards him, “Angie thinks that praying to God would really help with all your doubt and anger issues, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t have anger issues,” he hisses back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot. “Um, Gonta doesn’t think you have anger issues, Ryoma, but he also doesn’t think his friends should fight…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “Oh, Gonta, that’s exactly right! God is super impressed with you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God… is?” Gonta asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup, yup,” Angie says. “Aaaand God also says we should all keep exploring.” She stands on her toes and looks up at the staircase. “Ah, it looks like Kokichi went ahead of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Himiko says. “That’s not good… because we all need to explore together, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” says Angie. “Wow, Himiko, you and Gonta totally get what God’s saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We do?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito darkly mutters to Kaede, “I <i>really</i> don’t like where this is going,” and she nods in agreement.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Totally! Also Angie asked God while we were in Tenko’s lab, and he says we should go to that funny door on the third floor next.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “One of the times was a strange key, right Angie? That door was very strange, so Tenko will protect the girls if we find any danger.” She glances over to Kaito and Kaede. “And Kaito as well because he is injured.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am <i>not</i>,” he groans. “None of you fucking listen to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says that’s a great idea, Tenko,” Angie replies as she begins to lead the group back towards the school, the others shambling after her merry skipping. “Angie’s starting to think that Tenko understands about God, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “Uh, that could be a possibility, Angie…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma rolls his eyes, and mutters under his breath, “I have a feeling this is going to get a lot worse before it gets better…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s trained hearing picks up his words. Up ahead, she sees Angie chattering to Himiko, a hesitant Tenko, and now Kiibo as well about her religion. Kaede whispers back to Ryoma, “you know, I’m starting to think you might be right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, just at the edge of her hearing, Kaede catches Gonta saying, “was that one of the… or is that… no…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to walk instep with him. “Is something wrong, Gonta?” she asks quietly, noting Ryoma almost protectively moving to Gonta’s other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, oh, no,” he says quickly. “Gonta just thought… Gonta just thought he saw something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah?” says Ryoma. “What was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta furrows his brow. “Well, this probably sounds very strange… but Gonta keeps seeing… really fast bugs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “I thought you said there weren’t any bugs out here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… Gonta isn’t sure,” he says. “Because Gonta couldn’t find any when he searched, and when he tries to look at the bugs, they disappear… but that doesn’t make any sense… Gonta’s sorry for bringing it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Ryoma. “It makes perfect sense. It’s like when I do my flash stepping, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta turns to him, some of his old cheer returning to his voice, “Oh, yes, Gonta thinks it’s exactly like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “There are some really fast moving bugs out here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s Gonta’s best guess,” he says. “But… Gonta hasn’t been able to get a very good look at them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe I could help you try and catch one,” Ryoma says. “They’d probably be happier up in your lab anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, thank you, Ryoma,” Gonta says. “After we finish exploring, Gonta will look and you can try and very gently catch them.” He frowns. “But then we should do something Ryoma wants to do afterwards—it’s only fair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma waves his hand. “Don’t worry about it. Taking an afternoon off to go bug catching sounds like fun.” Ahead of them, Angie’s voice spikes in her rambling, and Ryoma scowls. “More fun than whatever other nonsense is probably in store for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks down at Ryoma nervously, and Kaede tries to smile for his sake. She offers the best false words of encouragement she can, “Oh, don’t say that, Ryoma. Everything will probably be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks up at her appropriately dubious to her newfound optimism after their conversation only moments ago. “Is that right?” he says slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Mhmm, I think… everything will work out, and even if it doesn’t, there’s no point getting worked up over something that hasn’t even happened yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta smiles and Ryoma gives her a long look, and Kokichi’s words ring in Kaede’s head. They move with small talk floating between them, and Kaede’s mind runs over Kokichi calling her a better liar over and over again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They find Kokichi waiting for them on the steps up to the fourth floor, sitting on the top stair and swinging his short legs. “Maaaan,” he says. “You guys are soooo slow. Probably ‘cause you had Kaito with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Is that an insult to Kaito’s intelligence or a reference to his recent injuries?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi jumps to his feet. “Both!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Climbing the stairs, Kaito only grumbles halfheartedly to Kokichi as he passes, “I’m still gonna kick your ass one of these days.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi salutes him. “I’ll look forward to it, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi mumbles, “It sure is a good thing Miu isn’t here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie continues to lead the group and though she doesn’t verbally say express that she thinks the door is dangerous, she chooses to turn to Kiibo to present the key. “God told Angie that you should totally be the one to open it, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He takes the key, and Kokichi says, “Ooh, that’s a good idea—that way if it’s booby trapped, we’ll only loose the expendable robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo rounds on him. “I am not expendable!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kiibo,” says Tsumugi. “I don’t mean to be rude, but if you did get caught in an explosion or booby trap or something, couldn’t Miu just rebuild you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well, maybe,” he concedes. “But that doesn’t mean I am going to just recklessly put myself in danger!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So are you going to open the door or not then?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo looks between the group who have noticeably taken a few steps back and the odd door behind him. With a deeply resigned sigh and a note of trepidation, he places the key in the door, and the entire opening suddenly begins to shine with light before the door crumbles into nothing before their very eyes. Kiibo stands in place, staring agape at the new opening.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips over to him, leaning to peer down the new opening and says, “Ah, Kiiboy, you broke it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-It did that on its own…” he says as the others slowly move past him to inspect the passageway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There would appear to be another staircase,” Tenko announces. “Himiko, would you like Tenko to carry you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns, and makes herself the first to begin mounting the new steps. “I can walk on my own…” she mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, wait, Himiko!” Tenko says chasing after her. “It could be dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Tenko is right. Everyone should stay behind Gonta, and—wait, Kokichi!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He calls out the last part as Kokichi speeds ahead of the group, quickly overtaking even Tenko and Himiko ahead of them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems to falter, and Ryoma says, “Let him go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaito. “I mean, there’s worse thing than loosing fucking Kokichi, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems to take offense to that. “Kaito, it is very rude to say that about your classmate, even if he is… difficult. Also,” he points an accusing finger at the group as a whole. “If you truly believe that is so, why did you make me open the door?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie brushes past him. “So, God says we should keep going, and that Gonta should go first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Gonta says. “Gonta will do his best to protect everyone if there is anything dangerous ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The fourth floors sprawls and its strange, oppressive atmosphere spread before them at the top of the stairs. Gonta noticeably tenses at the strange sight. “Gonta will… Gonta will make sure everyone stays safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito steps out from behind to look around. “This place is creepy as shit, I’ll give you that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods as she noticeably pales at the sight. “Y-Yeah… everybody should probably stay close together…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Speaking of which,” Kaede says. “Looks like Tenko and the others already ran off somewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well that was fast,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “You know, this place does seem like it could be haunted—do you think a ghost got them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Absolutely not!” Kaito says quickly. “D-Don’t even joke about that shit. There’s no such thing as ghosts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but there is,” Angie replies. “God says that spirits are all around us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo looks at her quizzically. “Do… do you sense any spirits right now, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah!” says Kaito. “I mean, not that I fucking care…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She tilts her head to one side and then the other. “Hmm… nope! Right now Angie says thinks we’re alone, and…” she closes her eyes and steeples her hands. “And God says we should start our investigation by going…” She jabs her finger forward suddenly down a hall with three odd doors lining it. “That way!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, you think we should check out those rooms?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Yup, starting with the middle one!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She casually begins to skip down the creepy hallway, Gonta hurrying to run alongside her as she pulls the middle door open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko and Himiko are already inside, and both turn to look at them. “Ah, there you guys are!” Angie cheers walking over to Himiko.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow and looks between Angie and the rest of the group filing in. “Tenko is glad to reunite with everyone, but how did you know we were here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, God told Angie,” she says. “And he was totally right!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko hums. “Really? That’s pretty impressive…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s near permanent smile brightens a few degrees. “God is so, so impressive, Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Kaede says, coming to stand near Tenko. “I know we weren’t separated for very long, but did you guys find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko uncomfortably clears her throat. “Yes, Tenko and Himiko already investigated the first room in this hall. It would appear they are all the same, though Tenko has not examined the last one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s good,” Kaede says, glancing around to take in the dark room with its creaking floorboards and dim candle light. “Also… these rooms are really unsettling, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems to shudder. “It’s so eerie in here. I’m almost waiting for a ghost or a demon to just suddenly pop up behind me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-Don’t say shit like that!” Kaito yells. “Demons and ghosts and crap aren’t fucking real! E-Everyone knows that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks up at him. “Do you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I do!” he shouts. “I just—I just really fucking hate people who buy into all that magic and o-occult crap is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko suddenly rounds on him. “Magic is real.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaito says. “No, it’s not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The most emotion Kaede has ever seen crosses her face. “Magic is real. Magic is real. Magic is real. Magic is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, hey, Himiko!” Angie says suddenly, snapping the other girl out of her chanting. “God just gave Angie the best idea. What if we hold your magic show in these rooms?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko’s previous burst of energy seems to flick off like a light switch, and she drawls, “You think we should do it up here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Totally!” Angie says. “You can do a trick in each room to have a three act show. And the atmosphere up here is super perfect for a magic show!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She puts a finger to her lip. “Maybe… I guess we could do that… it’d be kinda hard to move my stuff up here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko jumps to attention. “Tenko will assist Himiko in moving any supplies she needs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta shyly raises a hand. “Gonta could help, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands. “Perfect!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede decides to be the voice of reason. “While that sounds like a nice idea, we should probably investigate the rest of this floor first just to make sure it really isn’t dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, good point, good point,” Angie says. “Also, Gonta still needs to use his hammer, which means there have to be even more mysteries.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko slumps her shoulders. “I’m tired of solving mysteries…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, don’t worry, Himiko,” Angie says. “God will help guide us to all the answers, no matter how hard the puzzle is. All you need to do is pray, and he’ll give you the answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that true?” Gonta asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Mostly just sounds like an excuse not to really try or take responsibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Though I know this may sound a bit illogical,” Kiibo says. “I have to agree with Angie. Whenever I have moments where I do not know what to do, I listen to my inner voice for guidance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mentioned that earlier,” Kaede says. “Is your inner voice… your conscience?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, Kaede,” says Angie. “It’s obviously God.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with that she walks across the room to embrace Kiibo in a hug. He startles at the action. “Uh, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay, Kiibo,” she says. “Angie is just super happy to hear you’ve opened your heart up to God, and it’s amazing that he’s speaking back to you. Angie is so proud of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something in his expression seems to change and his previously stiff posture begins to relax. “You are?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm, and God is, too,” she says. “And as long as God is with you, you’ll never be forgotten or alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can almost physically see the words warp around Kiibo’s head and heart. “I’ll never be alone…” he echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie seems to be almost glowing even in the dimness of the room when she releases him. “That’s right. Okay then,” she claps her hands. “God says we should keep moving.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others part before her as she exits, Kiibo quickly scurrying behind her, swept up in her wake. Gonta moves after them to offer his protection, and Kaede finds herself nearly stunned until she notices Tenko moving into the corner of her vision. “Kaede…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “I’m fine. Just—it’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems unconvinced, but says, “Okay.” She lowers her voice. “Kaede, if you don’t mind Tenko saying, you’ve been acting a bit odd lately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Odd how?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot. “Secretive, mostly. You don’t have to hide everything from everyone else. Ah, sorry if it’s not any of Tenko’s business…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to respond when she notices Himiko approaching again, a sharp pout on her face. “Oh, Himiko,” Kaede says. “Did you need something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks up at them with her eyes narrowed, and Tenko jumps to say, “Oh, Tenko and Kaede aren’t trying to hide anything from you—we were just talking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were whispering,” she says. “You always whisper things all the time and get really quiet whenever I wanna ask what’s happening…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, sorry, Himiko,” Kaede says. “I promise it’s nothing important—just something the two of us were trying to figure out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I could help,” she offers. “I could use my magic or something… I don’t have any MP right now, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s okay, Himiko,” Tenko says. “Tenko and Kaede have the situation under control. There is no need for you to worry yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “But I could help…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows,” she says. “Tenko knows Himiko is very strong, but she also wants to protect her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, knock it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen, and she calls out, “Himiko!” as the smaller girl shuffles out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the doorway, Kaito watches her leave, and turns back to Tenko to say, “You two having a fight or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-It’s none of your business,” Tenko snaps at him. “Tenko is just… Tenko is…” She shakes her head, and calls out, “Himiko, please wait! Tenko is sorry!” as she runs after her for a second time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Tenko disappears, Kaito looks back to Kaede, awkwardly standing before her remaining classmates. “Well,” she says. “I think… they’re just having a little trouble understanding each other. I’m sure everything will work out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “Hmm, the best friends fighting due to miscommunication plot arc is pretty common…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds like it’s a little more than miscommunication,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Sounds like Tenko wants to be a little more than friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it sounds to me,” Kaede says, walking past them back towards the doorway. “That gossiping about people behind their backs is really rude.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eh,” Kaito shrugs. “I can do it Tenko’s face, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes as she pushes the door open. “I’m sure you would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They find the others almost immediately. Outside of an intricately decorated sliding door, Kaede spies Tenko nervously standing to the side, watching only Himiko despite the smaller girl markedly putting Gonta and Kiibo between the two of them. Kaede also hears Angie chanting words of encouragement, and notices that—with the exception of Tenko—everyone’s gazes are trained on Kokichi kneeling in front of the door’s handle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She leads her group of four over, and Kaito calls out, “What are you guys doing over here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie turns to them and raises both of her arms in greeting. “Angie found Kokichi! It turns out he’s been trying to pick this lock.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows. “Why is there a locked door?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Tsumugi. “Maybe it leads to the next part of the school that will open up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t even fucking know you could lock a sliding door,” Kaito muses. “Can’t you just punch a hole through it or some shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s plan B,” Kokichi says, speaking up from his spot on the ground. “Plan A is I just unlock it so Monokuma doesn’t punish me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at him. “Monokuma is going to punish you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm,” Kokichi says, still concentrating on the lock. “He said he needed the door open real so but lost the key, and I’ll get in super bad trouble if I don’t open it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Are you lying, Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Could be! But do you think we should just leave this secret door locked up? It could contain something really important if Monokuma did want to keep it away from us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you were lying,” Ryoma says flatly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out an exasperated sigh. “Well, either way I guess you make a decent point. Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Ah, Kaede thinks I need her permission.” He stands up with a huff. “Hmm, I’m getting bored of this. Hey, Gonta,” he says. “Can you just rip the door off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Gonta looks at him, absolutely bewildered. “You want Gonta to do what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, yeah!” says Angie. “Gonta can totally rip the door out, and then we can see what’s inside!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks around at the group, clearly hesitant. Kokichi continues to prod him. “C’mon, Gonta. There’s probably some super important secrets in there that will let us escape! Don’t you want to help save everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Gonta does,” he says. “But is damaging the school against the rules?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “That is a good question, Gonta. It seems there are many holes in Monokuma’s rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi quickly says, “I-I’m not sure what we should do—and we definitely shouldn’t ask try to ask Monokuma—but it’s probably okay? I mean, he didn’t seem to have any problems with Korekiyo taking down the net in Ryoma’s lab or say anything against our plan to try to lock Maki’s lab…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s also true,” Kiibo says. “However, I still can’t help but worry for Gonta’s safety…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, hey, Kiibo,” Angie says. “Angie really thinks now would be a great time to ask God for guidance. Just try praying and see what comes to you. Angie’ll also pray to help, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… will try,” Kiibo says, bringing a hand to his chin. “My inner voice—God, I mean… says…” He looks up at the others and nods. “God says Gonta should open the door.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yay!” Angie cheers. “You did it, Kiibo! Now all we need to do is have Gonta rip it to pieces!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks down at the two nervously and begins nervously wringing his hands. “Well, Gonta could try…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma moves forward and says much more calmly, “It’s okay. Ignore them. Either inside this door is something Monokuma doesn’t want us to get, which would be a good thing, or it’s a place we weren’t meant to explore, which would also be a good thing. Also,” he looks around for a moment. “We’ve been talking about this for a while, and Kokichi’s probably been trying to pick the lock for longer. Think one of the robots would’ve said something by now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta takes a deep breath. “Okay—everybody stand back, and stay behind Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others immediately move away from the door, and Gonta places one of his large hands on either side of the sliding door. He seems to pause for a moment, readying his grip and then with one mighty pull, he yanks back and the door comes free in his grip, pieces of wood from the top and bottom, raining down in splinters. He stumbles back a few steps, the remains of the door held crumpled in his large hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only then that Monokuma appears. “Hey!” he shouts, waving his paws in the air. “What are you doing breaking the school!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks down to the door still in his grip and back up to Monokuma. “Uh, G-Gonta is sorry! Gonta can put it back!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks at him quizzically. “C-Can you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta can try,” he says, walking over to the now gaping opening, awkwardly shoving it back against the now torn boards as more splinters flitter out and litter the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That, uh, doesn’t seem to be working, big guy,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma huffs. “Geeze, this is what happens when you leave kids your age alone—the second I turn my back you’re tearing down walls and listening to rock ‘n’ roll. Remember parents, supervise your demon brats.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede decides to put an end to his rambling. “So, can we go in this room or are you going to try to stop us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma tilts his furry head. “Hmm, this room? Weeeell, I do have a rule about locking talent labs if the owner’s already dead… buuut, I think I can make a very special exception for this very special room.” He brings his paws to his mouth. “For a very special reason. Actually I was kiiiinda planning on popping it open anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is a talent lab?” Kaede asks. “And also…” she turns to look back at Kokichi. “Did you actually ask Kokichi to open it for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maaaybe,” Monokuma replies. “Just a little bit of I scratch your back, you scratch mine! That’s the way things work in the bear kingdom.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait just a fucking second,” Kaito says, rounding on Kokichi. “Are you fucking working with Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rocks back and forth on his heel. “I don’t know. Would you guys believe me either way?” He grins. “Because you didn’t before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s because you lied,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but see,” Kokichi says. “Sometimes you guys like lies and sometimes you don’t, so sometimes, I just have to guess.” He sighs, “But everyone always gets so mad at me either way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop trying to play the fucking victim,” Kaito says. “Monokuma literally just said you two made a deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just stops for a second before raising his eyebrows at him. “You’re taking Monokuma’s word over mine,” he says wryly. “Hmm, it sure is interesting what starts to become the truth if you believe hard enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And just what the fuck is that supposed to mean?!” Kaito shouts, taking a threatening step towards him, splinters crunching under his weighted step.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie jumps between them. “Okay, so,” she begins. “Kaito, Angie knows you’re mad at Kokichi for some reason, but you should really calm down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘For some reason!?’” he squawks. “He just practically admitted to being the fucking mastermind!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, no,” says Angie. “Because, see, God says there isn’t a mastermind or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blanches. “What? Did you,” she shakes her head. “Angie, what are you saying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to Kaede. “Angie’s just saying there’s no mastermind. Didn’t everybody know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Everybody didn’t. Because there is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaede,” she says, disappointment lining her voice. “Of course there’s no mastermind, silly. Everyone here is friends, you know? And God thinks it’s really bad to doubt your friends like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but Angie,” Tenko says warily. “If there is no mastermind, then why are we trapped here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie seems to consider this for a moment, pressing a finger to her lip before saying, “Okay, so God says there might be a mastermind, but it isn’t one of us and trying to look for one would just lead to people turning against each other.” Her smile begins to darken. “And then we’d just end up back in the trial room!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, I guess that is a good point,” Tsumugi says, hugging her arm. “Also… I really don’t want to think that anyone here would do something that horrible to us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta doesn’t want to either,” he says, dropping the atrociously battered former door to the ground. “Gonta doesn’t believe any of his friends would do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kokichi says inspecting his fingernails. “Now that we’ve got that out of the way, can we explore this room or…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, of course, of course,” Monokuma says. “You know, they say it’s important to foster children’s growing curiosity so one day it will get them killed!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does not believe there are any sayings like that,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe there aren’t,” he says. “But I think of myself as a nurturing father either way. So go explore, find adventure and treasure!” His mouth curls into a smile. “Just don’t touch a certain little black book treasure just yet, though. I want to be around for that part.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that he vanishes, leaving the group to stare at each other in a shared moment of hesitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito, predictably, is the first to break the silence. “So the room’s okay, but,” he returns to glaring at Kokichi. “You were still fucking working together with Monokuma—admit it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi blinks up at him. “I don’t really understand why you care so much, Kaito. Aren’t we all working with Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, don’t fucking try and turn this on me,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, okay,” he says, already skipping towards the new, gaping opening. “I’m bored with this conversation anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just lets out an aggravated groan before looking around at the group as a whole. “Does literally no one else have a fucking problem with this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie steps forward. “Kaito,” she says. “Angie really thinks you need to put your personal problem with Kokichi aside and make up with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Yeah, and maybe tomorrow Rantaro’ll rise from the dead.” He waves a hand, and through the doorway. “Whatever, we went through all this fucking hassle to check out this room, so we might as well check it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have to agree,” Kaede says. “Even if it’s starting to sound like this was part of Monokuma’s plan anyway, we should probably still see if there’s anything useful inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like another Flash Light?” Kiibo volunteers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Getting some more answers would be nice,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, but, but, but,” says Angie. “If there is another Flashback Light, everyone has to promise that it won’t make them want to leave the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because trying to leave the school will only cause another murder?” Himiko guesses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “Ah, you’re totally right, Himiko!” She reaches forward and takes one of Himiko’s hands in hers. “Himiko, Angie thinks that you should really consider listening to God more. He told Angie that you would be absolutely perfect for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would?” she asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup! And God’s never wrong,” says Angie before tugging on her arm. “Now, c’mon Himiko—God says we should pray to him in here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two girls head through the gap. Kaede’s about to announce to the rest of the group her intentions to lead them through as well, when she hears Kaito’s voice shouting on the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Hey!” he yells. “Stop fucking waving that thing around!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, Kaede glances through the opening and spies the very strange sight of Kaito hopping around Kokichi, now in possession of a very long, very gold sword. She picks up the pace to a slight jog as she moves to defuse the situation. “What’s going on in here?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s eyes gleam with a childlike excitement as he experimentally slashes the sword down through the air. Kaito leaps back again, yelling, “I told you to put that fucking thing down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, nothing’s happening, Kaede,” he says. “Kaito’s just being panicky and irrational like usual.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, Kaede hears Ryoma say, “Are you using some really old, probably really valuable artifact as a toy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably!” Kokichi says, swiping it through the air again, making his own sound effects as he does so. “Swish!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking stop that!” Kaito says. “You’re going to stab someone’s fucking eye out!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Though Tenko does not approve of this,” she says. “She also doubts that will happen as Kokichi has not removed the sword’s sheath.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito immediately stops in his panicking and takes a better look at Kokichi who merrily waves to him. “Oh. Well, he should still knock it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” says Tsumugi. “I think Ryoma is probably right about the sword probably being really important—it could be the sword of life, or maybe even the sword of destruction.” She taps a finger to her chin. “Though if it was one of those, that’d mean Kokichi would have to be at least a half demon…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d buy that,” Ryoma mutters, half amused. “Also, it’s probably for the best Korekiyo’s not here. He’d probably threaten to rip out your nervous system or something if saw this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts, but moves to put the sword back. “Geeze, everyone’s ruining all my fun today…” he places it in its former holder and immediately pulls a face at the sight of his hands, now sparklingly with gold. “Ew, now I’m all dirty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what you get,” Kaito says. “Maybe now you’ll finally learn your fucking less—hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins shouting anew, pulling away the loose part of his coat as Kokichi attempts to wipe his hands on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede chooses to take that moment to ignore them, and glance around the near cavernous room. The ceiling vaults above her and her eyes wander up the staircases crisscrossing over themselves to reach every ascending level, each filled to the brim with what Kaede can only assume are precious artifacts from times forgotten.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Or at least, times forgotten by most.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She tugs at the brim of her hat. “This is Korekiyo’s lab, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I believe we can only assume so. The only other people who would have locked talent labs would be Rantaro and Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta crosses his arms. “Gonta doesn’t think this looks like a detective’s study… but Gonta also has never been in a detective’s study.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have,” Ryoma muses. “And they don’t really look like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We never did discover what Rantaro’s talent was,” Tenko says. “However, Tenko still thinks it is safe to say that this room likely belongs… would have belonged to Korekiyo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I was just thinking about something actually,” Tsumugi says, reentering the conversation. “Since we were able to get in here, even if Korekiyo… isn’t here anymore, does that mean we’d also still be able to enter Rantaro’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then perhaps we could find some clues to uncover his talent,” Kiibo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t respond to them, instead moving like a ghost through the room of someone she killed before they’d even lay eyes on it. Her mind helpfully recalls when she entered Kirumi’s lab with the other girl for the first time and how happy she had seemed—how Kaede had called her elegant and she had smiled with so much warmth and life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves undisturbed, drifting past Himiko and Angie seemingly praying together in one corner and Kaito chasing Kokichi around in circles around a display case to the latter’s delight in another. She moves towards a display case near the two boys, and her hands almost seem to automatically fall on a small blue, leather bound book.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede flicks it open as the others move at their own leisure to inspect whatever artifacts catch their interest, even as hers remain fixated on the small book. She turns the pages, diagrams and chants for summoning spirits detailed on each page, and her attention seems to almost instinctually linger on a ritual for speaking to the dead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mouth tightens into a line and she thinks of shot puts and arrows and a million other things she regrets. She thinks of dreams where Rantaro forgives her and how those are by far the worst of all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A shadow falls over her reading, and she glances over her shoulder to see Kaito looming behind her and Kokichi standing on his toes to peek at the book.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can I help you?” she says, not bothering with hiding her annoyance.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah, just wandering what you’re looking at,” Kaito says before pulling a face. “Do you really buy into all that spirit crap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Not really. I mean, I’ve never really thought about too much to begin with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you seem to be thinking about it now,” Kokichi says. “You seem to be thinking about talking to the dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares down at him. “I was just skimming through it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s a good question,” Kokichi says. “So, Kaede, what would you say if you could speak to someone who died?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her throat tightens and she slams the book shut. “Nothing. I have nothing to say to the dead, and I’m sure they have nothing to say to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives her an odd look as she all but throws the book back on its shelf. “You wouldn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says, already walking away from them. “I wouldn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede remains tense for the rest of their exploration of Korekiyo’s lab, and she’s the first one out of the room and down the hall when the others finally sate their own curiosity. Tenko jogs to keep pace with her but mercifully does not attempt to engage her in conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She reaches another door—one splattered with paint—and only waits until she hears the sound of approaching footsteps before pulling it open. Tenko seems on the edge of saying something but remains silent for a moment longer, following Kaede into the almost blindingly white room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They begin their examination and the others slowly pour through the door of their own accord, Tenko announcing to them, “Angie, Tenko thinks this is your lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie flitters around the room in a frenzy, excitedly hoping to investigate one set of art supplies and then another. “Ooh, it is!” She steeples her hands. “Angie asked God if her lab would be next, and it was! Angie really needs to pray to God for this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d hold up on the ‘thank yous,’ if I was you,” Ryoma says, gesturing up to the noticeably uncovered ceiling with his cigarette. “Looks like your room isn’t quite finished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the back door, Kiibo announces, “It also appears that your lab contains a different kind of lock on each of its doors, Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s okay!” Angie says. “Angie likes it. Some people really only are into symmetry, but Angie has always been all about asymmetry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As long as God and Angie are happy with it, I don’t think there’s a problem,” Himiko says, taking a seat on one of several large cylinders of wax. “Also this chair isn’t very comfortable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s because it isn’t a chair, Himiko!” Angie says, leaning down to inspect the wax. “Wow! This looks like super nice quality wax, and, hmm.” She closes her eyes for a moment, hands still moving over the wax cylinders. “God says… that Angie should use these to make statues… the best most realistic statues that she can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that sounds cool…” Himiko says. “What would they be statues of?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“People, of course!” Angie says. “Oh, and, and, and, God also says that Himiko should use them in her magic show!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko places a finger to her bottom lip. “I guess I could do that… I’d need to think about what tricks to do first…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do some really cool ones,” says Angie. “And God will make sure everything goes perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Like the construction of this room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” Angie agrees. “Exactly! Hey, Kaito, have you ever thought about talking to God? Angie really thinks it would help with—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll pass,” he says, instead returning to inspecting the lock on the entrance. “So, like, does this room only fucking lock from the inside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his words, three familiar bears suddenly appear from seemingly nowhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, that, uh,” stutters the red one. “That seems like our cue for us to do… something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-that’s right! We have to, uh, what was it?” asks the pink one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“IT-WAS-THIS,” says Monodam, holding up a key in its metal paw. “THIS-IS-THE-KEY-FOR-THIS-ROOM.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie strolls over to him, and the little robot gently places it in her hands. “Aw, thank you! God says that you are definitely the best robot here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From his spot at the door, Kiibo takes offense to her comment, calling out, “Hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m sure God meant other than you,” Himiko assures him, punctuating her encouragement with a yawn.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In its same stilted voice, Monodam says, “THANK-YOU. I-THINK-WE-SEE-THINGS-THE-SAME. YOU-WANT-TO-MAKE-SURE-EVERYONE-GETS-ALONG. THAT-IS-WHAT-EVERYONE-SHOULD-ASPIRE-TO.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie beams at its praise. “Ah, thank you! Angie will do her best!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam nods. “NOW-THERE-IS-ONLY-ONE-MORE-PUZZLE-AHEAD. PLEASE-LEAD-YOUR-FRIENDS-TO-FIND-ITS-ANSWER. BY-WORKING-TOGETHER, YOU-WILL-ALL-BECOME-BETTER-FRIENDS.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you mean the puzzle with the fake painting at the end of the hall with the three rooms?” Monotaro asks. “Like, where you have to smash the hammer through it or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam turns to him, robotic face darkening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monotaro suddenly begins to sweat. “Uh, w-what? St-Stop looking at me with such a scary face—I didn’t do anything wrong, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam chooses to ominously say. “IN-ORDER-TO-GET-ALONG-WITH-ALL-YOUR-FRIENDS, IT-IS-IMPORTANT-TO-GIVE-THEM-HARSH-PUNISHMENTS-WHEN-THEY-DO-THINGS-WRONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The pink one breaks out into a sweat as well. “I-Is that true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam continues to level increasingly menacing threats at the other two, robotic voice melding into the background as Angie, pockets her new key before saying, “Alright, so Angie asked God, and he says we should go to the end of the hall where we found the three rooms for Himiko’s magic show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… don’t think God told you that,” Tsumugi mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie ignores her. “Alright, so everyone follow Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She marches out of the room, the others trailing behind her awkwardly until they reach the odd painting. Angie stops in front of it, moving her head to inspect it from all angles before saying, “Ohhh, Angie gets it! This isn’t really a painting at all—just glass!” She points a finger at it. “Gonta, hammer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, uh, right,” Gonta says looking down to Ryoma who shuffles it out of his pocket and back into Gonta’s hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He moves in front of the glass wall. “Ahem, uh, everyone should stand back so no one gets hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah, get a move on,” Kokichi says bouncing up and down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “Do you just not have a fucking off button?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie smiles at them. “God is super happy to see you guys getting along. Your friendship is so cute!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Kokichi agrees. “Me and Kaito are the absolute best of friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks at Angie in absolute shock, and his shout of disbelief is promptly drowned out by the sound of smashing glass.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The wall before them crashes down, shattering almost into complete nothingness with a single swing of the hammer. Gonta stands before it, dumbfounded at the strange trick before him. “Should…” he says eventually, “Should we go inside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” Kokichi says. “Me and Kaito will go first!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gags. “I’d rather eat some of this glass—hey, fucking let go!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With little concern for the string of curses being leveled at him, Kokichi grabs Kaito’s hand and pulls him along and into the strange new room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi!” Tenko shouts. “You should not make Kaito run! He is still hurt!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Kaito’s voice echo back, “I am not!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shouts, “Ooh, treasure chest!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. Then, “Does that mean there’s a Flashback Light?” she enters after them and immediately spies Kokichi peering inside a large chest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She walks past the large electronic looking box towering over the rest of the room and comes to stand at Kokichi’s side. He’s already weighing the odd device in his hands, a near unreadable look on his face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between him and the Flashback Light and says, “Is there something wrong with it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi says glancing up to her. “Nope!” he shoves it into her hands. “I was just thinking about how much I didn’t want to have to carry this around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, the others begin examining some of the various computers placed around the room. Tsumugi says, “Oh, Kiibo, what do you think about these?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta doesn’t know a lot about computers, but can Kiibo…” he thinks for a moment. “Talk to one?” he tries.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he could plug into one,” Ryoma suggests. “Try and see if he can download any information or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I actually am not very knowledgeable about computers. Miu would be better for such a task.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” says Kokichi. “You don’t know anything about computers despite being one? Does that mean you’re even more useless than we thought? Ooh, ooh,” he bounces on the spot, “what if Miu comes up here and she decides she likes these computers more than you? Then what happens?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That will not happen!” Kiibo says. He pauses for a moment, seemingly startled by his outburst. “I-I mean, I am not useless, and you are discriminating against robots by saying so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway, speaking of Miu,” Kaede says. “Someone should go get her so we can use the Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Kaito. “And I’ll go get Maki so we can all do it together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at his words. “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “Kaede, we already fucking had this talk. Whether you like her or not, she’s in this mess, too. And it would be really fucking shitty of us not to share information with her, especially about our goddamn memories.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we don’t owe her anything,” says Kaede. “And whether or not it’s a fair thing to do, keeping her away from everyone is for the safety of everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens his mouth, but Angie quickly cuts him off. “So Angie can see where this is going,” she says. “And God says that Kaede and Kaito shouldn’t fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “We’re not fighting, Angie. We are just respectfully disagreeing with each other like two mature people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kaito’s not mature?” Kokichi interjects.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You shut up,” Kaito says. “And also,” he turns to the group as a whole, “C’mon guys, fucking back me up here. Even if you don’t trust Maki, she still deserves to get her memories back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I suppose that is true…” Tsumugi says nervously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta thinks it would be pretty cruel of us to hide something like that from her… even if she does make Gonta nervous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at them openmouthed. “You—you guys,” she shakes her head. “Like I said, this isn’t about being fair—this is about being safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki is very dangerous,” says Tenko. “And… Tenko really isn’t sure about being around her after… several incidents.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki’s a murderer!” Kokichi cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces at his support, but says, “And that’s exactly my point. We shouldn’t handcuff ourselves with what’s fair when she so obviously has such an unfair advantage over us. <i>Especially</i> with the situation we’re in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she can’t help that,” Kaito says. “We don’t even fucking know what she wants—we’re just making stuff up about her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” says Angie. “So, Angie asked God, and he says that’s enough arguing. He also thinks,” she clasps her hands, “that we should put it to a vote!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A vote?” Kaede parrots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup!” says Angie. “Okay, everyone who thinks we should let Maki see the Flashback Light, raise your hand!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie raises her own, signaling the others to start doing so. Kaito does so immediately, followed by a more hesitant Tsumugi and Gonta. After a moment, Kiibo does as well, eventually followed by Ryoma who sighs as he does it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie elbows Himiko and says, “Himiko, God really thinks that we need to share information so everyone can live here peacefully, you know, so we need to include Maki, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks at her, looks to somewhere to the side of Tenko and then to the ground as she, too, raises her hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares absolutely dumbfounded at the seven people before her. “A-All of you really… but, she’s—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, now everyone who thinks agrees with Kaede,” says Angie.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels pure frustration and embarrassment as she raises her hand, followed by Tenko, who is clearly sweating bullets, and Kokichi, still smiling widely.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though it only makes her feel more embarrassed, Kaede quickly says, “Miu would also agree with me if she was here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But then it would still be seven to four…” says Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means we have our answer!” says Angie. “Okay, Kaito! You go get Maki, and Kiibo can go get Miu and we can all meet in the cafeteria together.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her face away from Kaito when he moves to try to say something to her, the words dying in his throat. He mumbles, “forget it,” and walks out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very few of the others look at Kaede as they leave, and she tugs her hat down, bitterly reminding herself how earlier this morning she had been so confident that everyone supported her and Maki was alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stays by her side, quietly saying, “Tenko is… pretty nervous about how everyone is treating Maki,” once most of the others leave. “Tenko fought with her… and Tenko could sense her anger, and,” she looks noticeably uncomfortable. “And Kaede, you should be really careful because Tenko doesn’t know if she could win in a fight against her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I will…” then she lets out a bitter laugh. “And here I thought telling everyone about Maki’s real nature would make them more cautious. Well,” she tries to smile. “At least we have each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And me!” says Kokichi popping up from behind them. “I don’t like people like Maki, either!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s expression of sympathy warps into one of disgust. “What do you want? If you attempt to fight Kaede, Tenko will flip you a second time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but the ground in here is much harder,” he whines. “And all I was trying to do was say how much I support Kaede, even if she is a liar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “What have I lied about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Lying!” he says and prances out of the room, leaving the two girls behind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares after him. “Kokichi,” she says. “Is strange?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a word for it,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s…” Tenko furrows her eyebrows. “Tenko thinks… that Kokichi was telling the truth when he said he didn’t like Maki, or, people like her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “And what does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She bites her lip. “Tenko isn’t sure. We should…” she shakes her head. “Ah, Tenko is sorry for distracting you. We should not keep the others waiting, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her hard, but says, “Alright, if you’re sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Tenko is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The wait in the cafeteria is not a long one, though it is uncomfortable as Tenko and Kaede keep a slight distance from the others. When Kiibo emerges into the room with Miu in toe, she immediately comments on the situation. To Kaede’s mild relief, when Kiibo explains, Miu instantly squawks that she doesn’t want Maki anywhere near her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Some more time ticks on, before Kaito finally enters the room, Maki behind him. With a bright grin he says, “Took some convincing, but I finally got her.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not convinced of anything,” Maki says. “I’m only here because this idiot said he wouldn’t leave until I agreed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means you agreed with me,” Kaito says, seemingly unperturbed by her insult.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that means everyone’s here,” says Angie. “Okay, Kaede! Do the thing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her, but takes a deep breath and flicks on the memory light.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mind becomes engulfed in pure white, hot and seething and searing and screaming directly into her brain. Everything falls away and keeps falling and falling and then…</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then Kaede sees a vision of her own funeral.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And that concludes the very lengthy exploration portion of this chapter, haha. Things should start coming together/being more interesting in the next few chapters if all goes well.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are so many people Kaede has never seen before, and all of them talk about how it was such a tragedy. Candles flicker on either side of her portrait and the one next to it and the next, and the next. People talk about how they were all so talented and it was such a shame.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then she finds herself back in the cafeteria, suddenly out of breath as her head swims with images of her own funeral. She snaps her head up to see everyone around her basking in various states of horror. Kaede bites her lip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu screeches, “What that fuck was that!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s hugging herself, and mumbles, “D-Does this mean we’re all dead? Are we all dead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s standing stalk still, staring at some seemingly far away place. “I take it everyone saw the same thing then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A funeral…” Maki says under her breath. “A funeral for everyone here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s pacing the room, ranting and raving mostly to herself. “Th-This is absolute fucking <i>bullshit</i> is what it is! Be-Because I—I am not fucking dead! I’m not fucking—” she rakes her hands through her hair, “I’m not dead—I’m not dead, I’m not dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo reaches out to her, placing a calming hand on her shoulder. “Miu, please try to calm down. Though I understand that this is upsetting, clearly something is not right since we are all very much alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a deep breath. “Y-Yeah. I… I fucking knew… that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but what if we are?” Angie asks. “What if this is the afterlife?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares at her. “Are you trying to start her going again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steps in. “Everyone—this is not the time to fight.” She takes a breath. “Like Kiibo said, there is definitely something wrong here, so let’s all just calm down and think about it without panicking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaito. “I think we can rule us all being the dead right the fuck out. So it was probably,” he waves hand as if to summon inspiration, “I dunno a play or something. Like at a cultural festival.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘A cultural festival?’” Gonta echoes. “But… Gonta thinks he went to a different school than everyone else…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Well, we’re all obviously missing a bunch of memories and shit anyway. We probably all did a play together or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I find that hard to believe,” Maki says, her voice shockingly soft.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He throws his hands in the air. “Look—I’m just throwing out theories there. All I know is that that shit is definitely not real, so it had to be a play or some crap, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">An unease silence falls over the room before Maki turns away from the group. “I find that hard to believe as well. Why would any of us have done anything together before this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” Tsumugi says. “That this means that maybe we knew each other before somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Maki says to the cafeteria doors as she approaches them. “But I still find this whole thing unbelievable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts, crossing her arms. “Oh yeah? And why the fuck is that, training bra?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki doesn’t react to the insult, instead merely pushing the doors open, saying, “Because I doubt anyone would hold a funeral for me if I died,” and walking out of the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the quiet that follows her exit, Kaito shakes his head, cursing under his breath. “Shit—I need to fucking talk to her or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, so,” says Angie. “Does that mean we’re done?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko juts out her lower lip. “It seems like we didn’t learn anything… what a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs in agreement and glances over the various unsettled faces of her classmates. Amidst the others, Kokichi stands completely blank faced and quiet. A more verbal murmur of agreement passes over the others in response to Himiko’s assessment, and Kokichi finally says, “So, is that what you all think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t understand,” she says. “What else are we supposed to think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His eyes flicker from her face to the others, seemingly evaluating something Kaede can only guess at. “I see. Well, that is a disappointment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That the Flashback Light was a fucking bust?” Kaito asks. “Yeah, I guess I can agree to that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says before breaking out in his familiar grin again. “Not that, but that’s about what I expect from someone as smart as you, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Is that an insult or a compliment?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He presses a finger to his lip. “It’s a mystery.” He skips over to the exit, pressing his back against it. “It sure is a good thing you’re pretty, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes as Kokichi disappears through the doors. Very slowly Kiibo says, “I think that means it was an insult. My apologies, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Listen,” Kaito says with a sigh. “I’ve stopped giving a fuck about what Kokichi thinks for a long time now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko almost involuntarily makes a slightly distressed noise. Kaede turns to her. “Tenko? Is somethin—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing!” she says too quickly. “Tenko was just… was just…” she looks around the room for inspiration. “Tenko was just thinking if we should invite Kokichi to Kiibo’s surprise party or not, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie jumps up, clapping her hands. “Oh right, oh right! Angie wanted to ask if she could do the decorations for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re still really fucking doing this…” Kaito mutters under his breath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You sure as fuck can,” Miu sats. She slaps her hands together. “And that is one part of this hot mess I don’t have to deal with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie seems content to ignore her comment. “Okay, so God wants to know what the theme is—ooh and where we’re holding it, <i>and</i> if it’s supposed to be a surprise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu thinks for a moment. “Well, it’s not a fucking surprise, since Bakamatsu and me did kinda shot that horse in the face… but…” she looks to Kaede for direction. “It’s gonna be a fucking… dead people… party…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi holds her hands to her chest. “A corpse party? Oh, and Kaede did find that strange shadowy book earlier in Korekiyo’s lab… but the school isn’t haunted, is it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s fucking not!” Kaito quickly interjects. “D-Don’t say stupid shit like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “I think Miu means that we talked it over and decided to make it a memorial for everyone…” she sighs. “For everyone who’s not here anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods solemnly. “That is very thoughtful of both of you, Kaede and Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You fucking bet your shiny metal ass it is,” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But then why is it a party for Kiibo?” Himiko asks. “He’s still alive… unless he’s actually—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There are no such things as ghosts!” Kaito shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko reprimands. “Even if you are scared, do not yell at Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not fucking scared of anything!” he shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Yeah, and I’m the fucking pope. But anyway,” she turns to Kiibo. “We figured we’d do it since Kiibo liked Kirumi, even if she was a limp-titted—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie thinks that sounds like a great idea!” she says. “Oh, and God is giving Angie so much inspiration right now for what to make, especially since her lab just opened up. Oh, Kaede, where should Angie bring her decorations when she finishes them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “Um, I think,” she looks at Miu who chooses to mouth ‘I don’t fucking know’ back. “We should hold it… at… the casino.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The casino?” Ryoma echoes. “Can’t say I’ve been there yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Gonta has,” he volunteers. “It’s very nice and there are lots of games.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So that way,” Angie says. “After everyone’s done being sad, God says we can all bond over games.” She clasps her hands together. “And then God says that we’ll all have so much fun, no one will even think about leaving the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not why we’re doing it,” Kaede says, frowning.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head to one side. “Well, maybe it’s not the reason, but God says it will still happen! And,” she tilts her head to the other side, “God also wants to know if Miu finished building the lock for Maki’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” Miu says. “Did you virgins really think a measly little thing like a lock would take the great Miu Iruma anytime? I fucking made this thing finish faster than—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Miu, God says you did a great job,” says Angie. “And he says that Angie and everyone else are lucky to have someone like you around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s face flushes pink, and she begins to fiddle with a piece of her hair. “Uh, w-w-well, yeah. That’s what I’ve been saying since day one…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm,” Angie continues. “And God really appreciates it and everything else you do for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He does?” Miu asks. “I-I-I mean, of course he f-fucking does, ‘cause I’m—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The great Miu Iruma?” Angie asks. “Mhmm, yup, God totally knows and understands completely. And as long as God’s with you he’ll always understand, and you won’t ever have to worry about what anyone thinks! God will always believe in you if you always believe in him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Suddenly Miu begins to look very uncomfortable. “Wh-What the fuck is this shit!? Listen here, you—you little bible thumping, slu—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then Angie moves over to embrace her in a hug, and any words Miu was ready to level at her die instantly. “God will always be here for you, Miu,” Angie says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu seems to freeze all of a sudden, then very slowly she says, “Y-Yeah… yeah, o-okay… I g-guess there’s God or some shit…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a bright smile, Angie releases her. “Ah, God is so happy to hear that, Miu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shifts from foot to foot, nervously looking at the ground. “G-Good. Fuck—fucking awesome, I mean, God and shit, that is…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko steps closer to Kaede, whispering, “Didn’t Angie do something like this with Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods but remains silent, still surveying the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Miu says, reaching into one of her pockets to pull out something shiny and metal. “S-So, do you want—does, does God want the fucking lock now or…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, thank you so much, Miu!” Angie says before turning to the rest of the group. “Okay, so now everyone just needs to give their videos to Angie, and Miu can put the lock on the door.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “I am afraid I do not have mine on me, but I can go retrieve it. Does anyone else also need to return to the dorms to get theirs? I believe it would make sense to do so as a group.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still shaking, Miu says, “Me, too! I mean,” she shakes her head, “I-I can go with you—need to go with you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And with Miu and Kiibo going,” Angie says, “God doesn’t think there will be any problems there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scratches the back of his head. “I don’t really get that, but didn’t we fucking go over who had their videos on ‘em at the trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “We did. The only people who said they didn’t have theirs were Angie, Kiibo,” she pauses for a moment to think, “Himiko, and Gonta. Also we can probably assume Maki and Kokichi’s are still in their rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta blinks. “What? Gonta has his with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie looks up at him. “But that’s not what you said earlier.” Her smile darkens. “Gonta, did you lie at the trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” he says, waving his hands. “G-Gonta just got a little confused.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks over to Kaede nervously, and she comes to his rescue, “I don’t think it’s a problem, Angie. I think he just assumed we were talking about something else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Angie asks. “What something would that be? Even God doesn’t know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Gonta doesn’t know, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did Gonta lie?” Angie persists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oi,” says Ryoma, coming to stand in front of the other boy. “Leave him alone. He says he doesn’t know what you’re talking about. And also,” he glares up at her. “I don’t think anyone here should have to hand over anything to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie sighs. “Ryoma, God says it’s for the good of everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo steps in. “Yes, and I believe Angie is simply trying to protect everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Miu agrees. “And I already built the fucking lock!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko nods. “Angie’s probably right… she’s usually right about these things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clasps her hands together. “Ah, thank you everyone! See, Ryoma, everyone agrees with Angie—we could even do another vote like earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s mouth pulls into a tight, thin line before he finally speaks to address the room as a whole, “Whichever one of you has my video, come talk to me after you’re done with this nonsense.” He reaches into one of his pockets to pull out a video player, then turns, pressing it into Gonta’s large hands. “Do whatever you want with this… it doesn’t matter to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta calls out, “Ryoma…” as the small boy leaves the cafeteria, looking even smaller than normal.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay then,” Angie says. “Looks like that’s everything! Let’s get everyone together to meet at Maki’s lab in ten minutes! Don’t keep God waiting!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, she skips out of the room, Kiibo and Miu following after her, then Himiko a moment later.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors swing shut and a beat of silence follows before Kaito says, “Okay, to talk about the fucking elephant in the room, I really don’t like whatever shit Angie’s trying to pull.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It… is beginning to make me nervous,” Kaede admits. “I just sort of assumed everyone would do whatever they wanted anyway, no matter what she said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “But, Angie is just trying to keep us all safe, right? So it’s okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko…” she says. “Tenko isn’t sure…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta wishes everyone would stop fighting,” he says, eyes locked on the video player in his hands. “After everything that’s happened, all of Gonta’s friends just keep fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta…” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slaps him on the back. “Hey, now is no fucking time to get down on yourself, okay? All we gotta do is just keep working together and believing in each other, and if a fight or some shit breaks out, then we’ll stop it. No point in worrying about any of that crap now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Tenko, finding her resolve again. “Tenko does not know what is coming, but she will use her Neo-Aikido to protect everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Protect,” Gonta echoes. “That’s right. Gonta made a promise to protect all of his friends.” He grips the video player tightly in his hands before staring down hard at the four remaining students. “So first, Gonta wants to know if any of you have Ryoma’s video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko and Kaede both immediately stiffen. Tsumugi gives them a second to exchange nervous looks as she says, “Well, I have mine, and Kaito said he got Korekiyo’s at the trial…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito buys them a second more. “W-Why do you wanna know, big guy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta straightens. “Gonta has been thinking a lot about what Angie said, and thinks that if he was to watch Ryoma’s video with him before it got locked away, everything would be fine. That way Gonta could protect Ryoma and Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think you’re using the term ‘protect’ a bit loosely,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, um, Gonta,” Kaede says finally. “The thing about Ryoma’s video…” she gives one more uneasy look to Tenko before saying, “is that… there’s nothing on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta blinks. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, stepping up to stand next to Kaede in solidarity. “Tenko was the first person to receive it, and she can confirm that it is blank.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” says Tsumugi. “What does that mean? Is there—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means,” Kaede says. “That Monokuma is terrible, and he made a video that said there is no one on the outside for Ryoma. Honestly,” she sighs, “the reason why I kept pushing back the screening until we just ended up not doing it altogether was because I wanted to keep Ryoma from seeing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Suddenly Gonta stands up even straighter. “If that is the case, then Gonta,” even with the video player in hand, he pumps both his fists, “Gonta will protect Ryoma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“From… what?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta will stay with Ryoma and distract him if he is ever lonely, and show him that he has friends!” Gonta announces.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins. “That’s the spirit. I’m sure with a guy like you on the job, he’ll have to stop fucking moping around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta moves to Kaede, handing the video to her as well as pulling another one from his jacket pocket. “Please give these to Angie, Kaede. Gonta will stay with Ryoma while the videos are being locked away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes the vidoes and offers him a smile. “That’s very kind of you, Gonta. Maybe you two could get around to bug catching or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s eyes light up. “Gonta will go suggest that to Ryoma right now! Thank you, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rushes from the room, his pure intentioned determination pushing him forward with frightening speed. With his exit done, Kaede looks down at the videos piled in her hands and feels the ones hanging heavy on her back. “I… suppose we should head up to Maki’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “Do you think it’s been more than ten minutes? I have a feeling Angie isn’t going to be very happy with us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Well, Angie can deal with it.” He walks to the door, casually stretching his arms over his head. “Actually, think I’m going to skip this one. Kaede has my video anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at him. “What are you planning to do instead, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He snorts. “Something you won’t yell at me for. I’m fucking beat, so,” he says, “I was planning on taking a nap until training.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko places her hands on her hips. “Kaito, roll up the leg of your pants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps, hands flying to her mouth. “Tenko, what are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko wants to inspect Kaito’s injury,” she says. “The only person to see it in detail was Kirumi, and she is no longer here to take care of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t need to be fucking taken care of,” he says, rolling his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then show Tenko your injury,” she persists. “If you are fine, Tenko promises she will not mention it again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito crosses his arms and, after a far too tense pause, he eventually complies, sitting down on the ground to begin rolling up his pant leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko approaches, kneeling in front of him, leaving Kaede and Tsumugi to hover behind her. Kaede sees a large, deep red bruise stretching from almost the entire section of his previously hidden leg and continuing up over his knee where his pant leg obscures any further observation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a moment’s hesitation, Tenko reaches out and gently places one of her hands on the bruise. Kaito flinches back at the slightest touch of her fingertips. He seems startled by his own reaction, and attempts to laugh, “Uh, wow, Tenko, didn’t expect you to fucking manhandle me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares at him but does not respond, instead choosing to very deliberately touch his injury again. Kaede watches Kaito's face and the way he steels himself as Tenko carefully applies pressure to prevent himself from flinching a second time. Beside her, Kaede hears Tsumugi mumble, “I didn’t think it would be that bad…” Then louder she says, “It was just the incident at the bug appreciation party, right? Did anything else happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves his hand, frustration obvious on his face. “I don’t know. Kokichi was a piece of shit and tripped me in Tenko’s lab earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He didn’t,” says Tenko, her voice emotionless for once. “He pulled you to the ground once, and you slipped after chasing him later.” She finishes her inspection, and draws herself back up to her feet. “Neither of those incidents should have caused any major complications.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito huffs. He pushes his pant leg back down into place and much more slowly rises to his feet. “He’s still a piece of shit,” he curses under his breath. Then louder, to the three girls watching his every movement, he says, “So, now you know I’m fine and I can fucking leave, right? I really need to…” he waves a hand vaguely, “take a nap or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth forms a tight line but remains silent, leaving Kaede to say, “We’ll meet up with you later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yeah, you guys should head to Maki’s lab anyway. Angie’ll probably blow a fucking gasket if you’re late.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko continues to stare hard at him, and Kaede says. “Sure. See you later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods again and heads out the door. Tenko seems poised on her feet, and as soon as the sounds of his slippers fade completely she spins on her heel to face the other two girls. “There’s something wrong with Kaito,” she says immediately. “Tenko has seen and personally experienced many combat related bruising injuries, and Kaito’s is showing all the signs of not healing correctly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes widen. “Wh-What does that mean? I-I mean,” she shakes her head. “Why is that happening to him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, crossing her arms. “Tenko is not sure. Has Kaito ever mentioned having any other physical conditions?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “In fact, the only time I’ve ever heard him talking about his health is when he mentions how strong he is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko is not sure what to do. No one here has medical training.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And there isn’t an infirmary, is there?” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe one will open up later,” Kaede says. “But that’s a gamble… and,” she tugs at her hat, “someone else would need to die for more of the school to open.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs, hugging one of her arms. “Why is this happening? Did we do something wrong? Is that why we’re trapped here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, the only reason why we’re here is because of Monokuma and the mastermind,” Kaede says. “And right now unfortunately all we can do about that is tear our hair out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Tsumugi says. “Should we just—should we just keep moving? Oh,” she frowns, looking down at the ground. “That reminds me—if Angie wasn’t going to be angry at us for being late before, she definitely is now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stiffens. “That is true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Alright, I suppose there’s also no fighting Angie on this either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She sure is becoming something, isn’t she?” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let’s just hope it stops where it is right now,” Kaede says. “Because… I’m not really sure what else we can do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie meets them with her strange dark smile, but her eyes widen and her expression shifts to something resembling appreciation as Tsumugi hands over her one video and Kaede hands over her five.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands back as she watches Angie check each video, seemingly to examine it for its intended recipient before casually tossing them inside Maki’s lab. Behind her, Miu and Kiibo stand almost like guards, with Himiko only a few feet behind. Evantually Angie throws in the last of Kaede’s collections and brushes her hands together. “Okay, Miu! God says it’s ready now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Were you able to get everyone’s?” Kaede asks as Miu kneels next to the door, applying her carefully crafted lock.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses a finger to her chin. “Everyone except for Kokichi’s since Angie couldn’t get him to come out of his room. Buuut, Angie checked each video and the only missing is his.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kokichi is just hiding his own?” Kaede asks, then to herself, she mumbles, “Why does it seem like it’s always him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Yup. Buuut he also made a deal with Angie and opened the door to Maki’s room so we could get hers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Angie, didn’t you just say Kokichi refused to come out of his room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tenko, no, no, no,” Angie says. “Kokichi picked the lock to Maki’s door, <i>then</i> he hid in his room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her open mouthed for a moment before saying, “You… ordered him to break into someone else’s room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” she says. “Angie didn’t order—she just told him God wanted him to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is Kokichi part of your,” Kaede looks over the group before her, fishing for any word that isn’t ‘cult.’ “Religious circle now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie shakes her head. “Nope! Oh, but that reminds Angie.” She steeples her hands together over her head, and closes her eyes for a moment before saying, “In order to make sure everything stays peaceful, Angie has decided to put together a student council.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Student council?” Tsumugi parrots from behind Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” says Angie. “God told Angie to announce it to everyone tomorrow, so we can begin applying rules to keep everyone safe inside the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie,” says Tenko. “If you do not mind Tenko asking, what rules are you going to try to enforce?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, just little things,” she says. “Like, no going out at night, no using the Flashback Lights, no going down to the tunnels. Stuff like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “B-But if we don’t use the Flashback Lights, we won’t be able to figure anything out about our memories!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From beside Angie, Kiibo says, “Angie explained it that the Flashback Lights will only cause strife among us, as the last few most certainly have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without looking up from her work, Miu says, “Yeah—and strife’s bad and shit. Makes people wanna leave the school, which makes people wanna murder and all that crap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And murder is bad…” says Himiko dully. “Which means the Flashback Lights are bad…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Mhmm! And Kiibo, Miu, and Himiko are all great student council members! Also,” she looks up at Kaede. “Do you want to join the student council, Kaede? God is always ready to accept new members.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Next to her, Tenko takes a step forward, and says, “Tenko will join.” Kaede looks up at her bewildered until she notices the other girl’s gaze fixed at a certain someone standing behind Angie. “Tenko does not know a lot about Angie’s God, but she will do her best to protect everyone in the student council.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi takes a step back. “W-Wait, how many people is that now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie smiles. “Ah, God is super happy to hear that, Tenko! Tsumugi, Kaede, what about you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “I’m not—I don’t really know what’s going on…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, it’s okay if you don’t know right now, Tsumugi,” says Angie. “But just let Angie know if you change your mind, and then Angie can let God know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods, looking around uncomfortably as she says, “Actually, I-I think I just remembered something I need to do in my room.” She looks to Kaede nervously, and says, “I’ll see you tomorrow,” before shuffling away a touch too quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her gone, Angie’s eyes fall on Kaede. “So, Kaede, what about you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances at the others, eyes lingering over each of them to search for an appropriate answer before finally settling on Tenko, who stares back at her with a deeply pleading look. To Tenko, Kaede says, “Okay. I’ll join.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hand in joy and begins to talk about her God again, but Kaede barely hears her over the sound of Tenko’s sigh of relief that she isn’t going into enemy territory alone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The days passes uneasily as Angie easily commandeers the role of leadership in planning the memorial, and Kaede finds herself stuck in the casino until evening, preparing, and cleaning, and half-listening to Miu curse about how she should have thought of a better cover story. Mostly she stays in her head. Though the idea of Angie’s student council unsettles her deeply, Kaede finds she can only do so much to ignore the feelings that well through her when she glances at its chosen members.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu swears almost absently about Angie’s choice to locker herself in her lab while they do the grunt work, and Kiibo calmly listens to her in something resembling a conversation. Kaede watches them and bites her lip. There is almost no question about trusting Miu, and Miu trusts Kiibo, and Kiibo lost someone who betrayed him. Kaede finds it almost impossible not to think of all the people she betrayed and moves a little farther away from them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The fact that Tenko could have easily killed her ten times over does very little to ease Kaede’s paranoid mind, but she stays close to her side as the other girl stays close to Himiko. And Himiko seems almost quietly desperate to be helpful even as Tenko hovers over her from a measured distance.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with only the four of them around, Kaede feels the safest she has in a long time. As evening dawns, Kaede whispers as much to Tenko. “I still don’t know about what Angie’s planning,” she says. “But everyone she’s recruited seems harmless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That seems true, but,” she frowns. “Tenko is still… unsure about all of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s reasonable,” Kaede says. “But, if Angie really does manage to stop a murder—even if it’s through sheer force—does that mean she’s right? You know the,” she waves a hand, “the ends justify the means or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes stay focused on Himiko walking a few steps ahead of them behind Kiibo and Miu. “Tenko still doesn’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They continue their walk in relative silence, the first three members of the student council heading straight to the dorms. Kaede pauses on the path, Tenko stopping beside her, as she spies Gonta and Ryoma standing under the arbor, both of them crouched conspiratorially over the table. Kaede nods her head towards them, and Tenko follows her as she approaches.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you guys doing?” she asks. “Did you manage to catch one of your mystery bugs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They both immediately jolt at her words and spin to face her. Gonta waves both of his massive hands, while Ryoma stuffs his tiny ones into his pockets. Gonta says in a near panicked voice, “N-Nothing! Gonta didn’t find anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quirks an eyebrow at them while Tenko seems almost unable to resist her sneer. “Tenko supposes awful boys always tell lies, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma appears calmer. “He’s not lying. We didn’t find any bugs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The comment seems to relax Gonta, and he says, “That’s right. Ryoma and Gonta did not find any bugs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t bother to hide her suspicion. “Okay… then what were you two looking at?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma and Gonta exchange a look before Ryoma says, “Just…” he sighs, “the stars.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko finds that hard to believe,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Believe it or not,” Ryoma replies. “But Gonta managed to pick up on something our resident astronaut didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks to Gonta. “You did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods hurriedly. “That’s right. While Gonta and Ryoma were… outside, it started to get dark, and Gonta noticed that the stars seemed strange.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Strange how?” Kaede prompts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He crosses his arms, deep in thought. “Strange… strange like Gonta has never seen these stars before. The constellations and patterns are not the ones Gonta knows.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weird, huh?” says Ryoma. “My thoughts are that it means we’re some place really far away, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… could explain something that has been bothering Tenko,” she says. “Tenko,” she fidgets, “Tenko doesn’t remember how she got here, but… isn’t it strange that the police haven’t come yet? We’ve been trapped here for days, and there have been no signs of rescue.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or of anything from the outside world,” Kaede says. She stares up at the sky, and says after a moment, “We can see the sky, but I don’t think I’ve ever seen or heard a plane or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or seen any birds,” Gonta adds. “Or… Gonta doesn’t think he’s actually seen anything outside of the cage but sky.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes one hand out of his pocket to fiddle with his cigarette. “Rescue… probably hasn’t come because of the hunt, or maybe,” he frowns, “maybe whatever that funeral was. Doesn’t explain the lack of planes or birds, however…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence falls over them for a moment before Kaede finally says, “I suppose that means any chance of escape is on us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Question is still how,” says Ryoma. “There’s always the tunnels, but…” he sighs, “that didn’t exactly work out for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s stomach churns at the memory of her first failure. She says, “I,” and clenches her fists, “I still don’t think we should give up on the tunnels. Maybe they’re nearly impossible, but if just <i>one</i> of us was to get out, they could go find help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks to her with worry. “But, Kaede, didn’t Angie say she going down to the tunnels was one of the things she was going to stop?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie is going to do… what?” Gonta asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I think she’s planning on announcing it to everyone tomorrow, but Angie’s trying to organize people to enforce rules to stop us from wanting to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She is calling it the student council,” says Tenko. “And Angie seems to have made herself the leader.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Ryoma. “This officially means she’s going on a power trip, right? With imaginary power?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko wouldn’t say that,” she says. “Angie… definitely believes in what she says. Everything she says about her God—even if it’s inconsistent—Angie believes it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” says Gonta. “Angie is just trying to keep everyone safe, isn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That seems to be the case so far,” says Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shakes his head. “Nothing good can come from this. The way she talked to Kiibo, and then Miu—something’s just not right about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows,” she says. “And Tenko is keeping watch over everyone in Angie’s student council, even Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hopefully that’s the only thing you’ll need to do,” says Ryoma.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Hopefully. Just… hoping is the only thing we’ve been able to for a while now, huh? You know,” she lets out a humorless laugh, “being able to do nothing but just hope is kind of awful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says gently.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waves her concern away. “It’s fine. I’m just,” she shakes her head. “It’s fine. Also, it’s getting late.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glances up at the increasingly dark sky. “Guess it is. You two still doing your training thing with Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito is too hurt,” Tenko says promptly. “But Tenko will continue to teach Kaede Neo-Aikido if she wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “Sure—it might be nice to blow off some steam after today.” She smiles at her, then down at Ryoma, then catches Gonta’s faraway expression. “Gonta? Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma becomes alert all of a sudden. “Gonta, is something wrong? You’ve been quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems startled, and shakes himself at their voices. “Oh, no—Gonta was just thinking about something. Gonta—” he frowns. “Please ignore Gonta, he’s… tired.” He looks down at Ryoma and says, “Good night, Ryoma. Gonta will see you tomorrow… and we can talk about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Ryoma cutting him off. “We’ll figure something out then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods at him and awkwardly shuffles off back to the dorms. Kaede watches him go for a moment before turning back to Ryoma. “So,” she says. “You two are hiding something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” he says with a shrug. “But it’s not ‘throw an impromptu party for Kiibo’ hiding.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at him, but breaks eye contact, instead choosing to lower Shuichi’s hat further over her eyes. “I guess we both have secrets, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess we do,” he says. “Good night, Kaede. Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods curtly at him as he, too, wanders off back to the dorms. Kaede opens her mouth to find an excuse to give Tenko when the girl in question says, “Tenko knows that you are hiding some things from her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t find any words except as she tugs at the brim of Shuichi’s hat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko watches her for a moment, then says, “Tenko knows—Tenko knows that you try to hide a lot of things from everyone to seem strong and to protect them, and that it’s really painful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede summons as much humor as she can as she directs her next words to the ground. “Did you find out all of that from flipping me? I have to wonder what you got from the others…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth pulls into a tight line. “Tenko… has always been able to see if her opponent’s hearts were in turmoil.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So that means?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says shortly. “Tenko… pried into some things she probably shouldn’t have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins on her heel to face the dorms. “It’s fine. We can talk about this later. Right now,” she begins walking, “Tenko needs to make sure Kaito does not make his injury worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede moves to walk in step with her, though the silence remains thick and uncomfortable on the short walk back to the dorms. To Kaede’s absolute relief, Tenko pushes open the doors to the dorms at roughly the same time Kaito seems to emerge from his room for the night.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The heavy atmosphere is lost on him, and he greets them with a wave and a bright smile as he gingerly walks down the stairs from his room. Tenko moves to stand firm at the bottom of the staircase, hands on her hips. His grin falls off his face almost instantaneously. “Alright, what now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are hurt and attempting to exercise will only exacerbate your injuries,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “C’mon. You fucking checked me out yourself and—” his words die at the grim look on Tenko’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You need to rest,” she says, voice a touch gentler.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand through his hair. “That bad, huh?” Tenko does not verbally respond, but he sighs, seemingly answering himself. “Whatever. I’m still telling you I fucking feel fine. You don’t need to breathe down my neck or any of that shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede comes to stand beside Tenko. “Will you rest?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Nah, but there was something else I was plannin’ on doing tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that is?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks at her for a moment, seeming to debate something, before saying, “I spent most of the afternoon in my room, and I heard Maki come back and fucking punch a hole through her wall or something. She must have realized someone went through her stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko believes that was Kokichi,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaito says. “I’m gonna go try and talk her out of giving him a real funeral then if she ever finds out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re,” Kaede says, “still trying to talk to her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” he says. “It’s my fucking job, isn’t it, boss?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns but turns to Tenko. “Let’s just go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glances uneasily between the two, but doesn’t echo a word of protest as she follows behind Kaede back to the doors outside, Kaito retreat back up the stairs sounding behind them. Kaede places a hand on the doors, then presses one finger to her lips when Tenko looks at her quizzically.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Almost directly above them, Kaede hears Kaito rapidly press the buzzer to what she assumes is Maki’s room. His voice calls out, “Hey, Maki—Harumaki. I need to talk to you about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rings, three, four, five, more times before Kaede hears the soft click of Maki’s door opening. She says, “Why are you here again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause I want to talk to you,” he says brightly. “Do I need a better reason?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is a moment of silence, then Maki says, “I don’t understand you. Why can’t you just leave me alone like everyone else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just wanna make friends,” he says plainly. “And I don’t really think you like being alone, so I figured I’d be your friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course, I want to be alone,” she says quickly. “Don’t be stupid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t say you didn’t want to be alone. I said you don’t like being alone,” Kaito says. “Small difference. But it’s a pretty important one, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s more silence, and Kaede hears Tenko shift uneasily next to her before Maki says, “So you feel sorry for me. Is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I—” Kaede hears Kaito abruptly stop speaking, then the clatter of his feet as he moves back to brace one hand against the rail. A hacking cough over takes him, and Kaede hears Maki take a step toward him as he rasps out, “I’m fine—I’m fine. It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The coughing continues on too long, and Maki says, “There’s something wrong with you, isn’t there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gives her a wheezing laugh. “You gonna say that to me every time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “You’re hurt, you’re sick, and you’ve decided to come talk to me. Are you trying to get yourself killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t see how those things are related,” Kaito says, his coughing finally seeming to subside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t think I’m dangerous?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you fucking kidding?” he asks. “I’ve seen your goddamn lab—you could probably kill me a hundred different ways.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you’re just an idiot, then,” she concludes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You didn’t let me finish,” Kaito says. “You could probably kill me a hundred different ways, but I don’t think you will. Just ‘cause someone can do something doesn’t mean they will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki falls silent, and Kaito presses on. “Also—maybe you’re just gonna call me a fucking idiot again—but I like to think most people don’t like killing. So maybe you’re used to it or some shit, but that doesn’t mean you like doing it. And I believe that if you could stop, you would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki goes quiet again before she says, “I feel nothing when I kill people. Did you know that? I could snap your neck, right now and feel nothing. Would you believe in me then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe in you now,” Kaito says evenly. “So, if you really love killing people, you can do it.” Kaede hears more shifting and pictures him standing before her, arms held out to his sides, waiting for her blow. “If all that’s actually fucking true, you can give me your best shot right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede holds her breath, and Maki’s voice rings out, “You actually do want to be killed, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “And it seems like you don’t actually want to kill. So,” Kaede hears more shifting feet, “where do you think we should go from here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think you should leave me alone,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">This time Kaito’s the one to go silent until he lets out a sigh. “You don’t have to push people away, you know. Or at least, you don’t need to push me away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think I’m scared of being hurt by other people?” Maki asks in a dangerously quiet voice. “You think I’m some damsel you can save an—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>I think</i>,” Kaito says. “That you’re afraid of hurting someone—maybe fucking snapping and doing something you’d regret, especially considering where we are. But,” and Kaede can hear the smile in his voice, “you can knock me down as many fucking times as you want, and I’ll keep coming back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs. “I don’t understand you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we can get to know each other,” he replies easily. “We can fucking hangout together tomorrow or something. Some people are throwing a party. You should come.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears the creaking of Maki beginning to close her door, but very quietly she says, “I’ll think about it,” before she clicks it shut.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the sound Kaede pushes the doors to outside open as quietly as she can, and gestures for Tenko to follow her into the night. Alone, Tenko whispers, “What were they talking about? Maki speaks very softly, so Tenko didn’t catch everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment, then says, “I think… it was mostly just Kaito being a good person. Better than me, anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “Kaede…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “We can talk later—we have all night, and if we keep hanging out right outside the dorms, Kaito might actually catch on.” Tenko nods in understanding, so Kaede continues to say, “Let’s skip regular training tonight. I have something else in mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t ask any questions as they sneak across the gardens with only the moon for light or when Kaede leads her to the greenhouse and down into the dark tunnels below. When she finishes descending the ladder, Kaede brushes her hands together and says, “I figured we should give escaping this way one last shot before Angie gets Miu to build something to block it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko finishes the climb as well, saying, “Do you she would do that?” as she steps off the ladder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie or Miu?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, thinking for a moment before saying, “Angie already announced as much, but would Miu really do something to stop us from trying to escape?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I honestly don’t know,” says Kaede. “Maybe I don’t know her that well, but I get the feeling there isn’t much Miu wouldn’t do if it meant fitting in.” She pauses for a moment, letting the dank air settle around her. “I think she and Kiibo might have that in common, even if he does try to be rational most of the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds right,” Tenko says. “You’re very good at reading people, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I’m not,” Kaede says. “I’ve just been paying a lot of attention to Miu lately. For better or for worse, she’s one of the few people here I think we can trust.” She pauses at her words, and corrects to say, “Us, being everyone who’s not the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hesitates for a moment. Then, “Kaede, Tenko was thinking about what Angie said earlier, and,” she shifts from foot to foot, “do you really think one of us is the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says. “I’ve,” she tugs at Shuichi’s hat, “I’ve seen too much evidence to think otherwise, and,” she sighs, “if there isn’t, that means too many people have died for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes flicker up to Shuichi’s hat and then back down to Kaede, staring at the ground with a look of near exhaustion. Softly, she says, “Is that why Shuichi killed Rantaro? He never was able to tell us why he did it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites the inside of her check as Tenko unintentionally twists the knife in her gut, saying, “Kaede, it would have been impossible for you to have known he would do something like that. You can’t blame yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Thank you, but… that’s not why I blame myself. The truth is, if it hadn’t been for me—and me being so convinced I was right about everything—<br>
they would both probably still be alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… doesn’t understand,” she says, confusion beginning to creep into her voice. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a moment to compose herself, and she walks to the tunnel’s entrance, placing her hand against the smooth wall. “I wanted to come here to try to escape one last time,” she says, “but now I’m wondering if I just wanted to remind myself of my first great failure. If I hadn’t pushed every so hard that first day, I wonder how things would have turned out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko remains silent, but Kaede hears her sandals padding against the ground, coming to stand behind her. Kaede asks, “Tenko, when you read someone’s heart, it probably makes it easier to figure out when they’re lying afterwards, right? Since you already know the… emotional truth, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Tenko says nervously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, then,” says Kaede. She squeezes her eyes shut. “At the first trial, Shuichi was the one lying. Everything I said was true. I tried to kill the mastermind, but I failed and Rantaro died because of me. I’m the one who killed him—but for some reason I’m still here, and I don’t know why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The small sounds of Tenko fidgeting abruptly stop. Kaede doesn’t dare to face her. To the tunnel leading out before her, Kaede says, “What do you think of that?” and her voice echoes back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Eventually the sound of Tenko’s footsteps begin again, and she comes to stand beside Kaede, staring into the pitch darkness of the tunnel. “Tenko thinks… Tenko thinks that there has to be more to what happened.” With more confidence, she begins, “Kaede, all of your grief is real, and you just said you were trying to stop the mastermind, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I killed someone!” Kaede snaps at her. “I killed Rantaro! He was someone we knew, and he’s dead because of me! Doesn’t that bother you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks at her wide eyed, but stands her ground. Kaede feels, hot angry tears beginning to well up in her eyes as everything in her head suddenly feels like it’s exploding. “How can that not bother you?” she shouts. “I killed someone, and after going on, and on, <i>and on</i> about how I was going to protect Shuichi, I let him take the fall for me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says, the firmness in her voice stopping Kaede in her tracks. “You’re not making any sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins brushing away the tears threatening to run down her face. “What doesn’t make sense? I’m a murderer—why doesn’t anyone here care about people being murderers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Tenko immediately understands something. She places a hand on Kaede’s shoulder. “Kaede, calm down and think about everything you’ve been saying.” Kaede doesn’t respond, instead continuing to wipe at her tears. “You’re letting your guilt consume you—you said yourself earlier that Tenko can still read her opponent’s hearts… and she knows you’re not lying, but that your guilt is clouding everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a humorless laugh between her slowly subsiding sobs. “Please, don’t make excuses for me. I know what I did, and I know that I failed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said you tried to stop the mastermind to save everyone,” Tenko says. “And then when… Rantaro accidentally died, you tried to take responsibility for his death. You,” Tenko bites her lip, debating her next words, “acted recklessly, but it was a risk you felt you need to take.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was stupid,” Kaede said. “The whole plan was stupid from start to finish. If I had actually trusted someone like I kept going on about doing, or if I had—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There are many things you could have done,” Tenko says. “You can always beat yourself up over your mistakes, or,” she offers her a gentle smile, “you can keep moving, and right now, Tenko thinks you’re already beginning to fix one of your mistakes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that is?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re trusting Tenko,” she says plainly. “And Tenko promises she’ll trust you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede falls silent. She brushes away the last of the tears still prickling in her eyes, and gives her a wry smile, “you know trusting me is what got Shuichi killed, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shuichi was killed by the mastermind and Monokuma,” says Tenko. “You can’t fool Tenko, Kaede. She was there, and she saw everything you said and did to try and save him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath and reaches up to pick Shuichi’s hat off her head, and begin turning it in her hands. “I still failed. Shuichi seemed like a really nice, really sweet person, and I know he believed in me more than anyone else.” She sighs, “and when I think about him, I just think about how much pain he was in when he died and how badly I failed. I don’t know if he’s even a person to me anymore…” she grips the fabric tightly. “And I’m so tired feeling awful about everything, but that’s too selfish, isn’t it? I mean, he doesn’t get to feel anything anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko remains quiet a moment longer, then slowly and deliberately moves to take Shuichi’s hat out of Kaede’s hands and places it back on her head. “Tenko has always believed in living with all your emotions at in the open, but it’s also possible to become overwhelmed to the point of exhaustion, so,” she gives her an encouraging smile, “let’s take a break for now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A break?” Kaede asks, adjusting Shuichi’s hat back into place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Tenko. “We can take an emotional break, and,” she shifts to stare boldly into the tunnels, “and ‘blow off some steam’ from physical exercise like you said earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes another moment to even her breathing before she nods. “Alright—I mean, you didn’t come down here to hear me go on and on about my feelings. But,” she gives Tenko her first genuine smile of the night, “thank you. And also, I know you will, but, please keep this between us. I’m not… ready to tell the others about what really happened yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko promises she will not say a word.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles at her one more time before turning to face the tunnels. “Alright, then. Now that I’m done crying, let’s get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The tunnels are perhaps somehow even more brutal than Kaede remembers, and each pitfall and flamethrower seem to take on an almost malicious nature in their programmed goal to stop her. But each time she trips or stumbles back to avoid a fresh wall of flames, Kaede hears Tenko’s voice ring out with encouragement not to keep going but to do her best.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It isn’t a surprise than neither of them make it even close to the end, and after what Kaede counts as the tenth try, she lets herself collapse on the ground, Tenko pacing around the opening room, trying to catch her breath. “Guess we’re… not getting out… today,” Kaede says between gasps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko… doesn’t know if… it’s possible…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Maybe not… but it’s our only… way out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko paces a bit more, then stops to swallow, collecting herself as she says, “Would you like to try again? Or should we stop here for the night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We should probably stop,” Kaede says, pulling herself to her feet. “I feel like I’m just banging my head against a wall. And also,” she walks over to Tenko and smiles softly, “I’m trying to learn from my mistakes, and pushing everyone to hard here was definitely a mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods in agreement and they make the walk back out into the gardens. On the trail back, Tenko freezes, tugging at Kaede’s sleeve and pointing to the arbor. Kaede squints her tried eyes to see a small but familiar figure sitting on one of the benches, resting their head on the table. She also makes out the outline of a witch hat at roughly the same time, Tenko breathes out, “Himiko,” and heads towards her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko remains still as they approach and stirs only when Tenko gently shakes her shoulders. She snaps her head up in a moment, greatly startled until she rubs the sleep away from her bleary eyes to make out exactly who woke her up in the dark. She blinks at the two girls nervously staring down at her, and says, “Oh, you guys finally made it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “Were you waiting for us, Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yeah. You guys train out here to become stronger and more helpful and stuff, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Tenko. “Himiko, did you want to come train with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says, jutting out her lower lip. “Training’s too much work…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then why are you here?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks up at both of them, and then down at her small hands in her lap. “I dunno. Figured I could watch or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You wanted to watch Tenko and Kaede train?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah…” she says. “But not in a weird way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tenko says. “Kaede and Tenko just finished, but you could come tomorrow night, Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko pauses, seeming to mull over her words. “Maybe. Waiting all night was a lot of work, though…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites back the urge to point out she was taking a nap, and instead chooses to ask, “Why do you want to train—er, watch us train, Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks away and slumps off the bench and on to her feet. “I dunno. I just did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tenko thinks she gets it!” she announces. “Is it like how some people believe you can become good at a video game just by watching other people play it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “I don’t follow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko,” Tenko says. “Do you want to become stronger by watching us train?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I dunno—maybe,” she says as she begins to shuffle away from them back to the dorms. “Training seems like too much work… maybe watching’s too much work, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko immediately starts walking after her, and Kaede jogs the first few steps after them to keep up. “Himiko!” Tenko calls out. “Tenko believes you can do anything if you put your mind to it—even if it’s hard.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that’s true,” Himiko mumbles, pointedly not looking back her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it is!” Tenko insists. “Especially for someone as amazing as you, Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you always hover over—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Tenko knows not to now,” she says. “Tenko knows Himiko is a strong person who needs her space. But, she also wants her to know that Tenko will always be ready to help her if she asks—even the strongest people need to rely on others sometime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They reach the doors to the dorms, and Kaede barely catches Himiko darkly mutter under her breath, “I don’t think you’ll ever need to rely on me,” before disappearing inside.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko follows after her, and Kaede sees the two of them already ascending the stairs up to their rooms. The door to Himiko’s slams shut, and Tenko pauses, near heartbroken on the middle of the staircase, one hand still held out to the small girl. She breathes out, “Himiko…” to the near empty building.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede walks to the bottom of the staircase, and says up to her, “Maybe you should wait until tomorrow to talk to her—give her a little emotional break for right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko turns to her and nods curtly. “Tenko will… tomorrow,” she says. “Goodnight, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Goodnight, Tenko,” and Kaede heads to her own room, her limbs feeling the lightest they have in a long time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The next morning, a second announcement follows Monokuma’s morning wakeup call, telling them all to meet in the gym bright and early.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede already feels the knots in her stomach growing as she makes the trek out of the dorms to whatever new horror awaits them. She sees a few of the others as she passes, each one clearly moving with the same dread she feels—with the exception of Kokichi who merrily skips ahead of her and into the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She enters the gym and immediately moves to stand beside Tenko and slightly away from the others. Everyone files in, and Kaede does not miss the way Maki stays close to Kaito rather than straying to the sides by herself like so many times before. And of course, Kaito is the first to break the uneasy silence, shouting, “Everyone’s here! Now what the hell do you fucking want from us?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pops out from the stage. “I thought you’d never ask!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The three remaining Monokubs appear at the foot of the stage, and Kaede spies a strange black book held in the hands of the green one. Monokuma goes on, announcing, “You’ve all finished your very spooky exploration, so now it’s time for your very spooky motive!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam waddles over to Angie and lifts the book up to her. She takes it easily, saying, “Oh, thank you!” and patting the robotic bear’s head.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam says, “THIS-MOTIVE-WILL-HELP-YOU-ALL-BECOME-FRIENDS-AND-GET-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right, that’s right, that’s right!” says Monokuma. “Because this motive will bring in a new—well, technically old—transfer student!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Transfer student?” Kaito parrots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Transfer student!” Monokuma says. “Using the secrets hidden in Monokuma’s little black book, you will be able to bring back one of your old classmates as a new transfer student to rejoin the game!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “You—you can’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But I do!” he says. “With this motive, you’ll be able to bring one of your deceased classmates back to life!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels Tenko’s hand on her shoulder, and her faraway words attempting to ground her get lost somewhere over the sudden roar of her own heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I think this might be the longest daily life chapter yet, haha. Also I haven't had the time to respond to comments on last chapter yet, so those will be coming very shortly--I hope you enjoyed this in the meantime!</span></p>

<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma keeps talking. Kaede’s mind keeps repeating that everything has to be impossible.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie cradles the small black book in her arms, and when Monokuma finally finishes with a flourishing bow, Kaede hurries over to her in two long strides. Angie’s already flipping through the first few pages as Kaede moves to tower over her. “What does it say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Somewhere behind her, Kaede hears someone—Kaito—breathe out, “You have got to be fucking kidding me.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie stops turning pages to flip to the end, her eyes skimming over the final words. Kaede hears Tenko’s hesitant footsteps approaching behind her at roughly the same time she spies Kiibo, Miu, and Himiko slowly gathering around them. With her student council fully assembled around her, Angie announces, “So, Angie asked God, and he said we can totally use this to bring someone back just like Monokuma said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s staring down hard at the book, rationality and logic leaving her. Maki’s voice carries through the gym. “This is ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah!” Kaito agrees. “Dead’s fucking dead. This whole motive is absolute bullshit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, yeah, fucking science agrees with that,” Miu says. “But if it’s complete crap, why would the furry give this to us? If he’s just talking out of his ass, and this doesn’t do anything no one would shank anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you not hear what you just said?” Ryoma asks. “Whether or not it works, that book is a motive plain and simple. I say we leave it alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta nods. “Gonta has to agree. He feels like bad things would happen to his friends if… we tried anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito waves his arms. “Also can’t we not fucking ignore the fact that all of this shit is impossible!? Dead’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dead,” says Kaede, her voice numb. “You said that already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts nervously. “Kaede…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems to deflate all at once, running a hand through his hair. “Alright, sorry—I know that you’re still not over—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How can anyone be ‘over’ what’s happened?” Kaede snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma steps in as the voice of reason. “Kaede,” he says. “Put everything aside. This is Monokuma’s motive—doing anything with it won’t result in any good for anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Angie, finally looking up for the book. “But you didn’t feel that way about the last motive, right Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s mouth forms a thin, tight line as he glares up at her. Maki’s sigh breaks the tension. “Anyway, without getting into petty arguments, I have to agree with Kaito that this is all plainly impossible, even if he’s being as strange and obnoxious as possible about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins. “Hey, thanks, Harumaki. I think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It wasn’t a compliment,” Maki says. “Nor did I say it out of any attachment. It’s just the logical conclusion anyone not driven by blind emotions would come to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t miss the way her red-eyed stare lingers on her, and is almost grateful when Angie says, “Hmm, nope! Angie already said she asked God, and he says it’s totally possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Though I have to admit I hold a level of uncertainty over this plan, I, too, asked God, and he responded that we should see where the motive takes us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Holy shit,” says Miu. “Kiibs, you can fucking talk to God now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe I can,” he answers. “I have always had my inner voice to guide me when I find myself at a point of indecision. If I ask it, it simply speaks from inside me, however, I did not assume that voice was God until speaking with Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie beams at him. “You’re amazing, Kiibo! And you’re right! God has been with you for a long time—Angie can tell!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie’s God is pretty amazing,” says Himiko. “And if he says to try it then we should probably try it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Tenko,” she says, glancing around at the other student council members. “Tenko is also slightly unsure, but right now she does not see the danger in this motive.” Her eyes dart to Kaede still biting her lip. “And if it does succeed, bringing back one of our deceased friends is an unambiguously good thing, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I getcha,” says Miu. “There’s no fucking harm in trying, right? God says it’s cool, and if it doesn’t work then we’ll just have jack shit, but if it does we get a new zombie buddy to hang around with. Would that be fucking bitchin’ or what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stomps towards the assembled group, throwing his arms in the air. “Okay, what the hell is going on here? Did you guys form a fucking cult or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “Oh, I think I know what this is. Is this about the offer you were talking about yesterday, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta is…” he says looking around. “Confused.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Ryoma. “Someone feel like filling the rest of us in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” says Angie. She moves to stand in front of her five council members, shuffling the little black book under her arm in order to clap her hands. “So, God talked to Angie and he said that she should make sure that everyone can live here peacefully together. Angie thought a lot about how to do that, and she decided to create a student council!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And this student council does… what?” asks Ryoma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “The real question is who was idiotic enough to go along with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Angie’s glad you asked, Ryoma!” Angie says, pointedly ignoring Maki. “Okay, so, the student council’s purpose is to listen to God and enforce a peaceful school life to end the killing game. Everyone is welcome to join!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Gonta. “Does that mean the student council just wants to protect everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Totally. God’s looking out for all of us, and he just wants to make sure all the murderers stop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems to hesitate. “That… does not sound like a bad thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Gonta,” says Angie. “You should totally join, too! With your strength—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Knock it off,” says Ryoma darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head. “Hmm? Is something the matter, Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He glares at her for a moment longer before softening his expression as he turns to address Gonta. “I’m not about to argue that stopping the killing game is a bad idea, but doing so in exchange for living here for forever?” Ryoma sighs. “Even if there is nothing for me on the outside, I can’t accept that—and none of you should either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta looks down to him. “Ryoma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta,” Ryoma continues. “You especially shouldn’t give into this nonsense. You told me you have two families waiting for you, right? Agreeing to live here forever would be a disservice to both of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With those words, all of the hesitation Kaede had seen in Gonta seemed to suddenly leave him at once. “Th-That’s right!” he says. “Gonta will not give up trying to escape from here for both his friends and his families!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Gonta,” says Angie. “That’s too bad. But, oh well! God says the student council needs students to council, too. So that means,” she taps her chin. “Everyone except for Gonta and Ryoma are invited to join.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta deflates slightly at her words before Ryoma sighs, saying, “I wasn’t looking to anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also, um,” says Tsumugi wringing her hands. “You still haven’t really said what the student council does yet… Are you really going to try to bring someone back to life?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Yep! God says we should, so after Kiibo’s party, Angie will get right to preparing for it. Ooh!” she shouts, suddenly turning to Himiko. “Himiko—we can do the ritual as the last part of your magic show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko taps a finger to her chin. “Hmm… my magic and resurrection are two different kinds of magic, but I guess we could do one right after the other. That would mean less work in setting up, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “So, despite claiming that you’re trying to protect everyone, you’re also going to walk straight into whatever trap this clearly ridiculous motive is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Maki,” Angie turns to her, eyes full of pity. “It makes sense that you can’t understand. Angie’s not sure if God loves you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For perhaps the first time, Kaede sees Maki be struck nearly speechless. Kaito steps protectively in front of her, Maki too taken aback to protest. “Alright, just—shut up about your God crap,” he says. “And stop talking about this shitty mo—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” says Kokichi, speaking up for the first time. “It’s more interesting to assume this motive works, so,” he presses a finger to his lips, “who would you bring back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A silence falls over the group, and far too many stares turn to Kaede for her comfort. She takes a deep breath. “I know what you’re all thinking,” she says, voice ringing through the gym. “I’m not going to pretend that…” she tugs on the brim of her hat. “You can all guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko steps beside her. “Tenko is unsure how… resurrection works, but if we could bring Shuichi or Rantaro back… is there a reason not to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I have to agree. Particularly as they both seemed to know quite a bit they were never able to tell us, Rantaro especially. Being able to question them would be a very beneficial opportunity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And they’d get to be alive again, <i>and</i> it would make Kaede happy,” says Kokichi. “But you weren’t thinking about that… probably because you’re a robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-Those things are important, too!” says Kiibo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” says Angie. “Also, Angie asked God, and she says we should totally try and bring back Rantaro! He seemed like he knew a lot, and he’s the only person who didn’t try to kill anyone, so God says he’s super safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs her hat down further as Tenko begins to stutter. “A-Angie, even so, shouldn’t we set up the preparations first? A-And we still need to have the memorial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands. “Ah, that’s right, Tenko! Okay, Angie will go get her decorations and meet everyone there!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She skips out of the room, leaving the scattered tension behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s the first to speak in the awkwardness that follows, her voice a saving grace from the sound of Kaede’s heart pounding in her ears. “Alright, everyone. Whether or not you are a part of the student council, attending the memorial to remember our classmates and ease tensions between us is a good idea.” She gains her confidence, placing her hands on her hips. “For the sake of everyone who is no longer with us, Tenko will even set aside her feelings towards all horrible boys and try to get along with them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Yes, even if the memorial was originally presented as a party for me, I believe that we should use this opportunity to honor the memory of everyone who has passed instead of making this event about ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Kaede. “Things have been really… tense lately, and I admit some of that is probably my fault.” She summons as much cheer as she can. “But the memorial is a good thing for everyone. Coming together and remembering everyone will only make us stronger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” says Himiko. “We already set up all the decorations…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “And it took a fucking long time, so you virgins better appreciate them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces at their comments, and the non-student council members glance searchingly at each other.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Finally, Tsumugi says, “Everyone who died… I didn’t know most of them very well, but… they were still our friends, right? So we should—I mean,” she smiles at Kaede, “I’ll go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta would like to go to,” he says. “Gonta wasn’t able to protect them before, but he isn’t going to let them down now. And a gentleman never forgets his friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Fine—guess you convinced me to. I’ll be there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances to the three remaining holdouts to see Kokichi already skipping towards the doors. “Sitting around moping for people we barely knew sounds pretty boring,” he says. “Buuuut, we all get to play casino games afterwards, right?” He bounces on his heels. “I can’t wait to beat Kaito at everything. I bet he’s a really sore loser.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rises to the bait. “H-Hey! I’m not a fucking—you’re not going to win shit against me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki quirks an eyebrow at him. “I take it you’re going then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” he rubs the back of his head. “I was always planning on it. Wasn’t expecting the student council bullshit, but I’m still going. So,” he turns to Maki. “What do you say, Harumaki? You coming, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares up at him. “Don’t call me that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t answer my question,” Kaito grins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll,” she fiddles with her hair, “think about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s throat tightens at Maki’s words, and she begins to lead the way out of the gym to leave them behind, calling back, “Let’s get going then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The members of the student council had been standing closest to the door and surround her on the trek there. Under the sound of Miu’s inane chatter to Kiibo, she makes out Himiko mumbling, “Are we gonna have to setup for the magic show after this, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko chirps a response, and Kiibo hums to whatever crass joke Miu just made, and Kaede tries to push away how comfortable only being with them makes her. The others move behind them, and she stays firmly in her protective barrier of those she trusts. She also ignores the look she spies Kaito attempting to give her and surges forward to attend a faulty memorial for all the people she killed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They stay divided once they finally reach the casino, the student council remaining together while Maki strays behind Kaito chasing Kokichi again over some new verbal barb and Ryoma and Gonta almost passively accept Tsumugi into their small talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The uneasy peace moves in and then out again when Angie finally steps through the doors, four picture frames shuffled together in her arms. All attention turns to her, conversations stopping dead in their tracks as she says, “Angie’s here! And she brought the most special part, chosen specifically by God!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rushes to assist in taking two of the frames from her grip. Kaede sees her stare wide-eyed at the still unseen picture in her hands. “Angie,” she says. “Your… your abilities are amazing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wanders around her side to stare straight into Rantaro’s drooping green eyes, rendered in nearly unbelievable detail. “These took you one day?” she asks. “They’re so,” she searches for the words, “lifelike.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie beams at their praise. “Aw, thank you! But really you should be thanking God. For all of Angie’s art, she’s just the vessel that God sends his super amazing visions through.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The other begin to draw closer, clearly intrigued. Kaede clears her throat and pointedly takes the portrait of Korekiyo held in Tenko’s other hand. “Where should we put these?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Angie hums, tapping her chin. “God told Angie that we should just hold them and then we can have a moment of silence and prayer before playing games. So,” she walks over to Kiibo, already handing him a portrait. “Kiibo gets Kirumi, and,” she looks back at Tenko and Kaede. “Tenko can keep Rantaro, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to stand in front of Kaede. “Angie will hold Korekiyo because God said specifically that Kaede should get Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows the lump forming in her throat as she switches portraits with Angie. Shuichi’s one visible eye stares at her from under a near identical version of the hat on her own head. Kaede’s eyes flicker over it in all its photographic realness, and she notices Angie decided to give him a smile—the one tell that it’s only a painting.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her reaction is not lost on Angie who says, “Also, God says that since Kaede has been a super great student council member so far, she should get to keep Shuichi’s portrait.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes suddenly snap down to Angie’s smile, and through the roar of her emotions clouding over her, she sees a touch of something more sympathetic amidst Angie’s usual static cheer. “Thank you, Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course!” she says. Then, addressing the group, “Okay, so everyone gather in a circle so Angie can say a few words before we start the prayer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The student council members easily shift into place, and Kaede finds herself between Tenko and Angie with Kiibo flanking Angie’s other side to arrange all the portraits in a row. The others exchange various begrudging looks before slowly forming a circle, Angie’s increasingly dark smile watching over them as they take far too much time to follow her instructions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With everyone gather together, Angie says, “God says Angie should start the eulogy and after that anybody else can say something if they want to. So first, Angie wants to say that she’s prayed super hard after every death to make sure all of her friends would be let into heaven. And that means that even if it’s sad they’re not here anymore, they’re with God, so Angie knows they’re all okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She speaks for a bit more, and Kaede remembers wandering into Angie after Rantaro’s death and how she had hoped beyond all logic that she had been right in saying he was okay somehow. The thought that even with his skull bashed in, Rantaro was alright did not make Kaede’s guilt suddenly disappear, but it brought a peace to her she had known she had been missing since before her confession to Tenko the night before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes darted to the girl in question, stone-faced, for once, holding Rantaro’s portrait as if it was made of glass. Then, she hears Angie finish, saying, “Okay, so, does anyone else have anything they want to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo quickly says, “I would.” He sighs looking down at Kirumi’s portrait, and Kaede does not miss the hand Miu hesitantly places on his shoulder in a halting attempt at comforting him. “I… admired Kirumi quite a bit. She easily took on tasks of carrying for all of us without complaint and handled them to the best of her abilities without ever letting her dignity or grace falter. She was… I thought she was truly someone to look up to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, to Kaede’s surprise, Miu says, “Well, maybe she still is.” The focus of the entire room suddenly shifts to her, and Miu squirms under their stares as she continues. “I-I mean, I always thought she was a fucking frigid bitch, but, you know, she was good at shit, and she was proud of that—even if was just cleaning toilets and crap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo glances up to her. “Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’m just saying,” she says. “That—I don’t fucking know—maybe she tried to kill the gimp, and that was really shitty, but you can still admire her or whatever. I mean, I think she was had a fucking stick up her ass and all that, but… maybe she did some crap but that’s not the <i>only</i> part of her, you know? So you can admire her and shit if you still want to…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s eyes practically glow. “Miu…” he turns back to the group, smiling widely and completely oblivious to the burning blush rising over Miu’s face. “I agree with Miu. Even if Kirumi made some bad decisions, I believe she was still our friend and still an admirable person. And I believe the same about Korekiyo and Shuichi… even if they turned to murder at the end of their lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” says Kokichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo turns to him. “Yes, Kokichi? Would you also like to say a few words?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he asks. “Oh, did you say something, Kiiboy? I wasn’t listening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo sighs. “Alright then… Would anyone else like to speak?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels far too many sets up eyes turns to her. However, Gonta’s voice is quick to ring out over the group, to her endless relief. “Gonta,” he says. “Gonta knows now that he couldn’t have predicted what would happen to his friends, but… he still regrets not being there to protect them. It’s a gentleman’s job to protect his friends, and for their sake, Gonta will do his absolute best from now on to protect everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well said,” says Ryoma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Angie hums. “That sounds like a good idea, Gonta. God will be counting on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Okay,” he says with a confused nod.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” says Tsumugi. “I’m not sure if I have a lot to say, but,” she fidgets with her hands, “I think that we should remember everyone and not let ourselves be overcome with despair over their deaths. We should… keep moving forward with hope for them. At least,” she hugs one of her arms, “I think that’s what they would want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede summons her courage as she says, “That’s right. Just wallowing in our misery and being overwhelmed by sadness—there’s no way they would want that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” says Kokichi tilting his head. “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The silence surrounding the group suddenly becomes uncomfortable. “Yes,” says Kaede, weighing her words. “Of course it is. Kokichi, are you trying to imply something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no,” he says brightly. “I just think it’s funny—that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing about what has happened to our friends is funny,” Tenko bites out at him. “Even for an awful boy, your behavior is simply the worst.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me?” he asks. “But I never tried to kill anyone. How can I be the worst?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words feel like a slap in the face, and Tenko quickly says, “Tenko knows how you feel about—” she seems startled at her own words and rephrases to, “—murder is inexcusable, but there is nothing to be accomplished by blaming them. Everyone knows that our true enemy is Monokuma, not each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi taps a finger to his chin. “We sure do keep saying that, don’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kokichi,” says Angie. “God says that this is your first warning, and if you say anything bad again, then you’ll have to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to pout, tears already forming his eyes. “You’re going to kick me out? But I haven’t even told any lies yet… well, that is a lie, but you know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Just fucking ignore him—he’s a lost cause. Can we get to the moment of silence or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” says Angie. “So everyone, we’re all going to be quiet, and Angie wants everyone to send their very best prayers to God!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie bows her head, and an awkward silence follows her words as everyone exchanges vaguely confused looks. Himiko asks “When does it start?” and Tenko gently shushes her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances around and sees a few of the others have closed their eyes, some seem to simply stare down at the ground, and Kokichi continues to rock back and forth on his heels, giving her a cheerful wave when she makes eye contact with him. Her eyes quickly dart away when he mimes a tipping of her hat, and Kaede’s mind runs afresh with too much guilt and worry to properly form anything resembling the prayers Angie had spoken of.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a few minutes of uneasy silence pass, Angie blinks back up at the group. “Hmm, does everyone feel better now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are we supposed to?” Maki mutters darkly under her breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay! God is super glad everyone is happy now,” says Angie, ignoring Maki once again. “So, everyone should be really careful with Angie’s portraits, but other than that, everyone can go play games!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll pass,” says Maki, already heading to the door. “I think I’ve wasted enough time here already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” shouts Kaito after her. “Harumaki!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t answer back and they hear her footsteps fade into the distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaito,” says Angie. “Don’t worry about her—she’s probably just never had to feel bad about someone dying before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito spins on his heel. “What is that supposed to mean? She’s not a fucking robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I do not see what being a robot has to do with empathetic capabilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Miu. “Kiibs’s got empathy flowing out of his ass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito waves a hand. “You know what I mean.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “I can’t say I disagree with Maki. Being forced to feel sorry for and say nice things about a bunch of killers sure is weird. Of course, we have a lot of killers here anyway, so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip, but Ryoma is the one to rise to the bait, pulling his hat down with a sign. “I’ve already said a thousand times that I don’t do that anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Gonta. “And Gonta believes in Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “Like how Kiiboy believed in Kirumi? Or how Kaede believed in Shuichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him while Tenko says, “Kokichi, Angie already warned you once, and Tenko will not hesitate to remove you from this building.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw,” he pouts. “But if I get stuck outside with Maki, I’ll be killed for sure…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She doesn’t do shit like that anymore,” says Kaito. “Tenko, can you kick him out already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, no,” says Angie. “God says that Kokichi still only has one warning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks up at her. “Is there a reason why you’re taking his side?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just fucking ignore her,” says Kaito. “Kick his ass, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s smile darkens. “Ah, no thanks, Tenko. God still wants everyone to stay together and no one to fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” says Kaito, throwing his hands in the air. “Is anyone else fucking sick of listening to her? You’ve been ordering us around since the trial ended, and I’ve fucking had enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Though I wouldn’t phrase it like that,” says Ryoma. “I have to agree.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh! Ooh!” shouts Kokichi. “I love anarchy!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mmm, but you see,” says Angie. “God says that Angie’s the leader now. We all even voted on it, too, so it just makes sense that everyone—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaede. “When did we vote on that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I also cannot recall voting for such a thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, we did when you guys weren’t there,” says Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, that’s not true,” says Angie. “We did it in the computer room when we were exploring. Everyone was getting all mad, so we had a vote of no confidence against Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her mouth fall open in shock.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “Um, wait, I-I thought that was a vote to let Maki see the Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was,” says Kaito darkly. “Everyone still wants Kaede to be the leader.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaito,” Angie says. “God doesn’t like it when you lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what the fuck is that supposed to mean?” he asks taking a threatening step towards her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” says Angie. “The way Angie saw it, the person who was fighting Kaede the most was you, right? And you were the person who led the vote against her, right? Angie just thought that all made sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stands agape as Ryoma says, “Putting the vote aside, I think we can all agree we still want Kaede to be our leader. Right, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes herself. “Of course. I’ll still try my best to lead everyone if that’s what—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But no one listened to her,” says Angie. “Aaand, four people did die on her watch, so God really thinks someone else should have a turn. <i>Aaand</i> Kaede is also super cool with being a part of Angie’s student council, so there really isn’t a problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie—” Kaede begins</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You still want to be on the student council, right Kaede?” Angie asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glances up from Angie’s unmoving stare to Tenko’s pleading eyes. “Well, I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are you hesitating!?” Kaito yells. “Angie is obviously on a complete power trip with the motive and now this student council bullshit—do something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop yelling at her,” says Tenko, moving between them. “Kaede is trying to talk to Angie right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is she?” asks Kokichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course she fucking is!” shouts Miu, jabbing a finger in his direction. “Also, while we’re fucking accusing people of shit—I know one of you cocksuckers stole my drone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta… doesn’t understand what that has to do with anything,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “It doesn’t. She’s just looking for attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m looking for my goddamn drone!” she yells. “One of you asshole snuck into my lab and stole it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one cares about your fucking drone,” says Kaito. “Right now I’m trying to talk to Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is yelling at her really the same as talking to her?” Himiko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone—“ Kiibo tries to say as the yelling begins to rise.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Kaito, you now have one warning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like hell Tenko’s going to kick me out,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is beginning to think about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the hell is wrong with you guys all of sudden?” he shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d guess they’ve all been brainwashed,” Kokichi says nonchalantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone, please—” Kiibo says again, moving to stand in the center of the group.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hands in the air. “No one fucking touched my genius brain, but someone did touch my—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” says Tsumugi. “I don’t think now is really the time to talk about your drone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaito. “Like I said, no one cares about your shitty—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” says Tenko. “Please do not yell at Miu.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, no one’s listening to God,” says Angie. “And he says that everyone needs to listen to Angie, and ignoring God is a sin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop lording your God over us,” says Ryoma. “No one else wants to join your cult.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, you also now have one warning,” she answers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone!” Kiibo shouts above the noise. “This is not the place where we should be fighting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede makes out his words through the roar, and she steps forward, saying, “Kiibo’s right. We didn’t come here to yell at each other like this. We can talk about these things later, but right now—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Somewhere, somehow amidst the yelling and various flailing limbs, Kaede feels herself be jabbed in the side by an elbow with enough force to send her staggering. Her grip on Shuichi’s portrait falters, and it clatters to the ground in the middle of the circle. Tenko is quick on her feet to assist in steadying her, but at the moment that Kaede recovers enough to beginning reaching for the portrait again, Kaito takes a dramatic step towards Angie and his foot crashes straight through the frame and paper below.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sound of shattering glass immediately screeches all conversations a halt. Kaito jerks his now bleeding foot back with a hiss and a panicked expression as he looks up to Kaede staring down with wide eyes. “Holy shit. Kaede—I-I am so fucking sorry,” he stutters out. “I didn’t mean to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shifts to put weight on his now injured foot and nearly collapses. Gonta hurries to his side to stop him from falling. Kaito just curses under his breath, “Fuck—I’m fine. I’m—fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi presses her hands to her mouth. “Is that your injured leg?” Kaito doesn’t respond, grimacing at her comment as she kneels down to examine the pieces of broken glass still sticking out of his foot. “Ah, Kaito, you should really go sit down somewhere…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito winces as she experimentally reaches forward to try and remove one of the pieces. “Stop!” he snaps, and Tsumugi jerks her hand back. “I mean… fuck. I’ll just,” he looks up at Kaede. “I’ll head back to my room…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta will help you,” Gonta says sternly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m coming, too,” says Ryoma. “I know a thing or two about disinfecting cuts…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A second of silence passes, and Kaito doesn’t put up a fight, just sighing. “Fine. I’m sorry for fucking ruining everything,” he forces a laugh and raises his foot, saying, “Guess I had this coming.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes remained fixed on the destroyed portrait as she says, “It’s fine. You didn’t mean to…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gives her a curt nod and limps off with Gonta’s support. Ryoma follows after them with Tsumugi nervously trailing behind. Kaede finally looks up to see only student council members surrounding her, and she absently realizes Kokichi ran off sometime during the confusion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs and kneels, beginning to carefully shuffle broken glass into one of her hands. “Guess we should clean this up,” she says. “Well, the memorial was nice before this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko drops to her knees and begins to gather pieces as well, Kiibo following her along with a grumbling Miu after sending her a prompting look. Tenko says, “Tenko is sorry this happened, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” she says, her words numb.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu mumbles under her breath, “I still wanna know what happened to my fucking drone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Above them, Angie says, “It’s really too bad what happened—Angie worked really hard on those… Oh well,” she clasps her hands together. “Angie was going to make new sculptures for the resurrection ritual, anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sculptures?” Himiko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Are we still doing the ritual? I’m not so sure about it anymore… so far all it’s done is make everyone fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She carefully moves her pieces to Tenko’s outstretched hands, before standing. Angie says, “Kaede? Did you change your mind? Angie thought that everything that happened would just make you want to do it more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I… don’t think I understand what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, just,” she leans down to easily grab the broken frame, “you know, all these bad things keep happening when you try to remember Shuichi, and Angie’s always thought that choosing not to save someone is just like killing them, right? And Angie doesn’t think that Kaede would want to do that, soooo…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth forms a tight line, and she grabs the frame out of Angie’s hands a touch too roughly. Instead of responding, she says, “I’ll go throw this away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will come, too,” Tenko says, hurriedly displaying her hands full of broken glass to the others before rushing after Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They leave the others behind, and Kaede catches Himiko saying, “I dunno if you should have said that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Said what?” Angie asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She barely makes out Himiko mumbling, “Nothing…” before turning the corner away from them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone with Tenko, Kaede finally begins letting some of tension ease out of her. “That,” she says. “Was awful… Everything about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was a nice idea,” Tenko assures. “Even if,” her eyes dart to the frame in Kaede’s hands, “things did not work out. Also Tenko is sure Kaito didn’t mean too, even if he is a clumsy boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says with a sigh. They reach the trashcans, and she stares down at the ruined picture. “I’m not mad at him. I just… wish I could stop things from falling apart all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko carefully lets the glass fall from her hands and into the trashcan, and Kaede lets her eyes roam over the portrait one last time before placing it in the garbage. Kaede forces a laugh, saying, “I really liked Shuichi, too. I wish I could stop throwing him away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says, a tightness in her words. “Tenko wanted to ask you something. She knows how you feel about Shuichi, and Rantaro, too, but do you really think we should do the ritual?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says with a shake of her head. “Not anymore. I mean, I always thought it was impossible, but I think part of me was just holding on to,” she sighs, “false hope, I guess. I thought last night I had finally come to terms with what happened, but I guess there’s… quite a difference between saying something and actually doing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “It’s not your fault. Monokuma’s motive blindsided us all. Also, Tenko’s starting to think that might be the real trick behind this motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She crosses her arms. “Tenko does not believe resurrection is possible. The flows of energy and life cannot simply be reserved, no matter how much we may want them to. Tenko… also does not believe Monokuma would ever present a motive that would do more good than harm to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s definitely true,” Kaede says. “So what do you think the real purpose is? To get us to fight?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mostly,” says Tenko. “Bringing back our dead friends… Tenko believes it is impossible to approach such an issue without strong emotions, and with tensions among us about what it means to be a killer running high…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The entire thing seems like it’s set to play right into that, isn’t it?” Kaede says. “I… haven’t been thinking about this logically, but that all makes a lot of sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks this motive is designed to make people throw out logic,” she says. “Tenko has always believed in living proudly with her emotions to the fullest, but she knows that it is also easy to become blinded by them and do reckless things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like trying to raise the dead?” Kaede asks with a half smile.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles back. “Like trying to raise the dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Kaede says. “I guess that now raises the question about what we are supposed to do with the motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s where Tenko isn’t sure,” she admits. “Angie seems very dead set on going through with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess we’ll just have to keep an eye on her for now,” Kaede says. “Maybe,” she furrows her brow, “maybe I could try stealing the book or something. But if the motive just goes missing that might cause more problems…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will do her best to try and think of something, too,” she says. “Also, we should probably get back before Angie starts to get suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two head back to find only Kiibo and Himiko standing around. “Ah,” says Kiibo. “There you are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where did Miu and Angie go?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu left to go build more locks,” Kiibo answers. “Angie said she would need one to make sure no one interrupts the resurrection ritual.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede does her best not to grimace. “I see… and where’s Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She left to start making sculptures,” Himiko says. “We were supposed to wait here for you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Kiibo. “While Angie prepares for the ritual, she tasked the rest of us to begin setup for Himiko’s magic show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen. “Ah, Himiko, are you really okay with doing your magic show right before the ritual?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “It’s fine… I talked to Angie, and she said that I’ll do two tricks and then we’ll resurrect someone as the grand finale… It’ll kinda steal my thunder, but, Angie said that can’t be helped…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does not believe that,” she says. “Tenko thinks there is no way anything could upstage Himiko’s magic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko blinks at her and begins to fidget with her hat. “Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk to the school, Himiko languidly detailing which tricks she wants to do while Tenko attempts to sort out the logistics of moving the various pieces necessary from Himiko’s lab to the fourth floor. In the lab itself, Kaede immediately begins worriedly examining the box for the first trick Himiko describe—namely the large saw posed above it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” she says. “Is there a less dangerous trick you could do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko blinks tiredly up at her. “It’s not dangerous if you have the proper magic,” she says. “Are you questioning my skills as a mage?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I do not believe that is what Kaede was trying to say. I think she is mostly worried about moving a large saw out into the open—someone else may try to use it for…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t need to say it, and Himiko answers, “It’ll be fine. We can just make Miu build a lock for the room or something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that is an excellent idea, Himiko,” Tenko says. Her gaze shifts to the large vertical box filled with swords. “Should we do the same with the room for this trick?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, probably,” Himiko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede walks over and gingerly removes one of the swords. To her surprise, it contracts slightly as she moves it. “Are these fake swords?” she asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Himiko. “Most of them are real.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo wanders over to the saw. “This appears to be real… Himiko?” he says. “What is the purpose of mixing fake weapons and real weapons?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because sometimes magic requires a fake weapon and sometimes it doesn’t,” she answers dully.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede continues her inspection of the box, attempting to decipher which of the swords before her are real. She runs her hand over the large variety of slots in the box, noting a slight difference in width between some of them. “Himiko,” she says. “Are some of the swords thicker or thinner than others? Is that how you can tell where to put the fake ones over the real ones?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko seems to pout at her question. “No, I use magic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede senses this is a lost cause. “Got it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh!” says Kiibo, still examining the box with the saw. “I believe I have found a hidden compartment here, which means—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s magic, it’s magic, it’s magic,” Himiko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “Take one side of that and Tenko will help you lift the other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still startled by Himiko’s chanting, Kiibo manages, “A-Ah, alright, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two begin to carefully maneuver the large box out of the room, and Kaede says, “Are you really going to perform these tricks on us, Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. “They’re all totally safe… I’ve never had anyone get hurt during a magic show, ever. And if something like that did happen, then my shows would do the opposite of cheering everyone up.” She stares down at the ground. “They’d be totally useless then, and that means I could do less than nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Himiko?” Kaede says. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” she says. “I’m fine… just thinking about how to help everyone. That’s why I joined the student council and stuff…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right,” Kaede says. “Well, ah, would you like to move the swords while I move the box?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Himiko says. “But there’s so many of them…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko complains for most of the trip, and Kaede tries not to let her irritation show as they eventually make it to the fourth floor. Kaede’s arms are on fire as she places the box down outside the three rooms where Tenko and Kiibo appear to be waiting with their box as well. However, as Kaede catches her breath, she notices the two of them appear to be focused on the familiar sight of Miu kneeling down in front of one of the doors with a screwdriver and what Kaede recognizes as a lock.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko huffs behind her and casually drops the swords in a pile on the floor. The clatter catches Tenko’s attention, and she spins on her heel to greet them. “Ah, Himiko, Kaede,” she says. “Kiibo and Tenko were just waiting for your directions about which room to setup in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” says Kiibo. “Miu finished building one of the locks we need already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause I am a fucking speed demon genius,” she says. “I’ll shit out the other two we need before the day’s over, guaranteed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Also,” he says holding up a key. “Miu built keys for these rooms.” He walks over to Himiko and presents the key to her. “I believe it makes the most sense for Himiko to hold on to them, as it is her show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes it from him. “Uh, okay. If I lose it, Miu can build another one, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you fucking lose it,” says Miu. “I’ll build another one and shove it up your ass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But then you’d have to build a third one…” Himiko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows. “That’s the problem you have with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko clears her throat. “Anyway, Himiko, which room should we set these up in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She places a finger on her chin. “Uh, I don’t like Miu, so let’s put them in the rooms she’s not working on right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins to squawk at her words, so Kaede quickly says, “Okay, so how about the saw in the room on the left and the sword box in the middle?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko nods. “Yeah, that’s what I said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suppresses her sigh, and they begin their setup anew.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Time passes, and evening begins to fall on them by the time they finish. Himiko presses a hand to her stomach. “I’m so hungry,” she mumbles. “Can we go have dinner, yet? I’ll practice my tricks tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds like a good idea, Himiko,” says Tenko. “Tenko will go inform Angie, and we will meet you there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says goodbye to Tenko and leads her group back down to the cafeteria, already packed with the non-student council members. An uncomfortable silence greets them as the others halt their conversations to stare up at them. Kaede opts to break the tension, saying, “Oh, looks like you guys already made dinner. Tenko and Angie will be down in a little while, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, okay,” says Tsumugi. “It’s nice to see you guys…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “No, it’s not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces a smile and takes a seat across from Tsumugi. “Yeah, we’ve been pretty busy all day preparing for Himiko’s magic show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta’s eyes widen. “Himiko is still doing the magic show?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Himiko says. “And everyone better come because I’m so tired…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a nice sales pitch you’ve got there,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito. “It’s just gonna be like fake magic tricks and shit, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko puffs out her checks, and Kaede knows what’s coming so she preempts her with, “First Himiko is going to do two tricks, and then,” she glances around at the others, “then Angie will do the resurrection ritual.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito suddenly goes pale. “Whoa, whoa, wait. I thought we all agreed that ghosts and crap were bullshit, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think we’ve really agreed on anything these past few days,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Kokichi cheers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans and runs a hand through his hair. “It had to be occult crap…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kaito,” says Kiibo. “Are you feeling alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaede gently. “Is your foot better now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Covered in about eight fucking layers of bandages, and Ryoma’s disinfectant stung like a bitch, but, yeah,” he says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, it’s okay, Kaito,” Kokichi says. “You can always lean on me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Hey, the shota is about the right size to be an arm rest, isn’t he?” She begins cackling to herself before yelping. “Who fucking kicked me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could’ve been anyone,” Kokichi says, smiling brightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Kaede says. “Everyone’s invited to Himiko’s magic show, but I don’t think the same is true for the resurrection.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” says Kiibo. “Angie specifically instructed Miu to build a lock for the door to make sure it will go on without interruptions.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but,” says Tsumugi. “Can’t Kokichi pick locks?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo looks down to him, and Kokichi waves back. With a sigh, Kiibo says, “It will go uninterrupted by anyone who is not Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kind of a flaw in your plan, huh?” says Kaito.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “It sure seems that way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, hey,” says Kokichi. “Kaede, what time is the resurrection going to happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She raises an eyebrow. “Are you asking just so you can show up to sabotage it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” he says. “I’d never do a thing like that… I just want to be part of the student council…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you?” Himiko asks. “Angie has a really low bar for joining…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course not!” he says. “I wouldn’t abandon my beloved Kaito to the ghosts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just groans. “Can’t you pick someone else to do that crap with?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, no,” he says. “See, Kiiboy, is just a useless robot, and Gonta and Ryoma only like each other, so that just leaves you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “So you only wanna bone him by default?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand over his face groaning again, and Kaede teasingly asks, “Does that make you hate it more or less?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck if I know, man,” he answers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And though Kaede finds Kaito’s reaction amusing, she also notices Gonta’s face has turned slightly pink and a small smile’s appearance on Ryoma’s face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Dinner continues in relative peace, even when Tenko finally shows up with Angie.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">However, at the end, Angie stands to say. “Okay, everyone, here’s one of the student council rules. There will now be a curfew for all non-student council members. So make sure you go to bed right after the nighttime announcement, and don’t leave until the morning one.” A silence meets her, and she smiles, leaning forward to say, “Don’t worry! It’s just to keep everyone super safe!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs, leaning back in his chair. “I wasn’t planning to go out anyway, but I don’t think I like someone telling me when I can and can’t leave my room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Angie says. “Angie just said it was for the good of the group, and the student council’s purpose is to make sure everyone lives here peacefully, no matter what.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, it’s that last part that worries me,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede senses another fight. She says, “Okay, how about this—me and a few of the other student council members will also follow curfew in solidarity. After all,” she directs a pleading look to Himiko, Kiibo, and Miu, hoping for one of them to back her up. “We all want the same thing, right? There’s no reason to fight over it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede had been counting on Tenko’s support, and the other girl says, “Tenko will also obey curfew if that helps to ease tensions. Kaede is right, we all want the same thing, so we should not divide ourselves over it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says, “I guess I could do it, too… I’m pretty tired…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glances over them warily before saying. “Fine. I get your point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta doesn’t mind,” he says softly. “As long as it helps everyone to stay safe, Gonta will stay in his room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, it’s alright with me, too,” says Tsumugi. “I don’t really leave my room at night, anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’m fucking busted for training tonight, anyway,” Kaito says. “Whatever. Guess I’ll tell Harumaki, too, but she is not going to be fucking happy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi still pouts. “Aw, but I like lurking around alone in the dark at night…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Be creepier,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I can try,” he says. “I can invite some of my ghost friends to back to the dorms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pinches the bridge of his nose. “Shut up. There are no ghosts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “So it’s decided then! Okay, goodnight everyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a moment of hesitation, everyone slowly stands up and walks to the dorms. Angie and Miu part ways with them to head to their labs, Kiibo following along behind Miu after her not so subtly alluding to a new upgrade she built for him being finished.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The goodnights exchanged are far too terse, and Kaede lingers just long enough to exchange a few hurried words with Tenko. She whispers, “Any ideas about the motive yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “All Tenko can think of is just taking it, even if Angie will likely look for someone to blame.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “There’s no doubt that will happen, but at least it will stop the ritual, and if Angie can’t do it anymore, maybe she’ll calm down with the whole student council thing. I’m not sure if she’ll admit she was wrong right out, but maybe something close to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Tenko isn’t sure when we’d even get a chance to do that,” she replies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to respond when she abruptly shuts her mouth as Kokichi wanders past. Very quietly, so only she can hear, he mumbles, “Whisper, whisper, whisper. I wonder what it’s like keeping so many secrets…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He winks at her and keeps walking to his room without slowing his steps. Kaede stares after him and murmurs, “We’ll also have to figure out what to do about him one of these days.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns as she whispers, “Kaede, do you think Kokichi is a bad person? He likes to say awful things, but,” she shifts from foot to foot, “Tenko isn’t sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you not sure about?” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she says. “It’s hard to explain. But, um, goodnight, Kaede. You should get some rest after everything that happened today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she sighs. “Goodnight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that she walks to her room and closes the door with a soft click before walking over to her bed to grab a pillow to scream into.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lies awake, staring at her ceiling and waiting for the morning announcement for far too long. As soon as the screen in her room clicks on, she snaps up Shuichi’s hat from bedside table, places it on her head, and bursts out of her door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others seem to have been nearly as stir-crazy as her, and for once, arrival at breakfast is not a slow trickle but a parade. Kaede leads the group, complete with almost everyone—even Maki trailing at the back—behind her up to the cafeteria.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s already sitting there, bright eyed as ever, with an equally perky Angie on one side, and a half asleep Miu on the other. Angie raises her arms over her head in greeting. “Good morning, everyone! God says today is going to be a wonderful day!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko says, “Oh, well if God says it, then it must be true,” as she takes a seat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone else files in, and Kaede once again finds herself firmly surrounded by student council members. Breakfast proceeds uninterrupted, with a quick reprimand from Angie against Kokichi for breaking curfew that he nonchalantly brushes off, and an odd moment of Ryoma walking up to Miu to ask if he could borrow something from her lab. Still clearly exhausted from whatever she had been up to the night before, she waves her hand and gives him a vaguely positive answer that seems to satisfy him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches him return to his place next to Gonta, who none too subtly whispers, “Did she say yes?” to which Ryoma nods.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s halfway to making up her mind to question them, when Monokuma appears, his three cubs in a line behind him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Looks like everyone’s together!” he says. “What wonderful timing—but then again, being a bear means I am naturally a master at these things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta blinks. “Do… do bears have a good internal clock?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Beats me,” says Monokuma. “But anyway, I have a very special present from me to you that I’ll deliver with a rhyme.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “Oh, don’t even—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone’s up, early and bright, so it’s time,” he gestures dramatically to the Monokubs, “for a brand new Flashback Light!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hops up to meet Monodam already moving towards her. “Ooh, can Angie see that really quickly?” She takes it, turns it over in her hands a few times, and throws it to the ground before stomping her foot on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps, “Th-The Flashback Light!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” shouts Kaito. “What the fuck was that for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma seems to be sweating. “Oh my, oh my. Stomping all over your memories like they’re nothing! Even this bear is scared. But, the key when running from something scary isn’t to be the fastest, just not the slowest! Bye, kids!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that he vanishes, leaving the Monokubs to stare dazedly at each other for a moment. Monodam’s the first to disappear, abandoning the other two without a word. They begin to panic, but their banter gets lost over the noise of Angie saying, “There we go!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at the broken machine crushed under her foot. “That was… that was one of our only connections to the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you know you just destroyed one of our only chances to learn about the hunt or our supposed funeral?” Maki says darkly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others keep staring in shock, and Angie says, “Guys, the outside world doesn’t matter. The outside is the outside and the inside is the inside—what’s happening or what happened out there don’t concern us anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t decide that for everyone,” Ryoma says, practically shaking in anger. “No one wants to waste away in this school except for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stands. “No—I’m done with listening to you. You want to trap us in here—you’re practically worse than Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He moves to the door, and Gonta follows after him, “Ryoma! Wait! Gonta knows you want to get out with everyone, but—” the rest of his words fade past hearing as the doors close and the sound of steps pitter patter down the outside hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s smile doesn’t falter, but no one would dare mistake her expression as anything but furious. She grinds the Flashback Light against the ground with her heel and turns back to the group. With her normal cheer, she says, “God says everyone in the student council needs to come with Angie to her lab to help her set up for the ritual.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is everything finally ready?” Himiko asks. “I still need to rehearse…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s okay,” Angie says. “God says that we should do it tomorrow, so we can make extra sure that everything’s ready to go. Now, everyone follow Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She begins to walk out of the room, and, after exchanging nervous looks with Tenko, Kaede stands to lead the student council members after her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie takes a minute to unlock her lab, merrily talking about how she’s started locking it after finding Kokichi wandering around the fourth floor last night, before she pushes the door open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They follow her inside, and Kaede stops dead in her tracks as she stands completely agape at the sight before her. She had remembered Angie mentioning building sculptures from the day before, but the sight of the four near perfectly made full body statues of their deceased classmates more than caught her off guard.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie walks between easily. “These need to be moved to the room Himiko’s not using so we can do the ritual there.” She picks up the statue of Shuichi as if it weighed almost nothing. “They’re pretty light, but there’s only one Angie and four of them!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu immediately walks over to the statue of Kirumi to begin inspecting it. “These are fucking creepy,” she says. “Also, uh, how accurate are they?” She twists a piece of hair between her fingers. “J-Just so we’re all on the same page.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko moves to lift Kirumi’s statue. “Miu, why don’t you move a different one? Or just watch.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squeaks, “I-I wasn’t going to do anything weird!” as Kiibo moves to pick up the statue of Korekiyo. Miu continues to make strange excuses as Kaede collects herself enough to approach the statue of Rantaro. With a deep breath she easily lifts it, just as Angie said she could.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others begin moving out of the room, Angie leading them, and Kaede makes to move after them when she spies the small black book for the ritual lying on one of the unused wax cylinders. She glances around to see Tenko staring at it as well, with a quick nod of understanding between them, Tenko immediately moves to begin distracting Miu, straggling behind the others.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” she says. “Tenko has some questions for you about your inventions…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She trails off into an overly elaborate question Kaede can tell she’s making up as she goes along, but Miu seems intrigued enough to focus her attention on Tenko’s ramblings. Kaede takes the moment to quietly set Rantaro’s statue back down as a wall between her and the others before silently leaning down to grab the book. She shuffles it into her backpack, keeping her eyes on Miu and Tenko still stalling by the door the whole time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She gives Tenko a quick nod as she swings her backpack back over her shoulders and grabs Rantaro’s statue again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko cuts herself off with a curt, “Never mind—Tenko doesn’t think she’d understand anyway,” and hurries to move after the others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu calls out, “Then what was the fucking point!?” as she chases after her, Kaede attempting to follow behind as nonchalantly as she can.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walk down to the three rooms is short, and Himiko walks ahead of them to unlock the door to the remaining empty room. It opens with a soft click, and Angie moves inside to place the Shuichi statue in one of the corners before instructing the others to do the same. They do so as Angie walks over to Himiko, saying, “Himiko, Angie needs the key to this room. God says you should keep the ones for the other rooms so you can rehearse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Himiko says dully, handing her the shining key. “Is there anything else I need to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” says Angie. “God says you just need to work super hard on your magic tricks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko frowns. “That’s the only thing I need to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” she says. “Angie wishes you lots of luck!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko mumbles, “Okay,” again and shuffles out of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip, following her with her eyes. “Tenko will go help Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll help, too,” says Kaede. “Just let us know if there’s anything else you need for the ritual, Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie will!” she calls out as they make their exit, leaving Angie alone with the statues.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo and Miu part ways with them when Miu announces her intentions to begin the search for her missing drone and Kiibo volunteers to help. Kaede and Tenko wave goodbye to them, but Himiko focuses only on the setup for her first trick—the box with the saw.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She practices experimentally moving the saw up and down and cautiously spinning the blade with her hands. She doesn’t say a word to Tenko or Kaede as she single-mindedly goes about her inspection. After a moment of hesitation, Tenko says, “Have you done this trick before, Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “I need an assistant and stuff, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, well, Tenko would be happy to help,” she volunteers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko finally looks up at her for a moment. She seems to weigh something in her mind. Then, “Okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She allows Tenko and Kaede to see the set up of the box details how an assistant would have to position themselves, all while still claiming the process is done through magic. “And then I lower the saw, but you’re okay and stuff because I used my magic to protect you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods her head. “Understood. Himiko’s magic is very impressive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She juts out her lower lip. “I guess…” she pauses, then, “Everyone likes magic shows, right? It makes people happy seeing a mage do… mage stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does,” says Tenko. “Um, Himiko, also if you don’t mind Tenko saying, Tenko doesn’t think you need to worry about being useful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko blinks up at her. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko’s face flushes. “Tenko just wants Himiko to know that she’s always helpful. Even if you’re not strong like Gonta or good at making things like Miu, you still matter, and everyone is happy to have you around. Tenko is happy to have you around—you can do things to try to be helpful if you want to, but everyone will still value you even if you don’t. And Tenko thinks the fact that Himiko wants to try so hard to help cheer everyone up with her talent shows how big a heart she has.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko looks down at the floor. A moment of silence passes, and Tenko’s about to apologize when Himiko says, “‘m not good at a lot of stuff. Most things are too hard and take too much effort… but everything’s really bad right now so everyone needs to do stuff, and I’m dead weight…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Training to be stronger or trying to be smarter is too exhausting,” she says. “Angie said believing in her God would help, but all that’s done is make everybody fight, so I’m back to just using magic… I dunno if it’ll work, but it’s all I got…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles gently. “Tenko thinks that is very admirable of you, Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, well,” she says, and Kaede catches the slightest blush on her face. “I’m not good at fighting or trials, but I am a pretty great mage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are,” says Tenko. “Himiko, do you want Tenko to be your assistant for the next trick? The one with the swords?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” she says, and Kaede doesn’t miss the way the two walk slightly closer together when they leave the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko goes over the finer points of the box, and after lining Tenko up with it mentions that she’s just about the right height for it. “The real swords,” she says. “Are thicker than the fake ones and can only go through some of the holes, which angle them in positions where it won’t actually hit you. But you’ll still have a bunch of fake ones poking you, which can get kind of annoying…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can handle that,” she says. “As long as Himiko uses her magic, Tenko knows she has nothing to worry about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko nods. “Right, uh,” she places a finger on her lower lip. “Did I explain the saw one very well? I can’t remember…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will be happy to listen to Himiko’s explanation again,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Kaede speaks up. “Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to run through both of them just to make sure everything’s safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, right,” says Himiko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches warily as Tenko stands in the box, and Himiko gingerly positions the swords through, weighing each one deliberately in her hands before sliding them in. The day turns to night, and after a few test trials, Angie ducks into their room to clap for the fact that Tenko remains unskewered before dashing back out. Her approval seems to satisfy Himiko enough to direct them back to the first room to go over the saw box again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though already having explained it once, Himiko goes over the various compartments in greater detail, running through the set up once without anyone inside before directing Tenko to try it. Despite knowing the trick behind it, Kaede holds her breath for the entire performance and silently admits to herself that there is something inherently exciting about magic tricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko again emerges unharmed, and Kaede claps as Himiko bows. The movement, however, causes something shiny from her pocket to slip out and tumble through the loose floorboards. Himiko’s eyes widen and she drops to her hands and knees, peering through the gaps in the floor. Tenko immediately gets down on the floor beside her, asking, “Was that one of the keys?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko shoves her hand into her pocket to check. With a frown she says, “Yeah—one of ‘em.” She moves back to the floor and attempts to slide her fingers through the gaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” says Kaede. “Himiko, I don’t think your arm’s thin enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But I need to get it back,” she pouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gently, Tenko says, “Ah, Himiko, Tenko would like to help, but it is starting to get late. Perhaps we should go to bed and try to retrieve it in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko sits up. “But don’t I need to lock the room to make sure nobody uses the saw for bad things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yes,” says Kaede. “But with Angie’s curfew, I don’t know if we’ll need to worry about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko seems to consider her words but looks back down at the key glittering through the floorboards with determined eyes. “I’ll be there later. I wanna try a few more spells first to get it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is about to protest, but Tenko says, “Okay, Himiko. Tenko knows you can do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “I just need to recharge my MP a little first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Of course, goodnight, Himiko. We will come by early tomorrow morning to help with any last minute preparations.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” she says back, and Tenko escorts Kaede out of the room, the door swinging shut silently behind them. “Night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk down the hall in quiet until safely out of earshot, and Kaede says, “Do you think she’ll get it back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure, but it will be fine either way,” she says. “Mostly, Tenko knows that Himiko needs to feel independent to get her confidence up. Telling her she should stop trying would not be helpful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That makes sense,” says Kaede. “Also, what do you think I should do with the book now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Tenko… doesn’t know, but at least Angie hasn’t seemed to notice it’s missing yet since she didn’t ask us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, I guess we’ll just have to thank our luck for that,” she says. “I hope Angie’s not too angry when she finds out it’s gone. Going off of what happened this morning, she’ll probably blame Ryoma, and then poor Gonta will probably get in the middle of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tenko says. “But that can’t really be helped… Tenko supposes that the important thing is that now the ritual can’t happen, whatever it was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” Kaede says shaking her head. “It’s just so hard to know if you’re making the right call sometimes, you know? There have been so many times where I’m so sure I’m on the right track with something, and then, well, not great things happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hums in agreement. “Tenko thinks that’s what being a leader is. We just have to do the best we can with the information we have and live as positively as we can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles. “That’s a nice way to think about things—all we can do is keep living positively, and get an early start tomorrow since you promised Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles back, and they say their goodnights, unaware of so many things happening around them at that moment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wakes up before the morning announcement to the sound of Tenko ringing her doorbell. She gets dressed promptly, and the two exchange good mornings before heading along the garden path to the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The morning announcement sounds as they climb the steps up to the second floor, signaling Angie’s imposed curfew’s end for the others. Kaede’s about to comment on that when they spy Himiko coming down the staircase in front of them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Himiko? Did you already finish—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stops abruptly as Himiko dashes over with more speed than Kaede’s ever seen her move at to wrap her arms around Tenko’s waist. “Ah,” Tenko’s face flushes bright red. “Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko seems to hug her tighter for a moment before letting go. She steps back from them and adjusts her hat. “Was that weird?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No!” Tenko stutters, still blushing wildly. “Just unexpected.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Himiko hums. “Okay. Also, here’s the keys to the magic rooms.” Tenko looks down confused as she places the two keys in her hands. “That’s everything… I’ll be going then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves past them, taking the stairs two at a time. Tenko calls, “Himiko!?” after her but she doesn’t stop in her strangely hurried movements.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was odd,” Kaede says. “Do you think everything’s alright with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she mumbles.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe she just has stage fright?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Tenko says. “Let’s check the set up for the magic show. Maybe Himiko needs help with something and is too embarrassed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, and they continue on their way up to the fourth floor, slightly more confused than they were.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Outside the three rooms, another familiar face greets them as Kokichi rocks back and forth on his heels with his hands behind his back, whistling innocently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at him. “Kokichi? What are you doing up here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, just trying to get a preview of Himiko’s show,” he says skipping over to them, hands still folded behind him. “What are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “We told Himiko we’d help her set up this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, did you?” he says. “That’s interesting…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you say so,” she says tiredly. “Kokichi, can you move out of the way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, sure,” Kokichi says. “I just want to show Kaede one thing. It’s a magic trick I’ve been trying, but I’m not having any luck…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Did you want Himiko to help you with it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “But she told me she was too busy. So, Kaede, let me see your hands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She regards him warily. “What are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs his cheeks out. “I just told you, I’m going to do a magic trick. C’mon, we don’t have all day!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you leave us alone if I do?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As alone as I can!” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that she moves her hands out in front of her and catches sight of something metal and shiny he had been hiding behind his back a second too late.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spies it, too, and shouts, “Kaede!” as Kaede attempts to jerk back and out of his reach. She feels cold metal bite against her wrist and the even colder revelation of her current predicament prickle down her spine.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi raises his hand in the air, which causes Kaede’s now handcuffed hand to rise with him. “Ta-da!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls back, pulling Kokichi with her, and attempts to yank her hand out. “What!? Why—why!? Get it off!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pouts. “You don’t like my trick, Kaede-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is not a magic trick!” she shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it is a trick,” he answers grinning deviously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says. “Kokichi, give us the key now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would, but I don’t have it,” he says. “And also these locks are too hard too pick. I even practiced on the other ones in Ryoma’s lab, and I couldn’t open any of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is absolutely a lie,” says Kaede. “Get this off of me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Off of us,” he corrects.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, I swear,” she says. “This is not funny.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t do it to be funny,” Kokichi says. “I did it to be safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How does that make any sense?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He places a finger from his free hand against his lips. “It’s a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks them over, and says, “Maybe we can find Miu and ask her to make a key.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s a good idea,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko was not talking to you,” she says sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway!” says Kokichi. “Didn’t you say you wanted to help setup Himiko’s magic show?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which we’ll do,” Kaede says. “After you get this off of me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Off of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is going to use you as a punching bag after this,” she says darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He salutes her. “I’ll look forward to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are actually the worst,” Kaede says. “What is wrong with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s wrong,” Kokichi says. “Is that I’m still having trouble with my magic tricks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko turns her expression of disgust from him to a more sympathetic one as she addresses Kaede. “Should we still see if there’s anything wrong with Himiko’s magic show? Tenko would understand if you didn’t want to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment and sighs. “No, it’s fine. Checking out a few things shouldn’t take long anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yay!” says Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko curls her lip up at him. “Tenko can check one room, and you and… Kokichi can check the other to speed things up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good idea,” says Kaede. “The faster this is over the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hands her one of the keys, “Tenko… <i>thinks</i> this is for the room with the saw. So, Tenko will check the room with the swords.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes it from her, having to snatch it fast to avoid Kokichi’s hands from grabbing it. She glares down at him, and he beams back up at her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko walks past them to her door as Kaede unlocks the one closest to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She and Kokichi step inside the candle lit room, and Kaede immediately notices that the saw is no longer poised above the box. She’s about to comment on it when she hears Tenko’s scream coming through the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She whips her head towards the noise, and a familiar chime starts to play. “A body has been disco—” and then cuts off abruptly, dying out with a strange distorted noise.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everything seems to go oddly quiet, and Kaede rushes back out the door, dragging Kokichi along behind her. She pushes it open and discovers that the dim lights previously lighting the hall have been shut off completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door behind them closes, and Kaede finds herself in complete darkness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everybody loves a cliffhanger, right? Also Kiiruma is officially tagged now, since, well, I realized there's quite a lot of it, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For a single moment, everything is absolutely still and absolutely dark. Kaede blinks her eyes, but in the hallway, cutoff from any windows, only darkness greets.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The first touches of panic begin to come over her when she feels the handcuffs bite into her wrist as Kokichi moves around behind her. She’s about to question him when the door to the middle room suddenly swings open, illuminating a small patch of light around the entrance from the candles inside. Tenko stands framed in the darkness a far too familiar look of horror on her face. A look Kaede remembers seeing when she had told her she found blood in the gym so long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” she says. “Kaede, there’s—” She looks up suddenly seeming to notice the darkness all at once. “What—what happened to the lights?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries over to her, pulling Kokichi along behind easily enough. “I don’t know. But, Tenko,” she says. “The body announcement started to play. Is someone…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The surprise vanishes from Tenko’s face, replaced by a grim expression. “Yes. It’s,” she takes a deep breath, her hands curling into fists. “Kaede… Gonta is dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat constrict, and her chest tightens as if someone was physically crushing her heart in their fist. “How did…” she says. “How could anyone…” She squeezes her eyes shut as she attempts to gather herself. “Let me see him. We need to investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “But that’s going to be really hard to do with no lights…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There are candles in the room,” Kaede says. “And…” she takes another breath, “and I want to see the body before we get…” Ryoma flashes through her mind, “everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods and moves back into the room, holding the door open for Kaede and Kokichi to pass through as well. Any mental preparations Kaede had made to steel herself evaporate at the sight of the room, transformed in such a twisted manner from the night before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The four statues Angie had created the day before now stand in each dark corner, a sword thrust through the stomachs of all but the one of Shuichi. The sight of that alone would be enough to stop her dead in her tracks, but in the center, Kaede sees poor Gonta’s body leaning almost upright against the walls of the sword box, the door to it limply hanging open, help ajar by his massive shoulder, his frame too large to properly fit in the death trap.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her hands held over her mouth, Kaede approaches slowly, Kokichi moving alongside her silently. Closer up, she sees dried blood darkening his once neat jacket and dress shirt. Her eyes flicker over his body, and still staring at the gory image before her she says, “Was… was he stabbed by one of Himiko’s swords?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t know,” she gestures down to a pile of swords, fake and real alike, near the box. “It seems possible, but Tenko doesn’t want to believe that could happen. Himiko said all her tricks were completely safe… Tenko even stood… Tenko even…” she shakes her head again, “How could this have happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses her hands to her face, finally tearing her eyes away from Gonta’s body. “I don’t know. I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Easy,” says Kokichi. “Someone wanted to escape, and Gonta was probably in the wrong place at the wrong time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jerks her head to look at him, and he coolly stares up at her. “How can you just say something like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Am I wrong?” he asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mouth forms a thin, tight line as she continues to glare at him. After a moment she turns to Tenko. “We should try and find the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “But didn’t all the lights turn off? Ooh, ooh! Does Tenko have night vision?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Tenko exchange a look before Kaede sighs. “As much as I hate to say it, he has a point. The hallway outside is pitch black—I don’t know if I even could have found my way to this room if you hadn’t opened the door.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>And</i>,” says Kokichi. “We don’t know how much of the school’s power is off! What if everything is super dark and spooky now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks down at him. “That’s actually… wait,” she turns to Tenko. “Is it just the lights that turned off? The announcement got weirdly cut off, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns and moves to grab something out of her pocket. She pauses in confusion for a moment before bringing out her monopad in one hand and a key in the other. Kaede’s stares down at it curiously while Tenko seems absolutely baffled by its presence. “Tenko…” she says. “Was going to check to see if the Monokuma File was on her monopad, but… she doesn’t remember carrying around another key.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, mystery key,” says Kokichi. “But is the Monokuma File there yet? I want to see! I want to see!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares at him, but she shuffles the strange key back into her pocket and flicks her monopad on. Its screen glows, basking them in light, but instead of the usual opening screen, it merely reads ‘OFFLINE.’ Tenko attempts to switch to a different screen, but the device refuses to respond. “‘Offline?’” she echoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quickly moves to check hers, awkwardly shrugging her backpack off of one shoulder. “Kokichi, check yours, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He does so with little complaint, and after a moment of shuffling things around, Kaede grabs her own to turn it on as well. Hers and Kokichi’s flick to life, displaying the same ‘OFFLINE’ screen as Tenko’s. And there, standing in the dim candle light, Kaede realizes something. “Guys, I think Kokichi was right. Whatever happened to the lights is a lot bigger than we assumed it was. Whatever shut off the lights probably also cut off the body announcement and took the monopads offline.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks absolutely baffled, still swiping at the screen on her monopad. “How is that possible? Was the school struck by lightening or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is a good question,” Kokichi says, and he sends a far too meaningful look to Kaede. “What could take out all the power in the school?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes flicker over to him grinning up at her and then back to her monopad, quickly checking the time. “It’s… almost eight. The power went out about… fifteen or twenty ago, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko believes that is true. Actually,” she finally looks up. “Tenko is a bit worried about how long we’ll have to investigate. The announcement did not finish playing, which means… what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Well, why don’t we ask? Hey, Monokuma!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait a moment but nothing happens. Kaede calls, “Monokuma, we have to ask you something about the school rules!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma does not appear.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts on the spot. “He does not always appear immediately… but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s a chance Monokuma was taken offline, too,” Kaede says. “I don’t—what does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means,” Kokichi says. “The power going out wasn’t the mastermind’s doing. Which means,” his smile turns dark. “Someone else hit the lights.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something about his words makes Kaede uneasy, and she snaps, “We can’t assume that yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko also seems on edge. “Tenko is starting to get worried about the others, especially Himiko.” She holds a hand over her heart. “She was acting strangely when we saw her this morning…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in agreement. “Right, and we still need to find the others anyway—they’re probably as confused as we are. Even if they’re not working, we can still use our monopads as light sources, so walking around in the dark won’t be… an even bigger problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We should split up to find everyone quickly,” Tenko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Ooh, splitting up in the dark when there’s a killer lurking around—that sounds like fun!” He bounces up and down. “Me and Kaede will check the school for everybody!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko curls up her lip at him, but says, “Tenko… does not mind searching outside and the dorms—Himiko may have returned to her room to take a nap, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And seeing if the power’s out at the dorms would help us get a better picture of our situation,” says Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think Tenko cares about that,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” says Kaede, pointedly ignoring him. “Should we…” she sends a hesitant glance to Gonta’s body, “tell everyone to meet here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko grips her monopad a little tighter. “We should tell them what happened. Keeping them in the dark about Gonta… is just too cruel, but maybe a different meeting spot would be better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe the cafeteria?” Kaede suggests. “There might be a portable stove or more candles or something we could use as a better light source, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it is always an excellent place to talk about murder,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko ignores him. “Tenko will tell everyone to meet in the cafeteria then. Ugh,” she shakes her head, a near exhausted look passing over her face. “Tenko would… really like to stop discovering her friends’ bodies…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a sympathetic smile. “Yeah, me too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They split up, Tenko quickly moving ahead of Kaede and Kokichi after waving the former goodbye. Kaede keeps moving through the dark hallway and waits until she hears the sounds of Tenko’s footsteps taking the stairs two at a time fade into the distance. Then, she says, “Kokichi, did you know the blackout was going to happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums, holding the glowing monopad under his face to cause shadows to leap dramatically over his pale face. “Of course—I know everything, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes. “Tell me the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t like yes as the truth, but what about no?” Kokichi asks. “So nope—I’m as in the dark about the power as you are!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her patience draining rapidly. “A straight answer, please.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pouts. “But I just gave you two straight answers, and you didn’t like either one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” she says. “This is really not the time for your games. Also,” she jerks her hand suddenly, causing Kokichi to stumble slightly. “Why on earth did you do this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His carefree expression changes to something dark, the shadows clinging to his face doing nothing to help. “I already told you—I did it to be safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that even mean?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means I don’t trust you,” Kokichi says flatly. “Now isn’t that a nice straight answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk through the pitch blackness stretching out ahead in angry silence before finally making it to the stairs leading down from the fourth floor. Kaede pauses. With her irritation with Kokichi at an all time high, she says, “Wait—I need to put my monopad away so at least one of us can hold onto the railing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi remains silent as she shuffles her backpack around, slipping her monopad back inside. She snaps it shut and he finally says, “So does that mean I’m in charge of our light source now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” she answers, straightening her backpack. “Just hold it straight, at least while we’re walking down stairs, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got it, boss,” he says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs, but Kokichi does as he’s told as they move at a crawl down the stairs, Kaede near desperate to prevent either of them from tripping and taking the other down with them. Kokichi doesn’t seem nearly as bothered and practically skips from step to step, the light from his monopad bouncing with each step.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It takes entirely too long, and Kaede breathes out a sigh of relief when they reach the third floor. At the foot of the stairs, Kaede places one hand over her heart while Kokichi examines his monopad commenting, “Sure is nice the clock still works even when everything else is broken. That way we’ll know how much time we have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks over to him, furrowing her brow. “Time until what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “C’mon, Kaede, I can’t give you all the answers. Besides, it’d be just silly for me to tell someone like you all the answers.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t like me,” Kaede says. “I get it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, you don’t,” he answers. “But that’s fine. Also,” he points at her with his handcuffed hand, “If I were you, I wouldn’t try to kill me now—it’d be too obvious, and that wouldn’t be entertaining for anyone, and you can’t have that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at him in pure shock for a moment. “Wha-What on earth are you talking about!?” she says, voice rising in volume out of sheer surprise. “I-I’m not—I would <i>never</i> kill anyone!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And though she’s all too aware of the blatant falseness in her words, in her reeling state, they ring true within the tight confines of the hallway.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stops walking. He stares up at her blank faced. His normally childish voice turns harsh, and he practically hisses, “Don’t lie to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He moves forward against, sharply jerking her forward with him, the metal of the cuffs biting into her wrist.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds her pace in time with his and shifts her tone to match the cruelty of his. “I didn’t. I’ve made enough mistakes already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t reply, and they reach the stairs down to the second floor in an even worse place than when they descended the first steps at a snail’s pace. No words pass between them this time, and Kaede feels along the wall to keep them steady while the earlier cheer in Kokichi’s footsteps disappears completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On the second floor, two similar blue glows stand like beacons in the darkness, and Kaede makes out Tsumugi’s face illuminated over her monopad before the other girl calls out, “Ah, who’s there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s me,” says Kaede. “And Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, thank goodness,” Tsumugi says, her light bouncing over to them with each step. “I-I heard the body announcement begin to play, and I started to get really worried.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The second, closer to the ground light move slower, but with an aching sense of dread, Kaede realizes its Ryoma. Her stomach twists into knots when he says, “Think Tenko came speeding past up earlier, so she’s accounted for, too, then. Haven’t seen anyone else yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods hurriedly. “That’s right—and moving around in the dark like this is plainly terrifying, so I’m just happy I was able to find Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede absently hears her words move around, but her focus remains on Ryoma and she’s possibly supposed to tell him what she discovered. “Y-Yeah,” she says. “Ah, um, what are you guys doing up here anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma answers first. “I was supposed to meet Gonta to talk about something in his lab—he hasn’t showed yet though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede flinches at his reply, but it goes unnoticed as Tsumugi begins rattling off her answer. “I was actually going to try and do some laundry in Kirumi’s lab, but when the lights turned off, I screamed, and Ryoma found me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… I see,” Kaede says. She takes a deep breath and is endlessly thankful that Kokichi has decided to keep his mouth shut during this entire exchange. “Ryoma, there’s something I need to tell you. The body announcement started to play because… we…” she takes another breath, “We found Gonta’s body on the fourth floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t react to her words immediately, simply freezing in place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “I am so sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps and presses a hand over her mouth. “Oh, no,” she says. “Oh, no. H-How—?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Kaede says. “I investigated a little, but with the power going out—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where is he?” Ryoma asks, voice near emotionless.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fourth floor, middle of the three rooms,” Kokichi answers immediately. “It’s locked, but Tenko has the key.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “I’m going there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He already begins to move past them, and Kaede calls out, “But, Ryoma, the door’s locked!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll break it down,” he answers in the same dead voice. He rounds the corner away from them, and the light surrounding him disappears completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares after him, half debating following him when she hears Tsumugi say, “Gonta… how could anyone kill someone like him? Did one of us really…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” says Kokichi. “Otherwise it wouldn’t be much of a game we’re playing, now would it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s awful!” Tsumugi says. “You’re awful! You’re…” she trails off, staring at the two of them curiously. “Are you two handcuffed together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a sudden flash of embarrassment. “Uh, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh,” she says. “Um, why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was not my choice,” Kaede says flatly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was a matter of fate,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was not,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks between them confusedly. “Um, well, that aside, I suppose I should try to do something useful, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Yeah. Right now I’m just trying to find everyone… and tell them the news. I figured we could meet in the cafeteria instead of… at Gonta’s body, but Ryoma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think we should let Ryoma do what he wants right now,” Tsumugi says. “Ugh, this is all so horrible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Leaving a suspect alone with the body to destroy evidence is horrible,” Kokichi says, puffing his cheeks out. “Totally ruins the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stares at him in horror. “Wha-What? There’s no way Ryoma is a suspect! He would never hurt Gonta!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “And also, Tsumugi, you should probably ignore Kokichi. He seems determined to be extra awful today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins up at her, and Tsumugi sends him a wary look. “That still doesn’t sound very good, but,” she turns back to Kaede. “I’ll try and go tell Ryoma about meeting in the cafeteria, and then I’ll be right there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods at her, and Tsumugi waves them goodbye before shuffling off into the dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone again, Kaede sighs, and glances down to see Kokichi checking the time on his monopad again. She looks over his shoulder. “Are you going to tell me when you keep looking at that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” he says. “But I’m sure you’ll figure it out. Now, c’mon—we need to go see everyone else!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to tug her along down the halls, finding each one ahead of them eerily empty and even more eerily silent. Kaede doesn’t actively recall an abundance of ambient noises humming around the school, but something about the oppressive darkness drowns out nearly everything besides her own clicking footsteps. Kokichi doesn’t seem disturbed, and returns to his previous jocular skipping, though he appears to have no intention of making further conversation with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They circle the second floor, and Kaede makes a point to check the cafeteria to see if Tenko managed to direct anyone there. Kokichi casts the light of his monopad over the empty room just in case anyone opted to sit in the dark, and Kaede sighs. Back in the hallway again, Kaede almost absently glances out one of the windows, and it takes her a moment to recognize how strange the sight before her is.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” she says, coming to a standstill. “Why is it also dark outside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stands on his toes to peek out the window as well and into the pitch blackness below. “Hmm,” he says. “Now that is strange.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The confusion rings heavy in her mind. “B-But it was sunny outside this morning,” Kaede says. “And it’s <i>still</i> morning. And even when it’s night, it’s usually bright enough to still make your way around…” she shakes her head. “What on earth is happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi is silent for a moment, staring hard at the strange night sky. Then he suggests almost conversationally, “Maybe the sky turned off.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede snaps. “If you’re not going to give me a real answer, could you just be quiet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was a real answer,” he says, eyes fixed on the window. “But,” he turns back to her with a dark smile. “I’ll be quiet if you don’t want to hear it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw and pulls him along, jerking him a touch too roughly on her first steps away from the window.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">On the first floor, Kaede stops dead in her tracks as a near blinding light rounds the corner towards them. She shields her eyes with her free hand, and a familiar cheery voice calls out, “Kiibo, look! Kaede and Kokichi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks against the harsh light and says, “Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie skips towards her, perfectly silhouetted in the odd halo of light. “Kaede,” she says. “There you are! Angie’s been looking for everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squints, attempting to make out her beaming expression even as the blinding light moves closer. “Yeah, I’ve been looking for everyone, too. But, Angie, what is that light?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Angie. “That’s just Kiibo. God must have told Miu all the lights would go out because she gave Kiibo these super amazing flashlight eyes!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” Kiibo’s voice says somewhere in distant. “Though I am unsure if Miu was aware what would happen, her foresight is undeniably of great aid for our current situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “First I couldn’t see because it was dark, and now I can’t see because Kiiboy and the pig are trying to blind me with their useless inventions…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My upgrades are incredibly useful!” Kiibo argues back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede decides to put a stop to their bickering. “Anyway,” she says. “Have either of you seen anyone else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie taps a finger to her chin. “Hmm, Angie saw Himiko early this morning before God decided to turn off all the lights.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Before the blackout,” Kiibo says. “I saw Kaito and Maki in the dorms, however,” though Kaede cannot see his face, a noticeable edge of worry creeps into his voice. “That was because I was attempting to greet Miu this morning. She… she did not answer her door when I called for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Angie. “And so God told Angie that she should help Kiibo look for Miu—Angie wants to keep all her student council members safe.” She grins at Kaede, and then says. “Also, Kaede, why are you and Kokichi handcuffed together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede groans. “It’s… not important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “So, instead of talking about super boring, I’ll just cut right to the chase. We haven’t see Miu all day! But, don’t worry Kiiboy, the body announcement wasn’t for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The worry in Kiibo’s voice only increases. “You… Was someone killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh no!” says Angie. “Kokichi, did you already see the body? Who was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede decides to deliver the news before Kokichi gets the chance. “Gonta,” she says too quickly. “Ah, I mean… we discovered Gonta’s body on the fourth floor this morning, right before the lights went out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So someone was killed,” Kiibo says solemnly. “And logically… Gonta’s killer is one of us. Also, if you will excuse me for saying this, I… I am even more worried for Miu now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kiibo,” Angie says. “God says Miu will totally be okay as long as we pray for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yes,” Kiibo says. “Right now I want to believe she is alright and that nothing has happened to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” asks Kokichi. “Just because she’s missing and everything’s dark and there’s a killer running around somewhere?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stutters for a moment. “I-I still wish to believe she is alright. Ah, perhaps I should continue my search then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We already searched the upper floors,” Kaede says. “And I’m afraid we didn’t see her… sorry, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I will check outside or the basement,” he says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, God says that’s a great plan,” says Angie. “So, Kiibo can search outside or at Miu’s lab or something, and Kaede and Kokichi can check the basement!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What about you?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie will come to the basement a few steps behind you guys,” Angie answers. “God says that’s the best way to do things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t protest, but in the even eerier basement with Angie noticeably a few paces back, she can’t help but sigh in frustration at Angie’s obvious attempt to make them walk into danger first. They find the basement empty, even when Kaede forces them briefly to stop at the library to examine the hidden door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie flutters around the room, and Kaede glares at the bookshelf concealing the path to the mastermind’s lair.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rocks back and forth on his heels and mumbles under his breath, “they always return to the scene of the crime…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just sighs. Louder, so Angie can hear, she says, “I suppose without the power, this door is probably even more impenetrable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Hmm, God says we should leave here.” She skips over to Kaede. “He also says we’ve been wandering around in the dark for forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kokichi looking at the clock on his monopad once again. “Just an hour and a half.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “Is that important?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” he says. “But we should really go back to the second floor.” He begins to try and walk away, tugging on Kaede’s arm as he does so. “C’mon, Kaede-chan!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stands firm. “Kokichi,” Kaede says, “I’m not going anywhere until you tell me what you know about what’s happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to sniffle. “I already said I didn’t know anything… You’re so mean, Kaede, suspecting me of keeping secrets…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head one way. “Oh? Does Kokichi know something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi brings both of his hands to his heart, pulling one of Kaede’s with him. “I just know that it’s dark, and I am a frightened child. I don’t understand why you’re trying to keep us in this weird creepy room where my poor beloved Rantaro died… Unless,” he grins. “You think it’s Rantaro’s ghost that’s causing the power outage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “Ah! Maybe Rantaro’s ghost is already here waiting for the ritual to start!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “Kokichi, just tell me why the time is important, and stop pretending it’s not. You’ve been checking your monopad for it every ten minutes, and I refuse to leave this room until you tell me why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pauses for a moment, going blank faced as he stares back up at her glare. Then he examines the nails on his hand. “Fine. The blackout started about twenty minutes before eight this morning. It will end at nine-forty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-How do you know that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie,” Kokichi says suddenly. “Were you and Kiiboy together all morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, nope!” Angie says. “Angie saw Himiko this morning, but other than that she was by herself when God turned off all the lights. God only guided Angie to Kiibo later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares at her. “Well,” he says blandly. “That’s frustrating.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi says. “Were you listening in on my conversation with Angie? That’s so rude, Kaede! And c’mon! I answered all your dumb questions, so let’s go to the second floor already!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins tugging at her arm again, and Kaede tiredly allows herself to be pulled along. “Why do you want to go to the second floor so badly?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I want to meet with everyone in the cafeteria!” he says. “Jeeze, Kaede, this was your stupid plan in the first place!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh!” Angie clasps her hands together. “Are we going to eat breakfast now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re just trying to meet with the others, Angie,” Kaede says, glancing back to her even as Kokichi pulls on her arm like a tiny dog on a leash.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, God says that’s a great idea,” she answers and skips along behind them without protest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The entire trip back, Kokichi keeps staring at the clock on his monopad, and Kaede notices that the closer the time he predicted the black out to end approaches, the more he yanks on her arm to move faster, almost as if he was anxious about something. When the reach the second floor, Kokichi immediately announces they should search around it to see if anyone decided to hide around any corners to jump out at them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes at the suggestion, and says, “Why don’t we check the cafeteria first, and then we can run around aimlessly?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “Fiiine. We have five minutes before the power comes back on, so be fast!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Angie ask, “Why would we have to be fast? God says all the lights coming back on is a good thing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t answer and remains oddly silent as they make their way to the cafeteria without seeing a single other person. Kaede spares a glance down at him, and if he was anyone else, she would say he seemed nervous.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Like clockwork, at nine-forty, a low humming noise begins to echo around the hall. Kaede stops moving. “What is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps trying to move forward. “The power coming back on—I already told you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, all at once, the lights in the hall begin to flicker back on, and Kaede whips her head to peer out a window, seeing the sky suddenly shining blue again. Angie gasps. “Angie knew God would come help us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares out the window curiously. “Maybe…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The speakers begin to crackle to life above them. “—vered. After a certain amount of time has passed, the class trial will begin!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The body announcement…” Kaede mumbles. “We… should still go see if anyone’s waiting in the cafeteria.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk the last few remaining steps ahead of them, and Kaede pushes the doors open and screams. Angie hurries to move around them, and gasps, bringing her hands to her mouth.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For the second time that day, the speakers flick to life, announcing, “A body has been discovered!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s noise plays idly in the distance as Kaede stares in horror at Himiko’s small body lying completely motionless on top of the table, her head lolled towards them to see her eyes squeezed shut and bright red marks circling her neck.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sprints to her, Kokichi tripping slightly over his feet to keep up. “Oh God…” Kaede breathes. “Himiko… oh God…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, Angie just saw her this morning!” Angie says, quickly moving around the table to reach Himiko’s other side. “Himiko was totally fine this morning!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares completely emotionlessly down at her corpse. Over the sounds of Kaede’s racing mind, she hears him mutter under his breath, “looks like I was wrong…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before she can question him, Angie says, “God says we need to find everyone and tell them what happened so we can find Himiko’s killer.” She reaches out and grips one of Himiko’s tiny pale hands. “Angie will pray super extra hard for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That… sounds like a good idea, Angie…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t notice the way Kokichi clenches and unclenches his fists, nails biting into his palms hard enough to draw blood.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others come. First Tsumugi who tells them that Ryoma has no intentions of leaving Gonta’s body. Then the other four all come together as a group after their exploration of outside. Kaede knew it would happen, but she still had no way of possibly preparing herself for Tenko’s reaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bodily pushes past the others, screaming for Himiko as she sprints to her side. She reaches her tiny body, Angie still sitting at her side, and Tenko’s entire body seems to seize up and she clutches at the sides of her head, shaking it back and forth as tears begin to pour down her face. Kaede comes behind her and gently places a hand on her back as Tenko’s shoulders begin to shake under the strength of her sobs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind them, Kaito curses. “Damnit. How… how the fuck could anyone do this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was one of us,” Kokichi says dully. “Or, maybe two of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito takes a step towards him. “What the hell does that mean!? I am not in the mood for fucking games, you little—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He means,” Maki says. “There were two murders. There could be two killers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi wrings her hands. “Can that happen? What do we do if… someone else killed Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the mention of her name, Tenko begins crying even harder.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps rubbing her back and says, “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma chooses that moment to appear. “I’m glad you all asked!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the sound of his voice, Tenko whips her head to him. Her voice is the angriest Kaede has ever heard it. “Get out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, is that anyway to treat someone who just wants to tell you about our very special double murder rule?” Monokuma asks. “Because here at—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said leave!” Tenko shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito says, coming to stand between her and Monokuma. “I know you’re pissed off—no one here fucking blames you either, but we need to hear what he has to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you do!” Monokuma says. “Because see, all little old me wanted to say is that when someone decides to try and graduate, and then <i>someone else</i> tries to graduate right afterwards, it’s first come first served!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence falls over them, and Angie says, “Angie saw Himiko this morning… so Gonta was probably killed first…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup, yup!” says Monokuma. “And that means death number two doesn’t matter! Doesn’t mean a thing! Diddly squat!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rushes for him at that point, and Kaito quickly lunges to grab her around the waist, preventing her from striking the now laughing Monokuma in the face. Through gritted teeth, Kaito says, “Tenko! Calm the hell down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let go of me!” she screams, thrashing in his grip. “Let go—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Standing near them, Kaede sees Tenko thrust her elbow back into his stomach with far more force than either of them were expecting. Kaito lets out a strangled sounding gasp, and releases her immediately, stumbling backwards and falling onto his hands and knees, with one hand clutching his stomach.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The movement distracts Tenko from Monokuma, who takes the opportunity to disappear. She says, “M-Kaito?” and in front of everyone he lets out a hacking cough and blood splatters on the ground below him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki moves to kneel at his side as he keeps coughing, near desperately struggling to get his breathing back under control. More blood drips from his mouth to the floor below. They all stand around him, silent except for the sound of Kaito’s haggard gasping echoing around the room. Between coughs, he wheezes out, “I’m… I’m fine… I’m…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki moves to loop one of his arms over her shoulders. “I’ll take him back to his room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he pants. “I need… I need to fucking… fucking investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at them with a grim expression. She doesn’t trust Maki, but from the conversation between them she had overheard, she knows the other girl wouldn’t hurt him. At least, she sincerely hopes so. “Okay,” Kaede says. “I’ll come by to check on you later.” Kaito looks up at her, blood streaking down from his mouth and he’s about to protest when Kaede says, “And fill you in on everything I find.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He debates this for a moment then squeezes his eyes shut. “Fine… I’ll be ready for the trial… I just need to fucking…” he looks to Maki. “Lie down or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You do,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two of them begin to limp out of the room, and right before they reach the doors, Tenko calls out, “Tenko is sorry! She didn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t apologize,” Kaito says, spiting more blood at the ground. “Not your fucking fault. Just,” and with blood pooling between his teeth he tries to grin at her, “do your best and fuck up the killer, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods wordlessly, and the doors behind them swing shut.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">More silence follows, and Kiibo clears his throat. “Perhaps now is a bad time to mention this, but… I still have not found Miu. I,” he glances to Himiko’s body, “I am beginning to become very worried about her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi waves a hand. “She’ll turn up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-How can you just say that so casually?” Tsumugi asks. “After… after what happened here, Miu could be—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Excuse me everyone,” Kiibo says hurriedly, Tsumugi’s comment clearly triggering something in him. “But I think I am going to keep looking for Miu. If I find anything while I search, I will be sure to report back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, he rushes out of the room, and Kaede distantly hears him calling out Miu’s name as he runs down the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says, hugging one of her arms. “Maybe I shouldn’t have said that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “It’s alright. Besides, finding Miu is still important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “Does that mean we’re the only ones investigating?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances around. “It sure looks that way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Angie says. “God says we should start with the Monokuma Files.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “Kokichi, let me see yours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns at her but complies. “We should start with Himiko since she’s here,” Kokichi says as he pulls up her file.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins reading it. The victim was Himiko Yumeno, Ultimate Magician. She was killed at some point between 7:40 and 9:40 this morning, and her body was discovered in the cafeteria. The cause of death was asphyxiation, likely strangulation due to the wounds around her neck, which indicate an object such as a rope was used. There are no other external injuries.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a breath and looks up at the others. “We can look at Gonta’s file later,” she turns to Himiko’s body. “Right now… we should investigate around here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says. “Um, didn’t Monokuma say we only need to investigate the first death? A-And, um,” she flicks through to Gonta’s file anyway, despite Kaede’s earlier directions. “The Monokuma File says Gonta was killed at around midnight last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at her, and then turns to Tenko’s grim face, still streaked with tears. “We should still investigate here. We need to find out what happened to Himiko, even if… she was killed by someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “That’s right! God says we need to find Himiko’s killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kokichi says. “I think it’s safe to say Himiko was moved here after she was killed, so the only thing to investigate here is her body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says in a choked voice, “How do you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because,” he answers plainly, all of his previous mischievous energy gone. “Kaede and I were in the school the whole time. With Kaede’s hearing, she would have heard if there was a struggle or if Himiko screamed for help. The most likely scenario is someone killed her in a secret place and then moved her here to be discovered.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Angie says. “We were in the basement for a while. God doesn’t know if Kaede could hear something happening on the second floor while we were down there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at him. “Kokichi and I have airtight alibis,” Kaede says raising her handcuffed arm. “We were together the entire time with no way to separate, so I don’t think he has a reason to lie right now, but, Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can accuse me at the trial if you want to,” Kokichi says casually. “Right now we need to investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He takes a step towards Himiko’s corpse, and Tenko immediately moves in front of him. “Tenko will examine her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi raises his hands in surrender. “The body is yours, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares down at him for a few more moments before taking a deep breath and moving to lean over Himiko’s body. Kaede hears her whisper, “Tenko is sorry, Himiko… Tenko couldn’t protect you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She removes Himiko’s witch hat and pushes back her short hair slightly to get a better view of the angry red markings cutting into her neck. Kaede moves to stand next to her as Tenko carefully moves her hands over her neck. “Tenko thinks,” she says after a moment. “That whatever the killer used was probably rougher and thicker than a rope, like,” Tenko lets out a sigh and her voice breaks over her next words, “l-like a metal w-wire o-or—” she covers her mouth with one of her hands, heavy sobs coming over her anew. “T-Tenko is s-sorry, b-but she c-can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay,” Kaede says gently. “I don’t think there’s much to investigate here anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, still trying to calm herself down as she rubs at her fresh tears.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stands silently next to her, and he says, “Her ear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes dart to him, and then to where his eyes are trained at a spot of dried blood just behind Himiko’s right ear. “You’re right,” Kaede says, brushing more of her hair out of the way to get a better look. “There’s blood here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” says Angie. “Angie thought the Monokuma File said there were no other injuries, and her neck doesn’t look bloody.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kaede. “It doesn’t. So the question is why is this here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s a mystery,” Kokichi says. “Buuut, Kaede and I should go investigate Gonta’s corpse now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede says as he starts trying to head out the door. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because there are three people here who can handle it! Duh!” Kokichi says. “Aaaand, we’re on a time limit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him, but Tenko’s hoarse voice says, “Go. Tenko… wants to stay here anyway. She’ll tell you if she finds anything else…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns back to give her a sympathetic look, and Tsumugi says, “I can stay here, too, to look around. I’ve also… already seen Gonta’s body…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie hasn’t,” Angie says. “God’s wondering if Angie should take a look then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pulls a face, and Kaede says, “If you want to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie jumps up from the table. “Okay, Angie will come, too, and she’ll spend the entire time praying for Himiko and Gonta!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds like a nice idea, Angie,” Kaede says, and the three of them wander back out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the darkness gone, Angie skips ahead easily, and Kokichi mutters, “You know, it’s hard to tell if you actually want to know what I have to say or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lowers her voice and keeps her eyes on Angie as she says, “So you feel like talking now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi goes silent for a moment. Then, “I guessed wrong. And now I’m going to make up for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods, looking straight ahead. “We’ll find Miu, soon. If you talk to her, you’ll figure it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede attempts to engage him a few more times, but he remains tightlipped the entire way back up to the fourth floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They reach the three rooms, and Kaede sees the door to the middle one has been bodily removed from its hinges, lying flatly out in the center of the hallway. She grimaces at it, as Angie daintily steps over it to peer inside. Her eyes immediately widen, and she rushes in. Kaede hears her call, “What happened to Angie’s statues!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to go after her, when she sees something odd out of the corner of her eye. With a frown, she approaches the far door where the ritual was supposed to take place, and sees what appears to be the mechanism for a second one of Miu’s locks placed on it. She kneels down and runs her fingers over it. “When did Miu put this here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands and tries to open the door to little avail. “Kokichi, could you try picking this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, and examines it, tilting his head one way and then the other. “Hmm, looks like one of the locks can only be opened from the outside and one from the inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Why would there be one that can only be opened from the inside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “It’s a mystery. I guess you’ll have to ask Miu. Ah, speaking of which…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his words, Kaede turns to see Kiibo jogging towards them from down the hall. “Kaede,” he says. “I have searched everywhere, and I still have not been able to find Miu—have you seen her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares down at Kokichi as she says, “No, I haven’t. But, Kiibo, I have a feeling you should investigate this room with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stares at her openmouthed for a moment. “I know I have not been investigating, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay,” Kaede says. “I just think this room might tell us something about what happened to Miu, and,” she moves to glance inside and makes out Ryoma motionlessly sitting in front of Gonta’s body now positioned to lie down on the ground. “And… we need to search here anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo follows her gaze and nods. “I will do my best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a grim determination propelling her forward, Kaede steps inside and notices Angie fluttering back and forth to each of her statues, mumbling about how someone could possibly deface them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede kneels down next to Ryoma who just sits, silently staring at Gonta’s face. She clears her throat. “Ryoma,” she says. “Did you, ah, have you found anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He remains quiet a moment longer and says in a low voice, “Haven’t been looking. Just moved his body out of that horrible thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I see,” Kaede says. “Ah, I’m not sure if you know, but, um, Himiko… was also killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes another long pause. Then, “Poor Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right,” Kaede stutters, and she begins to move back to her feet, when Ryoma fishes something out of his pocket and holds it up to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Found this in his pocket when I was moving him,” Ryoma says, eyes not moving from Gonta’s body. “It’s a note—probably from the killer. I don’t want to look at it anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods tightly and gently takes it from his grasp. She unfolds the piece of paper and holds it down lower to stop Kokichi from jumping up and down to try and read it. It appears to be a piece of computer paper and in printed letters it reads, “Come to the fourth floor at midnight or Ryoma will be killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her chest tighten, and she looks back down to Ryoma still sitting motionless. She reads it again, eyes running over the words but barely processing them. The note catches her so thoroughly off guard that she only realizes Kokichi has taken out his monopad to pull up Gonta’s file when he shoves it into her face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, right,” she says and begins to read it. The victim was Gonta Gokuhara, the Ultimate Entomologist. His time of death was approximately midnight last night. His cause of death was a stab wound through his chest going all the way through one side and out the other. There are no other external wounds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reads it over again then gestures for Kokichi to move slightly away from Ryoma and towards Kiibo and Angie inspecting Rantaro’s statue in one of the far corners. When she approaches them, she lowers her voice, and says, “The Monokuma File said Gonta was stabbed with a sword that went all the way through him. Are Himiko’s swords long enough to do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo places a hand to his chin in thought. Angie continues trying to pull the sword lodged in Rantaro’s chest free. “They are certainly long enough to go through one of Angie’s statues,” he answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede answers. “And they’re also supposed to stretch the entire distance of the box… which is where we found him…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “It sounds like one of the swords is likely the murder weapon, then. However, none of the ones on the ground appear to be bloody, so,” he turns to Angie. “Angie and I are attempting to see if the killer tried to hide the murder weapon in one of her statues.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie doesn’t understand why the killer would do that, though,” she says. “Especially since Angie was just gonna pull them out anyway!” She gives it another yank, and it comes free, leaving a rather wide hole in Rantaro’s stomach. She examines it for a moment before letting it clamor to the ground and huffing. “Angie doesn’t even know why her statues are here! She thought she placed them in the other room yesterday, and—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her face freezes as she begins hurriedly shoving her hands in her pockets, likely grasping around for something. Kiibo asks, “Is something the matter, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie’s keys are missing!” she announces, pulling her pockets out to turn them inside out. “Angie had the key for her lab and for the room for the ritual.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And they’re both gone?” Kaede asks. “When did your keys—” she cuts herself off as she remembers something that happened in that room only a few hours ago. “W-Why don’t we investigate something else for now, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie huffs. “But Angie needs the key to her lab so she can repair her statues!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede internally questions if now is the best time for that, but she says, “Angie, I’m going to take another look at this sword, if that’s alright.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie shrugs. “If Kaede thinks it’s important, God says she should do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and plucks it from the ground, weighing the thick blade in her hands. She glances around again, spying the statues of Kirumi and Korekiyo in similar positions to Rantaro’s. “Kiibo, could you investigate Korekiyo’s statue? And Angie, would you mind taking a look at Kirumi’s?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi bounces up and down. “Are we going to investigate Shuichi’s?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw. “I was planning on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” he says, immediately moving to pull her over to it. “Let’s see if there are any weird fun secrets with it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as Kokichi tugs her towards the one statue without a sword in it, and Kaede internally curses that is just had to be Shuichi’s statue that she’d need to thoroughly examine. She walks around it, seeing no places where it appears anything was stabbed through or any other puncture marks. Kaede steps back from it, eyes grazing over it from the all too familiar hat sitting atop its head to its feet, and she pauses, narrowing her eyes, as she spies the traces of something gold and shiny on the side of one of his feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s about to reach out to examine it more when she hears Angie call, “Okay, Angie and Kiibo are done!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Kiibo. “And in my search, I can conclude that Korekiyo’s statue is exactly the same as Rantaro’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Okay,” says Kaede, hurrying over to them. “Um, Shuichi’s statue…” she looks over Kiibo and Angie’s expectant faces and feels Kokichi lightly tug on her arm and she makes a decision. “It seems, his was untouched. I don’t know why, but the killer didn’t seem to mess with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is strange,” Kiibo says, crossing his arms. “Is there a reason why the killer would do a thing like this in the first place, or was it just to distract us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie puffs out her cheeks. “Angie just wants to know who messed with her art.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll probably find the answer to that later,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weeeeell,” Kokichi drawls. “Did anybody find anything else? Anybody metal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I… did actually discover something else suspicious, yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “You did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yes, while I was walking towards Korekiyo’s statue, I noticed the floor seemed even more unstable. I—I actually almost fell through at one point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” says Kaede. “Can you show me where?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods again and gingerly walks a few paces towards the wall dividing them between their room and the ritual room. “About here, I felt the floorboards were not as stable, and I made an effort to move more carefully.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s strange,” Kaede says. “I was here for a long time yesterday, and I don’t remember anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe that’s because,” Kokichi says dramatically and he leans down, squeezing his fingers around the side of one of the floorboards and lifting it up. “Someone broke the floor!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at him in shock.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “How did you know that Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How—why would someone do that?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi lets it fall with a clatter next to him. “It’s a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo kneels over the new opening. “It appears very dark down here,” he begins to say. “However there is quite a bit of room, and—Miu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his sudden shout he scrambles to rip another board out of place that comes easily enough in his grip. Kiibo’s flashlight eyes roar on, and after squinting against the light, Kaede firmly makes out a figure in a familiar pink dress lying face down under the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo directs his illuminating gaze downwards, and Kaede spies the even more horrifying sight of what is distinctly a pool of dried blood below them. Kiibo moves fast, and after Kaede centers herself again, she moves after him, gingerly stepping down into the sticky splotches of blood below them, before forcing herself to crawl to keep up with Kiibo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems half annoyed, but moves along easily enough with her as they approach Kiibo, moving to cradle Miu’s body. “Miu,” he says jostling her slightly. “Miu, please wake up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For a moment the same sense of dread that Kaede had felt so strongly before overtakes her, and she feels her chest seize up again, as Kiibo continues to desperately shake Miu’s body. He continues to call her name, and Kaede gently says, “Kiibo, I think…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo presses her closer to him, bowing his head over her. “Please do not say it, Kaede. I know… what has happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods grimly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi yawns. “Please, Kiiboy, stop crying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede snaps. “How can you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Easy,” he says. “The body announcement hasn’t gone off. Look, the pig’s moving already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo and Kaede both freeze and slowly look down at Miu shifting slightly in Kiibo’s arms. Kiibo looks at her in awe. “Miu…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shifts a bit more, groaning as she does so, “Ugh, what the fuck is…” Miu’s eyelashes flicker and she groggily reaches up to begin rubbing at her eyes. “Fucking… terrible place for a nap,” she mutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You… were sleeping?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Miu looks up at her. “What are you doing here, whale-tits? And—” she seems to notice all at once that she’s being held in Kiibo’s arms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her entire face flushes pink, and Kiibo reaches out to press a hand to her forehead in worry. “Miu, you’re burning up! A-And you appear to be uncontrollably drooling.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Told you she was fine,” Kokichi says in a sing song voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his words, Miu’s head snaps to him, and she dramatically flails her arms to jab a finger inches from his face. “You little cocksucking shitstain!” she screeches. “This is all your fault!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between them. “What’s his fault?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The reason why I’m taking a goddamn nap in this goddamn hell pit!” Miu shouts. “That little prick locked me in here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Kiibo both turn to Kokichi who innocently places a finger on his chin. “Huh? Did I forget to mention that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins to scream obscenities, and Kaede rests back on her heels, staring openmouthed at Kokichi, even more confused about the case than before they started their investigation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the start, I kind of knew the investigation would take two chapters, so next chapter will ideally be the rest of the investigation and hopefully part of the trial. Also double murder, because what's chapter 3 without one?</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—and shove it up your fucking boney ass!” Miu screams at a rather bored looking Kokichi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She keeps going, and Kaede opts to raise her voice over Miu’s din of vulgarities, shouting, “Miu! Stop yelling! Just tell us what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo chimes in. “Yes. Though I understand you are angry at Kokichi, it would be best for everyone if you could work out your problems with him at a different time.” His face turns grim as he shares a look with Kaede. “We are unfortunately on a time limit, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Yeah, I’ll fucking sort something out with the little piece of shit later. Also,” she turns to Kiibo. “The fuck are we on a time limit for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “You don’t know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No?” Miu says. “I’ve been stuck in this hellpit since last night—I don’t know shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Last night?’” Kiibo echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “When did you trap Miu down here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “Weeeell, I wouldn’t say ‘trap,’ and I wouldn’t say ‘down here,’ buuuuut,” he taps a finger to his chin. “Think it was one in the morning or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does that sound right?” Kaede asks Miu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns but nods. “Yeah. Did none of you assholes notice I was missing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiiboy did,” says Kokichi. “But no one else really cared, so I really don’t think it’s a big deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu seems on the verge of going on another tirade, so Kaede preempts her with, “<i>Anyway</i>, Miu, can you give us the full story about what happened to you? It might be really important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu crosses her arms and settles herself more comfortably in Kiibo’s arms to his mild confusion. “Alright, so last night, I’m just working in my lab—minding my own damn business—when small, pasty, and ugly came banging on my door. He told me Angie let him into the student council, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo interrupts, asking, “Is that true, Kokichi? I thought you said you had no intentions of joining the student council.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nods eagerly. “Yup! It was a lie, but Miu didn’t think twice, right Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls at him. “I’m gonna fucking bash your skull in one of these days.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like to see you try, pig,” he says, grinning widely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, Kokichi lied about being on the student council,” Kaede says, “and what happened next?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu keeps glaring but continues her story. “Next,” she says, “he started going on and on about how apparently Angie needed another fucking lock installed on the fourth floor. I already had a couple extras made, ‘cause I’m prepared as shit, so I went up to the goddamn fourth floor, and the door to this room was open, so I fucking start—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “‘The door to this room?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “Room for the weird ass fucking ritual, so anyway—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kiibo says. “We are currently under the floor in the middle room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu blinks. “No,” she says slowly. “We’re like, between the fuckers.” She points up at a particularly thick bored suspended above them. “Bam—motherfucking support beam. I had to crawl on my goddamn hands and knees to get here. And not in a fun way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then you took a nap?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well,” Miu stutters. “I-I was really tired you know? And it was nice and dark and warm down here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi waves a hand. “Doesn’t matter—pigs are used to sleeping in dirt. So what happened next Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Go fuck yourself with a spiked dildo,” she spits before jabbing a finger at the handcuffs still securely around his and Kaede’s wrists. “Stop kinkshaming me when you’re fucking parading around your bondage fetish!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sputters, “It-It absolutely is nothing like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kokichi agrees. “I’m not interested in Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s relief, Kiibo says, “Miu could you tell us what happened next? We still only have so much time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes. “Fine. So I’m there, and I’m, like, half inside the room or whatever to install it, and when I finished, I stand up and ask the little twink if Angie wanted anymore shit, and then! Then!” she thrusts a finger in his again. “He fucking elbows me in the ribs and shoves me in here and locked me the fuck in! <i>And</i> all of the candles were blown out so it was darker than Satan’s asshole!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s what happened!” Kokichi cheers. “So story time with Miu is over now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede ignores him. “So you were here all night? And how did you get under the floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu tosses some of her hair over her shoulder. “You bet your ass I was. And after screaming for help didn’t work ‘cause everyone here is a big, fat whale dick, I took a nap for a while. On escape attempt, two, I started groping around in the dark and found some of the floorboards were loose. Shota must have sawed out the supports or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then she crawled under here and fell asleep again and didn’t notice the blood only a few feet from her,” Kokichi says. “Can we get back to investigating now? Listening to Miu is so boring…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu blinks. “‘Blood?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Miu,” Kiibo says. “While you were asleep… Gonta and Himiko were killed. We were investigating the crime scene when we found you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kokichi chirps. “Gonta was already dead by the time Miu got here.” He turns his monopad to the group. “Time of death is midnight, meaning Miu was next to a dead body this whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees all the color drain from Miu’s face as the other girl goes a near deathly shade of white. “Wh-Wh-<i>WHAT</i>!?” she shrieks, voice piercing. Miu immediately begins to thrash in Kiibo’s arms, “Get me out of here! Get me the <i>fuck</i> out of here, right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu!” Kiibo says. “Please calm down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no, no, no!” Miu screams. “Y-You!” she points a trembling finger at Kokichi. “Y-You fucking tried to kill me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts as if he was told he couldn’t have another piece of candy. “I did not,” he says. “Kaede, Miu’s telling dirty lies about me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu keeps panicking. “I-I see what’s going on here! You fucking trapped me in here so you could come back and kill me! W-Well,” she scrambles out of Kiibo’s grip awkwardly on to all fours. “I-I’m not gonna let you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her declaration, Miu scuttles past them in a near state of hysteria to the light shining down from the opening Kiibo had created to get down to her. Kaede hears Kiibo calling out her name and Miu screaming as she steps in the dried blood before clumsily pulling herself back out from under the floor. Kiibo begins chasing after her when Miu shrieks again—likely at the sight of Gonta’s body, Kaede guesses—and her heavy footsteps pound out of the room, Angie’s cheery out of place greeting following after her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone with Kokichi under the floor, Kaede lowers her voices and says, “You have some explaining to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “I don’t know. I think Miu covered most of what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I mean,” Kaede says. “So, do you feel like telling me why you basically tormented Miu all night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Kokichi says. “Also, if I were you, I would look around here a little more, and think about part of Miu’s story that seems a little weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m asking you right now about the part that seems weird,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he answers. “You’re not. Buuuut, we’re wasting time! There’re blood stains to investigate!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes but crawls forward towards the splotch of dried blood near the center of the room, under the opening Kiibo created. Upon closer inspection—and with Kokichi shining the light of his monopad over it—Kaede notices that the blood smeared below them seems to be a thick puddle rather than a few haphazard drips. To check, she glances up at the floorboards still overhead. She experimentally runs her fingers over them, but they all appear to be clean except for smudges along the insides of the boards making up their opening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns at it and is about to voice her observation aloud, when she seems Kokichi nonchalantly sweeping his handcuffed hand through the dried blood lying thick on the floor. Kaede, squawks, “What are you doing?” while rearing her hand back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks at her. “I was just trying to see why the blood was clumped up differently in different places. Jeeze, Kaede, you don’t let me do anything fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him but spares a glance down notices that part of the dried blood seems to be more thickly congealed. She squints down at it, noting how it almost seems like something had stopped some of the blood from dripping down. Kokichi moves his monopad to project its glow to the far end of the puddle, and a series of scattered splotches leading the other way through the darkness shine into focus.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen at them, and she tugs on her wrist to signal to Kokichi her intent to move around towards them. “We’re following that trail,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Crawling along in the dark, the increasingly faint smears of blood lead them under another one of the thicker support beams Miu had pointed out earlier, signaling their arrival to the floor below the last of the three rooms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The trail comes to a complete stop at a spot slightly off center, and Kaede stares up through the darkness at the floorboards above them before experimentally reaching up to push on the one directly above them. It moves with almost no resistance other than its natural weight, and Kaede allows herself to straighten into a standing position to push it up and aside completely, finally poking her head out into the next room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pauses for a moment, staring at the board she just moved, examining the uneven cuts on the sides of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s about to ask if the boards in the other room had been cut like that when Kokichi pops up like a jack-in-the-box next to her, saying, “Ta-da! And we’re here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes as she moves to climb out of the newly discovered opening. “Someone,” she says, grunting as she pulls herself up, “obviously was under the floor for some reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi scampers up after her. “Obviously for some reason,” he muses. “You might want to be a little more specific than that at the trial, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede huffs but finally stands, surveying the room. “There’s a good chance the killer was here at some point after the murder,” she says. “I suppose it wouldn’t be too hard to clean up blood in one of the rooms, but they probably didn’t think they’d need to do anything about the space under the floor. Here,” she pulls lightly with her handcuffed wrist. “We need to look around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rocks back and forth on his heels. “Can we start with the big saw-thingie? It looks exciting!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns but sees no reason not to and allows herself to be dragged over to the saw now strangely lying on its side near the opening they just crawled out of. She kneels down to inspect it, noticing a distinct coating of sawdust on the once spotless blade. “The killer probably used this to saw up the floor in here and the other rooms,” she says. “I guess the question now is why…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Kokichi. “The real question is why do you keep assuming things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to him. “‘Assuming things?’” she says, voice hardening. “What do you think I’m assuming?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “You’ll figure it out eventually, now,” he taps a finger to his chin. “What else in here is important, hmm…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says firmly. “Why do you keep talking like you already know everything about the murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles. “I already said—you’re figure it out eventually. Buuut, in the meantime, let’s check out mysterious box number one!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins pulling her over to the large box still situated firmly in the center of the room. Kaede begins inspecting the arm where the saw had been held above it and sees no overt signs of damage or any other indications that it was forcefully pulled apart. “Looks like the killer knew how to take the saw down, and,” she gives the rest of the box a cursory glance over. “Nothing seems broken…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing is broken in here except the floor,” Kokichi says before suddenly dropping down to all fours on the ground, physically yanking Kaede down beside him. “Man, the spaces between the floorboards are really thin in some places—must have been tricky getting a saw through them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “What are you talking about? The killer didn’t saw between the boards—there’s literally nothing there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So there is,” he says before standing again, Kaede warily returning to her feet with a groan. “Well,” he brushes his hands together. “I think we’re done here. Back to room number two!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede insists on giving the room once last cursory look over but finds little else of interest, and she follows Kokichi back out into the hall without complaint.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Upon reentering the second room, Angie immediately gasps in surprise at their arrival. “Kaede? Kokichi? How did you get there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Get where?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie looks from the open space in the floor to them and back again. “Angie saw you go under the floorboards—did you sneak back out without her noticing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are two questions weighing on her mind, and Kaede makes the quick decision to ask the one that gives away the least information. “That’s strange. We were using Kokichi’s monopad to light our way around under there? Did you see the light?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie taps her chin. “Hmm, Angie thinks she saw light around the opening, buuuut God wants to know if you were angling it up back towards the floorboards or not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede recalls their brief crawl through, completely focused on the trail of blood. “Mostly at the ground, I think…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Angie says. “Angie gets it! Maybe if all the lights in here were turned off or something, Angie would have seen the light, though!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says, voice dropping volume. “Even though it’s dark, you can move around under the floorboards without being noticed if you’re careful with your light source…” she presses a hand to her chin. “Maybe the killer used that to take Gonta by surprise or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doesn’t make sense,” Ryoma says, gravelly voice, catching Kaede off guard. “Killer sent him a note. You don’t threaten someone and then try and surprise them.” He keeps staring at Gonta’s body. “Doesn’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Someone sent Gonta a note?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t respond to her, leaving Kaede to awkwardly clear her throat, saying, “Uh, Ryoma found a note on his body telling… telling him to come to the fourth floor at midnight. The killer probably printed it out at the computer room, so unfortunately we can’t try and compare everyone’s hand writing to figure it out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmmm,” Angie says. “Should Angie look around the computer room then? God says we’ve looked at everything important here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You go on ahead,” Kaede says. “There’s still a few things I want to check out first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head back and forth, debating something, before saying, “Okay! But God says not to keep Angie waiting!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She skips out of the room, and with her gone, Ryoma finally says, “Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yes?” Kaede stutters.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said Himiko was killed, too, right?” he says. “Think it was the same person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a sigh. “I don’t know, but,” she bites her lip. “I kind of hope it is. Knowing two different people here could have done something like this, and that one of them could just get away with it like it was nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Makes you sick,” says Kokichi. “Doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares down at him, ready to fight back against his jab at her, when Ryoma says, “Yes.” Kaede snaps her head back to him and sees him clenching his fists. “It does.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quietly, Kaede says to Kokichi, “Come on—we need to go under the floor to get to the last room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They pass by Ryoma silently and reenter the dark passageway. There’s no trail to guide them to the right spot, but using the light of Kokichi’s monopad, they find the still open entrance Kaede assumes Miu used to crawl underneath beforehand.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the candles snuffed out, the room is almost completely pitch black, and Kaede strains her eyes against the darkness. Next to her, Kokichi says, “There’s nothing here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t know that yet,” Kaede insists. “Especially since the killer had to be here since they moved the statues to the middle room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs, saying, “There’s still nothing here,” but doesn’t complain even as they begin their slow search through the dark room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is almost about to agree with him that the excursion was a complete waste of time as much of the room consists of little other than a series of symbols inscribed on the floor that Kaede assumes Angie painted the day before. The actual book for the ritual weighs heavy in her bag, and Kaede absently wonders if Angie had memorized or drawn out the patterns she would need before the book had gone missing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They do come across a discarded handsaw lying flat again the far wall. Kaede examines it briefly, saying, “The killer probably also used this saw to pull up the floorboards. But mostly, I suppose it’s a good thing Miu didn’t bump into this when she had to feel her way around in the dark.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “She would’ve lived. Messed up evidence, but you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is little else of interest that Kaede would deem important to the case at hand, when in one of the far corners, something sparkly and golden leaps to life when it catches the light of Kokichi’s monopad. “There,” Kaede says, pointing to it. “What’s that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She kneels down next to it, brushing her fingers over the strange glitter, and some of the gold immediately latches itself on to her. “This,” she says rubbing it between her fingers. “This was the stuff that was on the statue of Shuichi.” She frowns as the gold seems more persistent to stay on her fingers than she assumed it would be. “Looks like it really likes to stick to stuff, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Have we seen anything like that before?” Kokichi asks. “Anything sparkly and golden and I got yelled at for touching?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, attempting to recall the memory. “Let’s go to Korekiyo’s lab before meeting with Angie,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good choice,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door leading to the hall is still firmly locked from the outside, prompting Kaede to direct them back through the floorboards. Back in the dark path, Kaede is about to bemoan just how dirty she has likely gotten from being forced to crawl for almost the entirety of the investigation when she notices just how bright the gold still coating her fingertips shines with only the slightest touches of light.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns but doesn’t comment on it, and upon hauling herself back up through the hole for what she hopes is the final time, she hears Ryoma say, “Find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede’s attention snaps to him. “A few things, I think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good,” Ryoma says with a slight nod of his head. He reaches into his pocket to begin fiddling with a candy cigarette, an unreadable expression on his face. Then, he says, “If it matters, the last place I saw Gonta last night was his lab.” He shrugs. “Might not be important, but…” he lets out a sigh, “last known locations matters in crime shows or something.” He pulls his hat down. “I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I’ll make sure to search there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi makes a whining noise next to her. “But we already have so many other places to go to, and,” he raises his hand linked to her, “I still have to get these dumb handcuffs off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You put them there!” Kaede says</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And now Kaede-chan’s yelling at me…” he begins to sniffle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says sharply. “Can you get him out of here? I’m not in the mood to listen to him…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quieter, Kokichi whimpers, “Ryoma is so mean to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins to pull him across the room to the door, “We’re leaving, and,” she pauses in the door frame, “I’m really sorry, Ryoma. You…” her eyes linger over Gonta’s body, “You do whatever you need to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t respond, and Kaede and Kokichi walk through the dimly lit halls to Korekiyo’s cavernous lab without a word between them. The door to it still remains in tatters, and Kaede gingerly steps through the gaping hole. She’s waiting for Kokichi to do the same as she glances around the room, and he’s still stepping through when she spies what they came for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems to quickly notice it too, and they move in silence towards the center of the room to get a closer look at the now empty display that had once held a sword sheathed in a sparklingly gold case. Kaede looks closer, and holds up her hand to compare the gold flakes still on her hands to the ones lingering on the display. They’re a near perfect match, and Kaede says, “There’s no way this isn’t related to the case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums in agreement. “The real question now is just where did our mystery sword wandered off to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The killer probably stashed it somewhere,” Kaede answers. “But… why would they even take this sword?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “It’s a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Well, I think that’s the only thing we needed here anyway. We should probably meet up with Angie in the computer room, now, and maybe,” she gestures aggressively with her handcuffed wrist, causing Kokichi to stumble, “we can find something that will get these off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi recovers, and cheerily says, “We won’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s engaged in conversation with Monokuma when they arrive in the computer room. She turns to them and gasps, “There you guys are! Angie was just asking all about how the computers work. Angie doesn’t know a lot about computers, so God said she should ask Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma says, “When I was a young cub, looking for my next big step in life, I held a humble position as an IT employee. Then I moved to a village full of old people to start my real career…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Okay, so, Angie,” she says. “What did you find out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma wilts. “My life story… completely brushed aside like it was nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Okay, okay, so, like, Monokuma told Angie that he doesn’t like to explain things about the computers to people, and they need to figure them out on their own and stuff, but he also said something like printing a note would be super easy for anyone to figure out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “Anyone could have done it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Kokichi says. “But do either of you really think Monokuma would give a hint to the identity of the killer like that anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” says Angie. “God says that’s a good point, which is why he also told Angie to see if there’s a log or something to figure out when people used the computers and stuff!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup!” says Angie, gesturing to a computer. “Monokuma was being super nice and helping Angie look at it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to the bear. “I thought Angie said you don’t like explaining things about the computers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t,” he answers. “But if it’s for an investigation, who am I to get in the way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The person making us kill each other,” Kaede answers curtly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma laughs. “Good point! But as you kids might know, I’m beary busy taking care of a last few bugs caused by a certain incident.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean the blackout?” Kaede asks. “What do you know about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he tilts his head. “I’m afraid I don’t know anything. Bears have very poor night vision, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re just going to keep quiet about it,” Kokichi says. “That’s how you’re playing this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not playing anything!” Monokuma says. “I’ve told you time and time again, any and all nonsense is one hundred percent on you guys. Beat, brutalize, blackout—it’s all got nothing to do with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Kokichi, a strange seriousness creeping over him. “You, Monokuma, the robot bear, had nothing to do with any of the incidents that occurred.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“True, true, true!” says Monokuma. “And you can take my word. Bears never lie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says bears can’t talk,” Angie muses, clicking the mouse absently on the computer before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps going. “I see, buuut,” his smile turns dark, “do your rules apply when there’s nothing to enforce them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma bears his claws. “I’m not sure I like where you’re going with that mister. Are you implying I can’t enforce my own rules? I am an absolute stickler for the rules, I’ll have you know, and I’d give myself over to mushy-gushy hope before I fail to enforce my rules!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede says. “That’s not what Kokichi was asking. He was asking about moments when the rules are… null and void, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s face suddenly goes blank, and without another sound, he waddles away, vanishing to places unknown.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s suspicious,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sooo,” Angie says from her computer. “Angie thinks Monokuma is totally the killer, and also God says this information is really important!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She points to a specific line on the screen before her. Kaede peers at it, and it appears to be a list of times the computers were logged into. The dates go back several days with large chunks of time in between them. “These first ones are probably Miu,” Kaede says. “She comes up here a lot, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “That’s what Angie thinks, buuut what about this latest one?” She points again to a line begins to say when the computers were accessed, but the time is replaced by a series of corrupted symbols. “Angie doesn’t understand this one,” she says. “Even God’s confused by it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at it. “I think we can guess that’s the one we need, and unfortunately, it looks like Monokuma’s protecting the killer. So much for not interfering with the investigation.” She sighs. “Well, I guess there’s nothing else up here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Angie thinks she’s going to try looking around for her keys now. God thinks maybe the killer stole them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten, but she says, “Uh, yeah, that’s a possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They part ways with Angie perhaps a bit too quickly, and on the way down to the third floor, Kokichi says, “Let’s check out Gonta’s lab, and then go back to the dorms.” He shakes his handcuffed wrist. “There’s not much point in wearing this anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means it served its purpose,” he says. “And—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll figure it out eventually?” Kaede interrupts, parroting the mocking words he had thrown at her so many times before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “See that you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but feel a sense of deep sadness when she pushes open the pretty butterfly door to Gonta’s talent lab. Inside, bugs of all species flutter and crawl, and though they emit no emotion, Kaede can’t help but feel they’re waiting for an owner who will never return.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stops, paused in a moment of her own sadness as the loss of one of her friends fully hits her all at once. Kokichi keeps moving forward, wide eyes fixed on something on the center table. Kaede follows his gaze and sees what appears to be a smashed microscope, its pieces scattered in a pile across the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks down at it. “I…” she says, “Was not expecting this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi is far more curious about it then Kaede would have predicted, and his words are an order when he says, “Keep looking around. If there was a microscope, there are probably samples or slides.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede joins him in searching the table, wary of the broken glass littering it. Through her search, she watches Kokichi out of the corner of her eye and notices an odd look of determination on his face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their search yields little, but Kokichi seems hesitant to stop when Kaede announces that if there was anything there, it has likely been removed. “Maybe the killer stole it,” Kaede says when Kokichi finally gives up.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He still staring hard at the table and says, “I doubt that,” before turning back around towards the door without another word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi is oddly quiet the whole way back to the dorms. Kaede remembers him falling silent when he was angry at her, but something about his disposition this time feels different. They move through the school and outside to the dorms, Kaede following along easily enough with the promise of removing the handcuffs hovering before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s already making plans to go back to ask Tenko about the keys when they enter the building, and Kokichi begins climbing the stairs to the girls’ side of the dorms. Kaede immediately stops moving. “I thought we were going to your room?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps looking forward and says, “You need to understand a few things first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His cryptic answer does little to comfort Kaede, but she walks beside him curiously as they ascend the stairs and he turns towards Himiko’s now empty room. The door opens easily enough, and before Kaede can ask, he says, “All rooms unlock during an investigation. I already asked Monokuma, and,” he grins back at her, “he knows I could pick the lock anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just gives him a skeptical look before they step inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s very deliberate about closing the door behind them before flicking on the lights. Kaede blinks a few times, steadying her vision as she surveys the room. Himiko’s room seems to be reasonably normal with a few trinkets and decorations Kaede would naturally associate with a magician scattered around, and the only odd feature is that the blankets seem to have been pulled off her bed and bundled up on the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances to Kokichi, and he merely nods towards it, clearly goading her towards something. With hesitant steps, Kaede approaches it and begins to unwrap the blankets. The first thing she notices is that there are hard object hidden inside, and she feels out something small and circular, slowly stripping off the layers of blankets hiding it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The blankets come off the first object, and Kaede stares with wide eyes at the EMP grenade in her hands. “Why…” she breathes out. “Why did Himiko have this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Keep going.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glances back up to him staring down at her completely stone-faced, and Kaede hurries to uncover the second, much larger and longer object. She’s not nearly as surprised to discover it’s the hammer she remembers Miu showing her, and she sets aside with a feeling of great unease, which only increases when Kaede realizes there are no other hard objects left to find.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where,” she says, more desperately shifting through the blankets, “Where’s the other EMP grenade?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not hard to figure out,” Kokichi says dully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes flicker over his face, searching for anything as she whispers, “The blackout…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “Wow, Kaede, you figured it out, and the trial hasn’t even started yet. Though,” he looks at his nails, “this doesn’t really seem like a mystery we should talk about in front of everyone else, does it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then start answering my questions right now,” Kaede says, staggering to her feet and jabbing one finger into his skinny chest. “Why are these in Himiko’s room? The only people who should know about these are you, me, and Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, clearly,” he says. “One of us told her. And if it wasn’t you, and Miu was locked in a room all night and all morning…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You gave these to her,” Kaede says firmly. “Which means…” she furrows her brow, deep in thought, “which means… you two planned the blackout…” She presses a hand to her forehead in frustration. “That’s why you knew how long it would last—Miu told you how long the EMP lasts, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Correct again,” Kokichi smiles. “Now you’re getting somewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede’s mind races with questions to ask. “How? I know the EMPs turn off power, but how could they shut down the entire school? How could they turn off the sky!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You, me, and Miu already know the answer to that, too,” Kokichi says. “And that answer is the solution to why Himiko was killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “You knew she would be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says blankly. “I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes at him, searching for anything. “Are you lying again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pauses, and instead of answering her question, her jerks his chin towards Himiko’s closet. “I’m done talking about Himiko. But, if you want another clue, look in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With wary eyes still on Kokichi, Kaede walks to the closet and pushes the doors open. Inside, bundled up beneath the sets of matching clothes, is another one of Himiko’s identical outfits, the front of it absolutely coated in dried blood.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at it openmouthed for a moment, then, “Why would this be…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Unfold it,” and Kaede hears the smile in his voice when he says, “another clue awaits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glances at him over her shoulder, and he winks back at her before she sets about the grim task of unfolding the bloody school uniform. In the center of it sits a key covered in sparkling gold glitter. Kaede cautiously picks it up and turns it over in her hands a few times. “This,” she says, “this is the key to the third room on the fourth floor. Angie said it had gone missing, but Himiko… Himiko took it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be,” Kokichi says shrugging. “Now, let me just grab my things, and we can head straight over to my room, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him, briefly wondering what he means by ‘his things,’ but her question answers itself as he drags her back towards the hammer and remaining EMP grenade, quickly shuffling them back into the blanket and hugging the bundle close to his chest. He nods at the door, and Kaede rolls her eyes as she opens it for him before he starts practically skipping back to his room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi quickly fishes his key out of his pocket, and his door swings open easily. “Make yourself at home before I kick you out, Kaede!” he says merrily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steps inside Kokichi’s almost absurdly cluttered room, closing the door behind her, and following him to his closet where he deposits the bundle underneath the row of matching straightjackets hanging above.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Kokichi busies himself with that, Kaede looks around in near awe at the sheer amount of stuff piled up in almost every inch of his floor. Her eyes settle on one object in particular.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You stole Miu’s drone,” Kaede says, taking a step towards the machine, lying on the ground at the foot of his bed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi says, finally looking up. “Oh, yeah. I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede huffs and begins to say, “Why would you…” but her words die as soon as she spies the small piles of photos sitting next to the drone. “These are…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The photos Miu took,” Kokichi says. He walks over and easily picks up the first one, turning it towards her. “They’re quite enlightening, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The photo in his hand shows a near perfect overhead view of the library the day of Rantaro’s murder and an even more perfect view of the books stacked in the exact pattern to kill him. Kaede pales. “When did you take these?” she asks very quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums, absently leafing through the damning photos. “The day before Miu started whining about the drone being stolen. Guess she didn’t notice the photos being gone, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard down at him, racking her brain for the right words to say to him. She settles on, “So you know what happened that day, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kokichi replies. “But I knew even before I got the photos. A liar like me can easily tell when an amateur’s trying, and Shuichi sure did his best, but I could tell before he even opened his mouth. Of course, I also knew before that, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re very smart, I get it,” Kaede hisses. “So what are you going to do? Why are you keeping these—blackmail? Do you want something from me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he answers plainly. “I don’t want anything from a killer like you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, Kaede finds herself speechless, and Kokichi produces another key from his pocket, sticking it into the lock on the handcuffs. They come free, and Kaede brings her hand to her chest protectively. Kokichi nonchalantly pulls his own hand free and sets the handcuffs and key aside. Kaede watches him, and says, “Are you going to show these to everyone, then? Expose me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shakes his head. “No—at least not now.” He grins up at her. “Maybe when the time is right, but now I just want you to get out of my face, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stares hard at him for a moment, weighing her next words in whatever battle they’re waging carefully, and finally says, “I don’t know what you think of me, Kokichi, but I’m not your enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just hums, returning to leafing through the pictures. “Did you say that to Rantaro, too? Or maybe Shuichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands firm, refusing to flinch at his words. “I know what I’ve done is unforgivable, but that doesn’t change our current situation. You can hate me and mistrust me as much as you want, but I am still not your enemy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That remains to be seen,” he says. “Now get out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him for a moment longer before letting out a resigned sigh. She walks to the door but finds herself almost involuntarily pausing. She glances back to see Kokichi still disinterestedly looking through the photos, and Kaede says, “I don’t know what you think insulting me is going to accomplish, but whatever games you’re playing are only going to result in more people getting hurt. For your sake, I hope you can live with that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stays quiet, perhaps pretending not have heard her, and with a strange, angry bitterness surging through her, Kaede opens his door and slams it shut behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a deep breath to steady herself and moves to walk out of the dorms when the doors slam open. Miu stomps inside, Kiibo trailing after her, apparently still trying to calm her down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s yelling obscenities about something, and Kaede barely registers what they’re saying when she walks past her, and says, “Miu, Kokichi’s the one who took your drone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps walking, but she hears Miu let out a squawk behind her before the doors to the dorm swing shut.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses only when she reaches the entrance to the cafeteria, taking in a deep breath to let some of her anger subside before confronting what she knows lies on the other side of the heavy doors.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pushes them open and finds Tenko as she left her, quietly sitting next to Himiko’s body, gently holding her lifeless hand. Kaede notes that Tsumugi must have left at some point as she makes her way across the near empty room to Tenko’s side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Staring down at Himiko’s body the second time, Kaede finds herself at a near loss of what to say. No, she decides, there is nothing to say—nothing one can say when such a horrible incident occurs. With a shaky breath, she says, “Did you find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stays quiet a moment longer and reaches up to brush at her eyes. Her voice is still half chocked with tears when she says, “Tenko…” she lets out another breath, “Tenko tried searching Himiko’s body more, and the only thing she found in any of her pockets was that.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko points to a small piece of glass and plastic that looks like part of a broken camera lens sitting on the table in front of her. Kaede frowns at it and exchanges an affirming look with Tenko before picking it up to turn over in her hands. “Was there anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “No,” she says, voice wavering, and Kaede can tell just how difficult every word is for her. “Even Himiko’s monopad and the key to her room were missing. Tenko thinks… Tenko thinks the killer probably took them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s strange,” Kaede says. “But, that also means they had to stash them somewhere, right? If we can find out where, maybe we can discover who did this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks up at her with hopeful eyes. “Do you have any ideas, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One,” Kaede says. “And I think we can thank Himiko for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Confusion crosses Tenko’s face for a moment before she moves to pat at her pocket and eventually produces the key she had mysteriously discovered on her person that morning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares at it wordlessly, and Kaede says, “This morning when she hugged you—I think Himiko really wanted to make sure you would have it. Maybe it was in case something happened to her, or maybe because she knew you were someone she could trust.” She places a reassuring hand on Tenko’s shoulder. “Or maybe both.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko keeps staring at the key and her hand tightens around it, knuckles turning white. “Then Tenko will do everything she can to figure out why Himiko wanted her to have this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “I think that’s a good idea, and,” she smiles with the first bit of triumph she’s felt all investigation, “I think I might no where it leads to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks around hurriedly to make sure no one is watching them when they stand just outside Angie’s lab on the fourth floor. With the coast clear, she gestures for Tenko to try the key. Exactly as Kaede assumed, the door opens easily, and the two girls scurry inside, clicking the door shut behind them as silently as they can.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The excitement over their need for stealth fades as soon as they actually begin to look around the room and discover it to be nearly exactly as they remembered it from the day before. Some of the paints appear a little more used or our shuffled together in different spots on the floor, but overall, nothing stands out as changed. Kaede makes a point of searching any areas that could potentially conceal any of the many missing items the killer probably hid somewhere prior to the investigation. Curiously—and to her increasing frustration—her efforts remain fruitless, and she regularly calls out to Tenko to ask the other girl for updates in her search efforts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a feeling of defeat, Kaede approaches Tenko examining a few of the tools Angie likely used to make the wax sculptures. Though the sudden display of knives and sharp artist tools is a little off-putting, none of them appear to have been used on anything other than wax. “Tenko doubts any of these were used in either of the murders.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have to agree,” Kaede says. “I’m not sure what I was expecting, but it’s certainly not here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko feels the same way, but,” she pulls the key out of her pocket for a second time. “It was still important to Himiko that Tenko would have this key. And,” she holds it close to her chest, “Tenko still believes there is a reason for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a sympathetic smile, and over the speakers, an announcement telling them they’re officially out of time begins to play.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede and Tenko exchange worried looks, but Kaede sighs, saying, “I suppose there’s nothing left to do other than do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure how helpful she’ll be,” she says. “But, she really, really, <i>really</i> wants to find out what happened to Himiko, and… and why she had to die the way she did…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows there’s nothing else to say to that, and she places one comforting hand on Tenko’s shoulder as they begin the walk back down to the elevator landing leading them to the class trial.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others are all already there, and Kaede hears Miu’s voice screaming at Kokichi long before she sees them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi, for his part, seems rather bored by the increasingly colorful obscenities being screeched at him and perks up at seeing Kaede and Tenko round the corner into his field of view. “Ooh,” he says. “Looks like we’re all here now, even if one of us is a dirty tattletale.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just rolls her eyes at him as Kaito approaches, Maki noticeably shadowing him. “Hey,” he says. “I was able to get some shit about the investigation out of Kokichi, but it could all be complete bullcrap for all I know. In fact,” he looks back at Kokichi happily waving to him, “I think I can guarantee at least half of it fucking is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Kaede. “I’ll make sure to go over most of my findings at the start of the trial for everyone, also,” she frowns, fiddling with the brim of her cap, “sorry to ask for this so late, but can you tell me what you were doing during the blackout? I know about most people, but you and…” she looks at Maki who pointedly looks away, “well, I’m missing you and a few others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs at his chin in thought. “Well, I didn’t fucking notice the power had gone to shit at first since I was sleeping late this morning. Harumaki came banging on my door though probably some time right after it started to check on me, and then Tenko came running into the dorms a little later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Were you all together the entire time?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Tenko. “Tenko left shortly after that to keep searching the gardens. She ran into Kiibo a few times, but other than that she was alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “I stayed in my room for most of it. I figured if the fucking lights were off anyway, I might as well sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki left?” Kaede persists, and she notices Maki stiffen out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “She said there was something she wanted to check out while the power was off. Came back to get me when they turned back on, but other than that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… very interesting,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki finally speaks up, saying, “The trial hasn’t even started yet. If you want to falsely accuse me of being the killer, you can do it then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Clearly having overhead their conversation, Miu loudly snorts, and says, “‘Course you’re not the fucking killer.” She jerks a thumb over her shoulder. “Every idiot here knows it has to be Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to sniffle. “Miu’s spreading filthy lies about me… I guess it makes sense for a pig like her, but still…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All of you,” Ryoma says, deep voice immediately putting an end to all conversations. “All of you just shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A deeply uncomfortable silence falls over the group again, as the full meaning of why they’re there and what will come next seems to hit them all at once.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The elevator opens its doors, and looking at Ryoma file in alone and without a sound, Kaede finds no motivational speeches or words of encouragement to offer this time. Inside the elevator, Tenko tries to offer her an encouraging smile, and it dawns on Kaede just how red her eyes are and how tired not just her face but entire body looks, worn out through sheer emotional exhaustion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows every piece of fear and anger and just plain sadness threatening to rise over her as the elevator doors slide shut, and they begin to move down to yet another trial where Kaede will have to condemn one of her friends to their agonizing death.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Slightly shorter chapter than the past few (by which I mean it's only 8k instead of 10k, haha) but I figured this was a reasonable stopping point so the trial can begin in earnest next time!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also, I think now is as reasonable a time as any to mention that at the pace I am moving (aka slow), this story is probably not going to be finished until several months after the English release for V3 comes out, and though I am going to wait to play through it a bit myself to get a feel for various localization choices, I ultimately do want this story to age as well as possible. Basically this means I'm debating making certain edits later on (i.e. Kiibo-&gt; Keebo, potentially Tenko's speech patterns, etc.) but there are still definitely some things I plan on keeping (mostly honorifics). Of course, I definitely want to know if anyone has strong thoughts/opinions and let everyone know I will only make said edits after I've played through some of the localization myself, so this is just a heads up for everyone before I get too embroiled in the trial, haha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also, RandomMunchkin on Ao3 drew fanart for the last chapter, which is amazing! There's a link in the notes of the last chapter, so check it out! Thank you so, so much!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They step into the trial room, and Kaede finds her podium now marked on either sides by matching crossed out portraits of Gonta and Himiko flanking her. She spies Korekiyo’s portrait, bright smears of red rather than an X obscuring his face, and Kaede bites her lip as she prepares herself for what she has to do next. She surveys the room, almost numbly noting that she did most of the investigating, and thus the responsibility of everyone’s lives falls on her. The responsibility of killing one more of their friends falls on her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma finishes his explanation that they have all heard too many times, saying, “Now get to arguing! And remember, in the case of super duper special double murders, only the killer of the first victim counts as the blackened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Question,” Kokichi says, raising his hand in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma sighs before biting out, “What? Did I not make myself clear?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think it applies to this case,” Kokichi says, “But what happens if someone kills someone, and then someone else kills them? Would the new killer count as the blackened, or would we have to vote for the dead person because they killed first. And if that’s the case, wouldn’t that mean we could just keep—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma bears his claws in agitation. “<i>If</i> and only if such a thing were to occur, then the killer of the first killer would become blackened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito, scratching the back of his head. “So I think Kokichi’s just trying to fucking confuse us, but if that’s a rule, then what happens if there’s like a third murder or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kokichi. “What if—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, fine,” Monokuma hisses. “You want an answer: none of that applies here, you hear me! Zip! Squat! Nothing! So stop asking!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means,” Kokichi concludes. “We can assume Himiko is not the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That much is obvious,” Maki says. “It’s high unlikely someone as small as her could have overpowered Gonta anyway. Not to mention,” she sighs, crossing her arms, “according to Monokuma’s clarification, even in the ridiculous event that she did manage to kill, Himiko was clearly murdered herself. The only way to view her in this case is as a victim, plain and simple.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Which means Himiko is innocent! Isn’t that great?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kiibo says. “What exactly are you trying to achieve through this line of questioning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weeeeell,” he says. “If you think about the fact that Gonta was killed in a room that only Himiko had the keys to, and if she couldn’t have done it, that means we have a real flesh and blood locked room mystery!” Practically bouncing at his stand, Kokichi says, “Isn’t that exciting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Except you can fucking pick locks!” Miu shouts, jabbing an accusing finger at him. “Don’t even try to lie, you little cocksucking gremlin!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” asks Angie, tilting her head. “Is Kokichi the killer then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It could be a possibility,” Tsumugi muses. “Of course, in most mystery games, when there’s seemingly a locked room, it’s usually not as locked as you think it is. Like, the killer only temporarily locked it with glue or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “I hate glue…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Glue, lube, shit—it doesn’t matter!” Miu yells. “You’re obviously the fucking killer, so let’s just vote already to kill his scrawny ass!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kiibo says sternly. “You need to calm down. Though Kokichi is certainly suspicious, it would be rash to jump to voting so soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaito. “I mean, don’t get me wrong—it’d be fucking great if Kokichi was the killer—but we have these stupid trials for a reason and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu just glares, not wilting even under their scolding. “I’m telling you dickless virgins, it doesn’t matter how long and hard or if we go all night arguing back and forth—Kokichi’s absolutely the killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know,” Kokichi says, pressing a finger to his lips. “You’re pushing this awfully hard, Miu. Guilty conscience?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s gripping the sides of her podium, ready to shout again, when Ryoma’s voice cuts through the room. “Shut up,” he says. “If you’re going to be useless, just shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrinks in on herself then. “Eeeeey! I-I’m just tryin’ to f-find the culprit and shit…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki lets out a sigh, saying, “Ryoma’s right. Your useless yelling is getting us no where.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe it would be best to first go over a quick summary of what happened this morning,” Kiibo says. “Kaede, you and Kokichi were the first to discover the body this morning correct? And then Himiko’s body later as well? It seems you two would know the most then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Maki mumble, “Discovering both bodies—that’s suspicious…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her shoulders. “Like Kiibo said, this morning, the first people to discover Gonta’s body were me, Tenko, and Kokichi. The blackout started immediately after that, in the middle of the body announcement, in fact.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wrong,” says Kokichi. “Tenko found the body, then the announcement went off, <i>then</i> me and Kaede found him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Tenko found it slightly before you guys?” Kaito asks. “Does that matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow. “Tenko did find it first, but nothing changed between then and when Kaede came.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” says Angie. “Maybe Kokichi thinks Tenko’s the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is not the killer,” she says firmly. “If Kokichi is implying that she tampered with the crime scene, he is mistaken.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “Besides, I think we can rule out Tenko doing anything to disrupt evidence after she found the body—there just wouldn’t have been enough time for her to do anything, and,” she crosses her arms, “the crime scene was setup in a pretty specific way—I think it’s safe to assume the killer did so beforehand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right, that’s right,” says Angie. “The crime scene was super spooky and stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “W-Wait, I just thought of something! You know how at the crime scene, all the statues except Shuichi’s were stabbed? What if that means he came back as a ghost, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no fucking way that’s what happened!” Kaito shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh, but what if it did?” Angie asks. “What if Angie’s ritual was a complete success, and Shuichi is here with us now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And… his ghost is the culprit?” Kaede says, attempting to piece together the absolutely bizarre argument in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But doesn’t it make sense?” Tsumugi asks. “I mean, the motive was to bring someone back from the dead, and we never really figured out how that was connected to someone being murdered, so what if Angie summoned a vengeful spirit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “Oh, Angie sure hopes she didn’t. God says Angie’s job is to keep the school safe for people and ghosts alike.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop fucking talking about this bullshit,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo fidgets slightly at his stand. “Though it may seem impossible, I believe Tsumugi is right in that as long as we consider what the motive behind this case is, we cannot fully rule out the presence of ghosts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns and adjusts the brim of her hat as she accepts the fact that she has to handle this issue if there is to be any hope of moving forward in the conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The motive in this case,” Tsumugi begins, “was resurrecting someone who died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Most likely suspect is Sighhara, right?” Miu asks. “‘Cause his was the only statue that didn’t take a sword up the ass?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I keep telling you,” Kaito says. “There are no ghosts, the ritual is bullshit, and even if you did everything that shitty book said, you wouldn’t fucking summon anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But God said Angie could use it to bring back someone,” Angie says. “So maybe there is a ghost hanging around!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop saying that…” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki physically turns away from her trial stand, saying, “There’s a limit to how much ridiculousness I can take.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s it,” Kaede says. “Kaito, you’re right—Angie never completed the ritual, and Monokuma said we could only resurrect someone if we followed all the steps in the instruction book.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s the reasoning you’re using for why a ghost can’t be the culprit,” Maki says. “Not the fact that it’s impossible, and anyone who thinks otherwise is an idiot?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Just telling someone they’re wrong without showing them evidence doesn’t move our argument forward—no matter what we’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tsumugi says. “So does that mean you have evidence that Angie plainly didn’t finish the resurrection ritual, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says. She pauses for a moment to take her backpack off her shoulders and lift the little black book out of it. “Because I have the instruction book.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “That’s where that went! Angie wrote down a lot of stuff for herself because God warned her the book would go missing, and one member of her student council would betray her. Angie didn’t think Kaede would be the one to steal it, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces slightly. “Ah, well, I did. I thought it was the only way to stop a murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good job on that front,” Miu snorts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you know what time you took it?” Ryoma asks, pointedly ignoring Miu’s comment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last evening,” Kaede says. “It was before we went to help Himiko rehearse from her show. I… don’t think the timing has anything to do with the murders, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “If it had been this morning or something… maybe, but,” he pulls his hat down a little farther. “It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I get your point. But, I think we can safely conclude that ghosts had nothing to do with this incident.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wait, friends!” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito almost automatically bites back, “We’re not your friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps going. “A motive is still a motive! And if Kaede had the motive during the murders, doesn’t that make her suspicious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede is not the culprit,” Tenko says sharply.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can blindly stick up for her as much as you want,” Maki says. “But Kokichi’s right. Of everyone here, Kaede had the biggest incentive to try to bring someone back. Not only that,” she continues, “but she also joined Angie’s student council who intended to resurrect someone, and then stole the book from them.” She turns her glare to Kaede. “My guess is Angie planned to bring back someone other than Shuichi, and Kaede decided to take matters into her own hands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what happened,” Kaede says, standing her ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins sniffling. “Wow, Maki is so mean. I’m glad she’s not mad at me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What happened,” Kaede continues, “is that I took the book to stop anyone else from using. Tenko is my witness. We were together when I took it and spent the rest of the day together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” Tenko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m afraid I do not think that is sufficient for an alibi,” Kiibo says. “Gonta’s murder occurred at midnight—were you still together then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t miss a beat, immediately countering with, “We were. Tenko was worried about Himiko’s show the next day, so she stayed in my room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks for a moment at her lie, but manages to back her up with a stuttered, “Th-That is also correct. Tenko… did not want to mention it due to… due to Miu’s comments last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squawks. “I only said what was fucking true!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi turns to Kaede, raising an eyebrow, and to her surprise he says, “Hmm, now that I think about it—I did see Tenko go into Kaede’s room with her last night. I thought they were staying up to plot evil things, so I didn’t really talk to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede regards him carefully before saying, “I didn’t know Kokichi was watching, but that is what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “I’m always watching.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So in conclusion,” Kaito says. “Kaede and Tenko have alibis for Gonta’s death, and they had the motive with them, so… did the killer even fucking care about the motive?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “If no one summoned any ghosts, then I think we can only assume that it didn’t, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says. “We’re being too literal with the motive. We’ve talked about this a few times, but returning one of our dead friends to us by doing a simply ritual—that’s not really a reason to kill, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says darkly. “But people kill for all kinds of stupid reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “I hate to say it, but Ryoma’s right—I once played a game and they said, um, ‘there are as many reasons to kill as there are people in the world.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tsumugi,” Angie says. “God thinks that’s weirdly dark coming from you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi quickly waves her hands. “Ah, but just because you play violent games doesn’t mean you’re a violent person. I mean, I can tell the difference between fiction and reality.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, so, anyway, where does all that fucking get us?” Kaito asks. “Is it, like, the opposite or something? Someone killed because they wanted to stop anyone from being resurrected?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After a killing,” Maki says. “It is safe to say a motive effectively ends, and Monokuma presents the next one. If someone wanted to preemptively stop the ritual, then they very well could have resorted to murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Angie says. “Who would want to do that? God says everyone wanted to see our old friends again.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Well, who was the one person scared absolutely shitless at the idea of ghosts crawling up his ass?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito yells, “Shut the fuck up! I’m not the killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Kokichi says. “My beloved Kaito was super extra scared, but he knew I would protect him from the ghosts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m getting really fucking tired of you,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a sigh. “If it matters, Kaito never showed up to the crime scene this morning. Don’t know if that makes him more suspicious or less, but,” he shrugs. “That’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kaito. “I never fucking set foot on the fourth floor after we finished exploring it and shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo thinks for a moment before saying, “Is there anyone else who can confirm that? It would be highly unlikely someone spent the night of the murder with you like Kaede, but if you have anyone who—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I saw him,” Maki says. “He comes to bang on my door every morning and every night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head. “Oh? Angie doesn’t get it. How does that make Kaito not the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s not the killer,” Maki states again. “He was scared of the ritual and likely didn’t even know where or when it was supposed to take place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kaito. “Except, uh, except for the me being fucking scared part, but yeah!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, and Kokichi voices her thoughts aloud. “Telling lies won’t impress me, Kaito,” he says, placing a finger to his lips.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In a less accusatory tone, Kaede says, “I don’t think you’re the killer, but, well everyone except for maybe Maki knew Angie’s plans for the resurrection before the murder. I told you all myself at dinner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then he forgot,” Maki says. “And if that’s your reason for suspecting him that means everyone is equally suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Maki,” Tsumugi says. “I don’t mean to pry, but why are you arguing for Kaito? Do you know something else about the murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki goes silent for a moment. Then, “If you all haven’t forgotten, Kaito was also injured. Choosing to kill someone like Gonta while hurt would have been incredibly stupid even for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you didn’t answer my question…” Tsumugi mumbles sadly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment, then, “I don’t know if Maki is choosing to hide information for us again or not, but I do think the choice of Gonta as the victim can tell us something about the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean,” Kaede says, “The killer didn’t choose Gonta at random, and they were very deliberate about how they contacted him. And I think I know exactly what evidence proves it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma begins, saying, “The killer… they purposefully lured out Gonta specifically…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I really don’t fucking no anything about that,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What kind of fucking brain dead moron,” Miu chimes in, “targets someone like big dick? You’d get your fucking head ripped off if you threatened him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you threatened him…” Ryoma mutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Seriously,” Kaito says. “What the fuck are you guys talking about? Kokichi didn’t tell me shit about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “Guess I left this part out. Oh, well! I’m sure Kaede will figure it out for you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “I think Kaito’s confusion is proof enough that he’s not the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma knows exactly what I’m about to say,” Kaede says, “because on Gonta’s body, he found a note from the killer threatening him into going to the fourth floor at midnight. It was printed out, so unfortunately we can’t use handwriting to figure out who wrote it, but it’s definitely important evidence in how the killer communicated with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With almost no emotion in his voice, Ryoma says, “The note said I would be killed if he didn’t show.” He looks to Kaede, an unreadable expression on his face, and says, “If you’re hiding that fact to protect me, knock it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but wince at his words. “Ah, s-sorry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, but, but,” Angie says. “Angie knew about the note and stuff, but how does that prove Kaito’s not the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Miu says. “I mean, closet case over here is dumb as fuck, but that doesn’t mean he couldn’t figure out how to use one of Monokuma’s shitty printers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito shouts. “I know how to use a fucking printer! I-I’m still not the killer, though!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not helping your case,” Maki reprimands. “And the point Kaede’s trying to make is that the killer needed to go through with creating a note in the first place. Going to the trouble of printing out a threatening note is risky—if someone had noticed, their plan would have been ruined before it began.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I am afraid I am still not seeing the connection. Do you mean to say Kaito would not go to such a risk?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He wouldn’t need to,” Kaede says. “Kaito’s someone Gonta would have probably just followed to the fourth floor if he asked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get it,” Ryoma says quietly. “The fact that there’s a note at all… it means the killer wasn’t someone he trusted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” says Angie. “But there’s something Angie doesn’t understand. If the killer knew Gonta had a note from them, why would they leave it on his body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shrugs. “Untrained killers make mistakes. Most criminals are caught because something went wrong with their crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie doesn’t seem satisfied with her answer, and goes on, “But Angie still doesn’t get it. God thinks that would be a pretty silly mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “Like I said before, the note was pretty anonymous. Even if the killer did know Gonta brought it with him, they probably assumed it couldn’t be traced back to them. Angie, you remember looking at login records in the computer room, right? Even the information about when they used the computers to do it was hidden, so they were pretty safe in the event that someone would discover it later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sooo,” says Kaito. “Does that mean I’m good now? And we can actually, like, go back to fucking talk about the case and shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Though I do not believe the presence of a threatening note alone is enough to remove all of our suspicions,” Kiibo says. “I think for now we should set aside random accusations and discuss the case at length without the bias of a specific suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, okay, I guess Kiiboy has a point,” Kokichi says. “Soooo, Kaede, why don’t you clear up one last thing for us first? What,” he smiles brightly at her, “is the real truth behind the motive this time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him, standing only one podium away from her, and with her eyes on him, she chooses her words carefully, saying, “Tenko and I discussed this awhile ago before the murders, and we came to the conclusion that the goal of this motive was to create conflict and get us to divide ourselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A brief silence falls over everyone, and Kaede swallows before continuing. “The killing game keeps going because… because it’s easy to think everyone’s against you or that you need to do something drastic.” She reaches up to straighten Shuichi’s hat. “The motive of bringing someone back from the dead played into our heightened emotions. People having strong reactions and clashing with each other was almost inevitable with something like that hanging over us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito curses. “Damnit. And we played right into that from the start, didn’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says. “I see now… with the way things were going, Gonta had…” he lets out a sigh, “he had every reason to believe that note…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hugs one of her arms. “That means that we’re all to blame, huh? Since that kind of tense atmosphere couldn’t have been created without all of us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “There are still a few things I don’t understand about the killer’s motives, but mostly I want to know if they used the tensions between us as a cover for their crime or if they did what they did because they thought they were protecting themselves. But either way,” she shakes her head. “This crime is still unforgivable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says suddenly, voice cutting through the courtroom. “But what about Himiko? Why… why did she die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s words seem to tangibly linger in the air, immediately stopping all conversations in their tracks. For all she had to say only moments ago, Kaede finds herself suddenly speechless and unable to even look at what she images is the pure misery on Tenko’s face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the tense silence, Kokichi’s the one to answer her. “Because she tried to fight back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s attention snaps to him. Tenko says, “Kokichi, what are you talking about? What do you know about Himiko’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stays quiet, and Kaito hazards a guess about his cryptic words. “Are you saying she fought with her killer or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Kokichi says. “I don’t know—it was real dark, and I was with Kaede the whole time. So I don’t know anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snarls. “You shit for brains idiots still think he’s not the fucking killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kiibo says gently. “There is still more to discuss.” He frowns. “And for the case of Himiko’s death, Kokichi is one of the few people who has a solid alibi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That… is true. I think I asked everyone where they were during the blackout, and with the exception of Kokichi and myself, I think everyone else had periods of time when they were alone.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And since there’s no time of death on the fucking Monokuma File,” Kaito says. “That means anyone could have done it, yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie raises a hand. “God told Angie to protect all of her student council members, so she would never hurt Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “Anyone can say something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s true,” Angie insists. “And Angie always listens to what God has to say, and he said to make sure everyone in the student council stayed safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Maki says, clearly ignoring her. “It’s suspicious that Kokichi and Kaede are the only people who have alibis.” She crosses her arms. “And Kaede seems to be the only person who has an alibi for both murders, since Kokichi, of all people, confirmed it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her. “Maki, what are you trying to imply?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko believes the fact that Kaede has alibis for both incidents means she is the least suspicious person, not the most,” Tenko argues.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “Think for yourself for once. This entire situation is entirely too convenient for Kaede. She has a confirmed liar vouching for her for both murders, and was one of the people to discover both bodies.” Maki turns her dead eyed stare to Kaede. “I believe there is no chance she isn’t involved in this somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to meet her glare. “Hey, Maki, aren’t you like the thief who accuses everyone else of being a thief? Just because you think about killing all the time doesn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You automatically suspect me because of my talent,” Maki says. “But my being an assassin doesn’t mean no one else here isn’t capable of killing. It doesn’t mean you’re not the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to argue back again when Kaito beats her to it, saying, “Oi, Harumaki. I thought we decided we were done randomly accusing people and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki whips her head to him but remains stonily silent. Kaito presses on. “Maybe Kaede does know something, or maybe all of the shit you just said is a coincidence. But we can’t talk about that stuff if you just back her into a corner, and I believe,” he slams his fists together, “there’s no way you or Kaede would try and kill anyone here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Man, Kaito, you sure know how to pick ‘em.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” he says. “I’m trying to make a fucking point here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki remains quiet a moment longer, then, with a sigh, “Fine. I’ll drop my accusations for now. Just,” she turns away from him. “Just don’t let yourself fall for a lie because it’s more convenient than the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins. “Will do, Harumaki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls. “I told you to stop calling me that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, anyway,” says Tsumugi. “Since we’ve plainly cleared up the killer’s motive, I’d like to ask a question.” She folds her hands in front of her, politely asking, “If it’s not too much trouble, I’d like to know why the crime scene on the fourth floor was arranged the way it was… it was pretty disturbing when I went up there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “That is a good question, Tsumugi. Angie and I investigated the statues alongside Kaede and Kokichi, however we did not find anything that pointed to why they were set up like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup!” says Angie. “We looked them all over and didn’t find anything!” She puffs out her cheeks. “But God still says whoever defaced Angie’s art should come forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “Like hell that’s gonna happen. Whoever spit-roasted the statues has to be the killer. And,” Kaede can physically see her gaining confidence, “they probably made ‘em that way to hide the murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, thinking intently as the others begin to talk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the crime scene,” Kiibo says, “the killer moved the statues there and stabbed three of them with swords.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says whoever did should just confess,” Angie says. “Angie will only be slightly really mad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Obviously,” Miu says, “the killer penetrated Angie’s crappy sex dolls to hide the murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One of the swords was the murder weapon,” Kiibo echoes. “Angie and I found no bloodstains on them—could one of them still have been used to kill Gonta?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-They washed off the blood first!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito chimes in, “Wouldn’t a sword sticking out of a statue be really fucking obvious? I dunno if the killer would do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The—the k-killer thought we would think that,” Miu says, quickly unraveling. “A-And so they assumed we would dismiss it, s-so that’s why they did it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That seems… needlessly complex,” Kiibo says. “Maybe we’re on the wrong track, and none of the swords were used.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie huffs. “God is still waiting for someone to confess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “I think that’s it—none of the swords for Himiko’s magic show were used.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “I was mostly referring to the ones in Angie’s statues, but you believe none of them were used?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, come on,” Miu says. “I was up to my fucking tits in swords in that room, and you’re saying the killer just ignored all of them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “From the beginning, the murder weapons in both Gonta and Himiko’s cases have been bothering me. I’m still not sure about what was used to kill Himiko, but if Gonta was killed in the box where we found him for Himiko’s magic show, then it would have been impossible for the culprit to use one of the swords to kill him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe I’m simply misunderstanding, but isn’t that box designed to put swords through?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Tenko says. “Last night… Tenko helped Himiko rehearse her magic tricks—when we used the box Gonta was killed in, Himiko explained that it was completely safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That’s right, and when we were moving the stuff for Himiko’s tricks up to the fourth floor, I actually looked over that one personally before she explained how it worked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” says Kokichi. “So you’re saying Himiko’s tricks aren’t actually magic, I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not the point here,” Kaede says. “The point is that that box is purposefully safeguarded to prevent what happened to Gonta from happening to anyone using it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” Tenko says. “Tenko experienced it several times first hand, and she was never harmed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “I’m not sure I understand. Isn’t the purpose of the box to put swords through it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Kaede says. “But it’s setup that the holes in it have different widths. For Himiko’s trick, she would use a mix of thin fake swords and thick real swords and the only holes wide enough for the real swords to go through were setup to direct them at angles away from the person inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, maybe the killer just fucking forced one of the real ones through or something?” Miu says. “Like, even if you’ve got a small opening, you can still—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop,” Ryoma says, voice harsh. “Nobody wants to here it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu starts sniveling. “Eeeey! I-I’m j-just trying to help…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not,” Ryoma says. “And there were no signs of damage on the box—I would’ve noticed if there were splinters or something when I moved him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, but what does all of that mean?” Kaito asks. “Did the killer use something else to kill him?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unfortunately,” Kiibo says. “I was unable to find anything else that seemed like it could have been the murder weapon at the crime scene in my investigation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, that’s right, that’s right,” Angie says. “And Angie remembers the Monokuma File says Gonta was stabbed, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which would point to the murder weapon still being one of Himiko’s swords,” Maki says. “It’s the most logical answer, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so…” Tsumugi says. “Um, but if people don’t mind, maybe summarizing what we think happened to Gonta will show something wrong with our thinking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. The few clues she knows she and Kokichi know alone circle her mind, but staring out over her classmates, she decides to wait, wary of drawing something out—wary of all the mysteries still unanswered. She catches Kokichi looking at her out of the corner of his eyes, and she adjusts her hat to block him out. She says, “I think that would be for the best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kaito, completely blind to her internal struggle. “If we all work fucking together, I’m sure we can figure it out and beat the culprit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Kokichi. “And then maybe the power of friendship will show us an exit and we can all leave together, and hold hands and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” Kaito shouts. “Alright, we can all work together except for you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts sniffling. “Kaito… you’re going to make me cry…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, anyway,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe we should start talking as a group now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night what happened,” Tsumugi says. “Is the killer sent Gonta a threatening note.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was probably in his lab,” Ryoma says quietly. “That was the last place I saw him that night…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So then Gonta went up to the fourth floor!” Angie says. “And went into the middle room with the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then…” Tenko frowns. “Gonta just stood in the box for Himiko’s sword trick?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe the killer told him they were going to rehearse for Himiko’s magic show…” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the culprit took the opportunity to stab him,” Tenko says. “With… something. Himiko’s swords are innocent, though!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“None of that makes sense,” Ryoma says. “If they threatened him, he wouldn’t just stand in some place that was blatantly dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” says Angie. “But isn’t that were Gonta was killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then the killer did something with the murder weapon,” says Tsumugi. “I think…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, that’s it,” says Kaede. “I think there’s a good chance that Gonta was killed somewhere else and moved later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “Moving Gonta? The killer must be really, really strong!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” says Maki. “But if the body was moved, the killer would have had all night to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So they took breaks in moving the body?” Angie asks. “God thinks that isn’t very efficient.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” says Miu. “Back the fuck up—if big dick wasn’t shanked in pancake tits’s death trap, then where the fuck was he killed!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “It seems Miu doesn’t know even though she has all the evidence…” he pouts, looking down sadly. “I guess she really is an idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’m j-just testing all of you!” Miu shouts. “I know <i>exactly</i> what happened!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems to be ignoring their exchange, lost in thought, and he says aloud, “The only other logical place I can think of would be…” he frowns. “Under the floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu jumps. “Wh-Wh-WHAT!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t you just fucking say you knew what happened?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Under the—!” Miu flails wildly. “I was under the fucking floor!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right, that’s right,” Angie says. “Maybe that means Miu knows something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi places a finger to his lips. “Maybe it means she’s the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-You!” Miu thrusts a finger in his direction. “You’re the whole fucking reason I was in that shit hole in the first place!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito huffs. “I’m guessin’ Kokichi left that part outta his explanation. Anyone wanna fill me in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki adds, “Preferably anyone who is not Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck you!” Miu shouts. “I’m the victim here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “When we were investigating, Kiibo pulled up some floorboards that were cut loose, and we found Miu under the floor between the middle room and the ritual room. Apparently,” she shoots a glare in Kokichi’s direction, “Kokichi tricked her into locking herself in the ritual room last night. Miu was missing for most of the investigation because she was trapped under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the room,” Kokichi corrects with a huff. “Miu crawled under the floor like a cockroach all on her own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Cockroach!?” Miu repeats. “S-So I’m a fucking cockroach now? J-Just like a bug u-under your feet?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She begins to sweat, face flushing pink, and Kiibo hesitantly says, “Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I, um, I don’t think I’d ask if I were you, Kiibo,” Tsumugi advises.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, wait,” says Kaito. “I think I got something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I doubt it,” Kokichi says. “Kaito’s about as smart as Miu…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko intervenes before anyone can start yelling at him. “Kaito, please do not engage with his insults and state what you think. If it is useless, we will tell you after you have said it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thanks for the fucking vote of confidence,” he says rolling his eyes. “Alright, so this probably isn’t related to what happened to Gonta, but if Miu was stuck under the floor all morning, doesn’t that mean she’s got an alibi for, like, the entire blackout?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She does…” Kaede says, suddenly realizing something. “Which means the only people who couldn’t have killed Himiko are me, Miu, and Kokichi…” she stares at him as Kokichi smiles back at her, almost daring her to put the pieces together. “Because Kokichi trapped Miu upstairs and handcuffed himself to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko adds, “When Tenko and Kaede went to the fourth floor this morning, Kokichi was already there. He immediately went about handcuffing himself to Kaede and claimed he did not have the key.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Angie, “did someone steal Kokichi’s keys, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Because Kokichi lied about that. When he finally took the handcuffs off, it turned out that he had the key with him the whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So he fucking did it for fun?” Kaito asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Maki says. “You just said Kokichi had the keys with him—doesn’t that mean you could have separated at any time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I only found out he was hiding the keys later,” Kaede says. “And we can both vouch for each other that we were together the entire time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As if Kokichi’s word means anything,” Maki says. “The point is—neither of you have alibis for Himiko’s murder, and the fact that you lied is suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t lie!” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That’s right. There is absolutely no way Kaede would lie, and there is no way she would ever hurt Himiko! Tenko believes in her and will fight for her, no matter what.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But can you be sure she’s not the killer?” Angie asks, expression suddenly dark.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks taken aback. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Tenko,” Angie says. “God thinks it’s super nice that you believe in Kaede, but what if she really did kill Himiko or Gonta, you know? If you keep believing in her then, won’t we all die here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without hesitation, Tenko says, “Tenko would rather die than stop believing in her friends. Tenko knows… Tenko knows that someone here murdered Himiko… and that she is never coming back, but hating and mistrusting everyone isn’t the answer. Even if horrible things happen, Tenko will still believe in her friends, and she will do everything that she can to protect them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself near speechless, and every lie she’s told thus far twists in her stomach. She breathes out, “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Kaede is someone who learns from her mistakes and wants to move forward—killing someone and sacrificing everyone is completely out of the question for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi regards her impassioned words coolly, and Kaede feels a brief rush of fear when he opens his mouth. But he says, “Kaede’s not the culprit. If you think either of us would lie for each other, you’re pretty stupid, Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns a gaze of pure death on him. “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs blandly. “If you want to be executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki seems on the verge of physically leaving her podium to attack him, when Kaito cuts in, “Alright, alright—everyone calm the hell down.” He runs a hand through his hair, mumbling, “Why the fuck do I have to be the levelheaded one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo decides to refocus the conversation. “Ah, Kaede, if you not mind me asking this now, earlier you seemed to realize something about Himiko’s death, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… did,” Kaede answers warily, fiddling with the brim of Shuichi’s hat as she debates what she can actually tell them. “Ah, it’s… a bit complicated to explain.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “We’re at a fucking trial for a reason—spit it out, blimp tits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at her. “I was just thinking about why she was killed. I think it’s safe to say that almost everyone knew that someone else had been killed, even if they didn’t know who, during the blackout.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “I remember hearing part of the body announcement playing right before the lights went out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the question is,” Kaede says. “Why would someone—the culprit or anyone else—kill a second person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki seems to take a pause in her accusations to consider the question, saying, “It is true that a second killing creates more evidence that can be used to track down the culprit. Doing so is inadvisable unless absolutely necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the killer thought it was necessary to bump her off?” Miu asks. “What was she a witness or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede considers this for a moment. “I think… that Himiko was involved somehow in Gonta’s death, but she was killed… probably for unrelated reasons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie blinks. “Huh? Himiko was involved in Gonta’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to hear more about that as well,” Ryoma says darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi chirps, “Then let’s all talk about it! C’mon! Some of you are dead weight, so put some effort into it! Quick one of you figure out the proof that Himiko was involved with Gonta’s death before Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just rolls her eyes as the others begin to talk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How the fuck,” Miu says, “Am I supposed to know shit about that!? I was under the floor the whole goddamn time!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I investigated under the floor before I became distracted by Miu,” Kiibo says. “I believe the major thing of note other than Miu’s presence there, was the large amount of blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We said some shit about Gonta bein’ killed under the floor, right?” Kaito says. “Maybe Himiko was killed down there, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Impossible. I was there for almost the entire blackout—never saw her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “Did the killer go after Himiko during the blackout because she saw something at the crime scene?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then they would’ve killed her that night,” Maki asks. “Her time of death was during the blackout. If you even bothered to read the Monokuma File, you should know that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko’s death sounds so horrible,” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “Being strangled… what a horrible way to die…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quietly, Tenko says, “her killer likely did it because it would not leave bloodstains. If they had run into someone during the blackout while covered in blood… then there would be no doubt what they had done…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sighs. “You’re all useless. Just tell ‘em, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was under the floor,” Miu mumbles. “What do you fucking want from me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The bloodstain,” Kaede says. “That’s the clue that Himiko was at the scene of the crime and probably that she touched Gonta’s body at some point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Ryoma breathes out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The Monokuma File said that she had no injuries other than those to her neck, which wouldn’t have caused her to bleed,” Kaede says. “But when we were investigating her body, we noticed a spot of blood behind one of her ears.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “<i>I</i> noticed it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My point,” Kaede says, “is that if that blood doesn’t belong to Himiko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was Gonta’s…” Tenko says quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” says Kaito. “But how does blood get behind someone’s fucking ear?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think she got drenched in it,” Kaede says. “During the investigation, Kokichi and I went to Himiko’s room. There… wasn’t much there,” she says, “but in her closet, we found a change of her clothes that were soaked with blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I think I understand. If almost her entire body was covered with blood, she likely washed it off and missed a spot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe that’s why parents always tell their children to wash behind their ears…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Tenko’s gonna get fucking pissed at me for saying this, but Himiko was covered in Gonta’s blood at some point and the murder happened in a room she was hanging out in last night? Are we sure she’s not the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already confirmed she wasn’t with Monokuma,” Kokichi says, puffing his cheeks out. “Geeze, Kaito, you never listen to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says Monokuma might have lied to protect her,” Angie says. “Sometimes he does things like that even though God doesn’t appreciate it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why would he protect a culprit who’s dead?” Maki says. “Monokuma just wants his game to be interesting—I doubt executing a corpse would fit that description.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks near ready to throw a fit, stamping his tiny foot chanting, “No, no, no! Come on! Think about Kaede and Tenko’s story from earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “When they found the body? The fuck does that have to do with Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “Himiko wasn’t there, correct? So according to Kaede’s testimony, the people who discovered Gonta’s body were Tenko, Kokichi, and Kaede, herself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu was also apparently there,” Tenko volunteers. “Though we did not know that at the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Miu. “And I didn’t see shit ‘til I woke up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “Miu, I don’t think you’re the killer, but I still can’t believe you just took a nap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already told you, it’s nice and dark and shit down there!” Miu says. “And I wouldn’t have fucking done it if I knew there was a corpse just lying around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right, so,” says Kokichi. “Miu doesn’t know anything like usual, so she didn’t find the body, but who did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko did,” Kaede says. “After she discovered it, the body announcement went off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s head snaps to her. “Wait. You weren’t all together when you found the body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Kokichi and I were in a different room. I think we already went over that Tenko was alone with it for a few seconds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Tenko did nothing to disturb the crime scene,” she answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki mutters to herself, “So that’s what Kokichi’s getting out. Monokuma,” she turns to address the bear. “I have a question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he asks. “What is it now? More technicalities that I’ve already explained that need clearing up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just answer me,” she says. “The rule for the body announcement is that three or more people need to discover a corpse, correct? Does the killer count as one of those people?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sometimes they do,” Monokuma says. “And sometimes they don’t! I make the call to keep things as fair as a bear can make them!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares at him, but says, “Fine. But either way, two people discovered Gonta’s body before Tenko. And I think we’ve confirmed one of them has to be Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko…” Tenko breathes out. “She—why didn’t she say anything? She was acting strange this morning, was it because…” Tenko presses her hands to her face. “Why didn’t she say anything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, so,” Tsumugi says hesitantly. “Does that mean that the people Monokuma’s counting for the body discovery are Tenko, Himiko, and one other person who might be the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand over his face. “If they’re the killer, I get it if they kept quiet, but if they’re not, does that mean two fucking people found a corpse and said nothing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu slams both her hands on her podium. “I told you! I fucking told you!” she jabs a finger in Kokichi’s direction. “One in the fucking morning, and <i>he’s</i> prancing around the fourth floor like the goddamn sugar plum fairy!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond, and Kaede looks at him searchingly as she says, “Kokichi was already on the fourth floor when Tenko and I arrived. It was like he was waiting for us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at him with dead eyes. “Miu said the door to the room he trapped her in was already open, which means he was able to pick the locks she sent up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that would explain the locked room, too,” Tsumugi mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh!” says Angie. “And the threatening note! Gonta probably didn’t trust Kokichi anymore after the bug appreciation party incident!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Kaito says. “This is just me guessing—but doesn’t stabbing the statues with swords sound like the kind of shit Kokichi would do just to mess with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “The reason why he handcuffed himself to Kaede before the blackout finally makes sense. He did it so he’d be one of the only people with an alibi for Himiko’s death.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “That would mean Kokichi would have had to have known the blackout would occur and that Himiko would be killed during it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he set that up, too,” Ryoma says. “If Himiko was a witness, maybe her death was some pre-setup trap or something he could activate without having to actually be there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Kokichi does like playing pranks—God says it would make sense for him to know how to set something like that up…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu stands looking more triumphant than ever, and slams her hands on her podium in time with her words. “I. Fucking. Told. You.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi remains silent, even as his podium moves to the center of the room for everyone to level their accusations at him. In the eye of the storm, he seems completely calm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at the back of his head, wandering what could possibly be going through his mind as the other continue to condemn him into whatever grave he’s made for himself. The anger and bitterness she had felt towards him only moments before the trial had begun fades away as she keeps watching him, his every action during the investigation running through her mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Were the words he said and the things he did actions of a killer? Looking back, his hand had guided almost every part of the investigation, but. She bites her lip. She had done the same thing only two days after the game’s beginning.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">While Kaede struggles, Kokichi seems almost bored and interrupts Miu’s tirade against him to say, “So—this is a rather convenient conclusion to come to, isn’t it? I doubt this means anything to any of you, but I have to wonder what happens to the game if I die here. I’ve certainly made enough enemies with enough people—one person in particular—that there’s a chance things could fall apart for the sake of revenge.” He hums. “I’d say this is that person’s trap, but,” he grins, folding his hands behind his head. “I brought most of this on myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You brought it on your dumbass because you’re the killer,” Miu snarls.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “What you’re saying—is this your confession or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shakes his head. “No. More like,” he pauses in thought briefly. “More like a warning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quietly, Kaede can’t help but ask, “Warning against what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He turns to her, a knowing smile on his face. “Figured you’d be the one to ask. Just a warning that if I die here and the rules break again, this killing game will end exactly how it was intended to.” He winks at her. “That’s all. You’re pretty smart, Kaede. I’m sure you’ll figure it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at him in near shock while her mind races around his words, searching for the answers hidden and twisted somewhere, <i>anywhere</i> in his sunny expression.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Stop talking. Your empty threats don’t mean anything. They just show how desperate you are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” he says. “You should really stop talking like you know anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scowls, her red eyes fixed on him as she says, “Monokuma, I think we’re ready to vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede shouts almost involuntarily. The others turn to her, and she finds herself sweating under their stares. She falters, looking over them, and trips on her words, stuttering, “E-Everyone, please. There’s still so much about this case that we haven’t figured out. Voting for Kokichi—voting for anyone now—would be a huge mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu groans. “Again with this shit? Bakamatsu, come <i>on</i>.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Well, I think that should clear up any of our doubts. Gonta’s murder is open and shut then—Kokichi’s the killer, and Kaede is protecting him for some godforsaken reason. Again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What? Didn’t you hear what I just said?” Kaede grips the edges of her podium, desperation surging over her. “Why won’t any of you listen to me? I know there’s evidence against him, but,” she searches for anything, “but there’s too much we haven’t cleared up yet. And Kokichi helped me investigate the entire time, even,” she waves vaguely, “even pointing out stuff I missed. It makes no sense for him to be the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one responds to her, and in the following silence she says, “Why won’t you believe me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Look, Kaede,” Kaito says with a sigh. “I know you how you feel about condemning the killer, but c’mon. It fucking has to be him. Maybe he helped us out with the investigation and shit, but that doesn’t just cancel out the mountain of evidence against him, and,” he sends a glance towards Ryoma, “I think it’d be better if we didn’t drag this trial out, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The attention directed towards him isn’t lost on Ryoma, and he just pulls his hat down. “If we have our answer,” he says in a low voice. “Then we should just end this already…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” says Miu. “Does that mean we’re starting the fucking vote or what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” shouts Kaede. “If you all vote for Kokichi, we’re going to die!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know, I have to agree with Kaede,” Kokichi says conversationally, finally coming to his own defense. “But, the idea that I’m the culprit sure is a comforting lie. I can see why you all like it so much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” says Ryoma. “Just shut up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the uneasy silence following his words, Angie says, “Sooo, does that mean we should vote now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Ryoma. “I’m done listening to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” shouts Kaede. “Ryoma, I know how you feel, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bullshit,” says Ryoma, his voice crueler than Kaede has ever heard it before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think you get it because Shuichi died?” he says. “Is that it? You knew him for two days. You knew him, and you knew you had other people around you. You still have your family, your friends on the outside,” he gestures to Kaito, standing two podiums away, “hell, you have friends in here. So no, you don’t understand how I feel, and watching you defend Gonta’s killer makes me sick.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself speechless other than breathing out, “Ryoma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Hey, Ryoma, don’t you think that was kind of harsh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma ignores him. “Monokuma, I’m ready to vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kokichi. “My, what a tragic turn of events. It looks like Gonta’s sacrifice will all be for nothing then.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought I told you to shut up,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, please,” says Kiibo. “Even though you are still grieving, Kaito was right. Please do not speak so harshly to your fellow classmates. Kaede,” he turns to her. “I am aware that you do not think Kokichi is the culprit, and though I would like to discover the truth behind the other mysteries in this case myself, I believe that if only the two of you are against voting now, we cannot have a debate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede works her mouth uselessly to find the right words before saying, “No… no one else thinks we should keep talking? I know things look bad for Kokichi, but like Kiibo said, there are still mysteries we haven’t solved yet. There <i>has</i> to be more to this case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence follows, and Kaede pleads, “I’ll debate with you or hear your arguments, and if Kokichi is the culprit then, I’ll vote for him, but right now, I’m begging you all not to do this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">More silence as her classmates idly trade skeptical looks, and Kaede hears her heart roaring in her ears, until one voice rings out.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… Tenko didn’t investigate Gonta’s body… and she doesn’t have proof that Kokichi’s innocent, but,” she takes a deep breath, steadying herself. “Tenko also does not think he did it. Even though Kokichi is one of the worst boys Tenko has ever met, she knows he would never kill someone. So Tenko will argue on Kaede’s side.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Yay! Tenko also doesn’t want to die!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares at him as Kaede clears her throat, turning to address Monokuma. “So,” she says. “I know it’s uneven, but is three versus seven good enough for a debate?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I would also all like to continue our discussion. I will argue on Kaede’s side.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shoots him a relived smile. “Thanks, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Aw, Kiiboy’s one of the people who likes me? Boo…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma tilts his furry head. “Hmm, so four against six? A bit lopsided certainly, but my mother did always tell me to turn a blind eye to one’s imperfections, soooo,” he holds the key high over his head, “here we gooooo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grips the edges of her podium to steady herself as they all begin to lift into the air. She looks across the way at Ryoma who stares at her, nearly boiling over with his own frustration and hatred over the situation. The others lined up on his side all bear their own expressions of various degrees of aggravation and annoyance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a deep breath and meets Ryoma’s hardened gaze with her own fierce determination. Standing strong, however, is not her biggest concern, as Kaede numbly thinks just how little proof she has to prove her point. Kokichi’s standing next to her, as unconcerned as ever and simply smiles back when he catches her staring at him out of the corner of her eye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma starts talking, his first words dulled into nothing over the roaring in her ears as she decides the only way out of this and towards the truth of the case is to lie her heart out.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Actually back to posting on a Saturday! I've been casually rewatching DR1 and 2 to get a feel for trials in general, so if you see anything that seems like a reference to the first two games, it probably is, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">If she lies, Kaede realizes, Tenko will follow along, Kokichi will be too amused to protest, and Kiibo will be confused. Her eyes dart to Kokichi standing next to her, smiling as if he wasn’t staring his execution dead in the face. She looks back to Ryoma and straightens her hat forward.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(BEGIN)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p12"><span class="s1">Ryoma starts, “Every piece of evidence in this case points to Kokichi. We have no reason to suspect anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo is the first to respond to him, “Though there may be some evidence, we have not discussed everything enough to declare Kokichi is the only person capable of being the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts, “He basically fucking admitted he found the body! Only the killer would keep quiet about shit like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi likely had other reasons for not telling us,” Tenko answers. “And he did not attempt to stop us from discovering it this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He already confessed to being on the fourth floor that night,” Kaito says. “And it’s really fucking suspicious that he’d trap Miu up there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “There’s nothing that proves my playing a trick on Miu’s related to the murder at all, especially since she doesn’t know anything about the case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi mumbles, “how else are we supposed to explain the locked room? Kokichi is the only person who could have gotten in…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees her opportunity. “This morning, Himiko told us she lost her keys—the killer probably found them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “But the crime scene was really weird. God says only someone like Kokichi would do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is not evidence,” Kiibo says. “Though Kokichi likes pranks, we cannot assume he did that without real proof.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s highly suspicious that Kokichi set himself up to be one of the only people with an alibi during the blackout,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quickly counters, “Suspicious or not, an alibi is an alibi, and,” she chances a look towards him, “Kokichi was just as surprised about the blackout as anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just glares. “We already have enough information to conclude this case. Stop pretending otherwise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares back. “Himiko’s death is just as important as Gonta’s. If we vote now, we will never find justice for her, and <i>Tenko will never allow that!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They descend, and Ryoma doesn’t say a word, simply glaring at some aimless spot in front of him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko repeats, “Until we discover why Himiko had to die, Tenko refuses to vote for anyone.” She turns to address everyone. “Deciding to vote now because it’s convenient is an insult to both Himiko and Gonta. If we were truly their friends, then we wouldn’t stop fighting until we find the absolute truth about what happened to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck…” Kaito sighs. “Fine, I get it. I have no fucking clue who else it could be, but… guess there’s always a chance it’s not Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just hums. “Hmm, I agree. Tenko makes a nice point, but I have a feeling she’s going to be disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means he’s still suspicious as fuck,” Miu answers, eyes narrowed. “Listen here, ass clown, just ‘cause we’re not executing you yet doesn’t mean you’re innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Man,” Kokichi sighs. “Some people just get so hung up on the lies they like best. It’s kind of sad…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop talking,” Maki snaps. “And stop trying to weasel out of this, especially since there’s still holes in your argument, or more specifically,” she turns her glare on Kaede, “Kaede’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites back the fear that immediately seizes her. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said Himiko didn’t have the keys to get into the three rooms this morning,” Maki says. “So how did you and Tenko get in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pales, but manages to stammer out, “I-I already said that Kokichi was there with us. He unlocked the doors.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Kokichi says brightly, folding his arms behind his head. “Himiko already told me she lost her keys, so I was waiting up there to let Kaede and Tenko in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma finally speaks up. “Himiko told you to let them in? You?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “Is it really that hard to believe? It’s the truth…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Now that you’ve said that, I’m having trouble believing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts sniffling. “Kaito has no faith in me… and I thought he believed in everyone even though that’s really stupid…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God, do I still hope you’re the killer,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “If we may, now that we’ve decided to put off the vote, there are a few things I would like to discuss further, such as what Himiko’s involvement in the case was, particularly if Kokichi was telling the truth just now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko would like to know that as well,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “Well, um, are we still assuming Kokichi discovered the body last night? Before Miu went to the fourth floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whether we are,” Maki says with a pointed look to Kaede, “doesn’t seem to be up to us but we should.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means,” Kaito quickly cuts in. “Tenko, Himiko, and Kokichi were the first three people, not counting the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Tenko found Gonta this morning, Kokichi likely sometime before the… incident with Miu, which would be between midnight and one in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, Angie remembers that Kokichi likes to lurk around the fourth floor at night,” Angie says. “Sooooo God thinks he probably found it sometime then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “You were actually being serious when you said you liked creeping around in the dark at night…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course!” Kokichi says. “Would I lie to you, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pinches the bridge of his nose, while Kaede says, “Which means the only one we don’t know the time for is Himiko, other than it had to be before this morning when Tenko and I went to the fourth floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we saw Himiko this morning,” Tenko steps into clarify, “she was coming downstairs from the fourth floor. She said we should go upstairs to help prepare for her magic show, and that she… needed to do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “She didn’t happen to mention what it was, did she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “And unless anyone here can say otherwise, I don’t think anyone saw her after that either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Angie saw reeeeally Himiko early this morning in the cafeteria. Angie was just making tea and Himiko came to get some since she said she was really tired.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do remember you mentioning seeing her,” Kaede says. “Did she say or do anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Angie says. “All Himiko said was that she just woke up and was going to prepare for her magic show super early. She was really nervous, so she gave Angie a big hug before leaving and said goodbye! Sooo God thinks that Himiko probably discovered Gonta after that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh? The fuck do you think that for?” Miu asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because Himiko didn’t mention anything to Angie,” Angie says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if she discovered the body, she probably would’ve said something, huh?” Kaito says, frowning. “But she didn’t say anything to Kaede or Tenko, either right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “I think this is a nice first step in figuring out what role Himiko played in this case. So, Kaede—you seem to be doing most of the heavy lifting anyway—care to point out what the answer is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him, but the other continue to talk in the background even as Kokichi smiles at whatever game he’s playing with her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This morning, Angie saw Himiko really early!” Angie says. “She said she was going up to the fourth floor, so she probably discovered Gonta’s body right after that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What time was that approximately?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm… God says it was about half past six,” Angie says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Morning announcements are at seven-thirty,” Tenko says. “Tenko and Kaede saw Himiko immediately after the one for today played.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says everyone else should have been getting up at that time, too,” Angie says. “Since that’s when curfew ends for non-student council members.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So our timeline is,” Kiibo says, “Himiko discovered the body this morning after speaking with Angie but before running into Kaede and Tenko, and no one else saw her before the blackout.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands over her head. “God says that as long as Himiko didn’t go back to the dorms, then she wouldn’t have had to worry about running into anyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She also likely saw Kokichi this morning,” Tenko says. “Though Tenko is doubtful that helps us pin down a timeframe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “It always fucking comes back to Kokichi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins, folding his hands behind his head. “I’m pretty important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, Angie,” Kaede says. “Himiko definitely returned to her room after discovering the body. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Angie asks. “But if Himiko tried to go to her room this morning, then God says that everyone totally would have seen her.” She hums, “Kaede, are you saying everyone is lying about seeing her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” Kaede says, mildly taken aback. “I’m saying that I have evidence that shows Himiko went back to her room sometime between discovering the blackout and this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She mentioned it earlier,” Maki says. “Kaede said she and Kokichi went to Himiko’s room during the investigation and found bloody clothes, which are the entire reason we’re even assuming Himiko was involved in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I see. Whatever interaction Himiko had with the crime scene resulted in her being covered in blood, and unless anyone witnessed her returning to her room in such a state, we can assume she did not do it this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito, “Says I was in the dorms all fucking morning. Never saw her or anyone else covered in blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “Of course you never saw anyone. You were in your room sleeping.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I still didn’t see or hear anyone after everyone left when the morning announcement went off,” Kaito says. “And I think someone running around covered in blood would probably attract some yelling.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And all of that,” Kaede says. “Means we can safely assume Himiko found the body before this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does that mean she just… decided not to tell anyone?” Tsumugi asks. “Why would she keep something like that secret?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wrong,” Maki says. “Kokichi already said Himiko told him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wrong!” Kokichi cheers. “I said Himiko told me to let Kaede and Tenko into the death room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma finally speaks up again. “So the two of you were working together,” he says in a frighteningly quiet voice. “Is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Angie tilts her head to the side. “Who was working together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “If we’re to believe even half the things Kokichi has said—which admittedly is a risk—then we can assume that there is definitely a connection between Himiko’s involvement in Gonta’s death and his.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am unsure what that connection would be,” Kiibo says. “However, I do find it difficult to believe that both of them would discover a body and choose to say nothing without any communication between them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the loli and the shota were working together,” Miu says. “How ‘bout this then—one of ‘em was the killer and the other was their accomplice. And then!” she jabs a finger at Kokichi, “during the blackout the fucking ass gremlin bumped Himiko off to keep her quiet!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi yawns. “Geeze, Miu, how slow can you be? We already decided it’s not me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We didn’t,” Maki snaps. “We just decided to figure out exactly how guilty you are before executing you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Fine, fine.” He yawns again, rubbing at his eyes. “Man, I’m getting so bored. We’ve talked for so long, and we’re still going in circles. Maybe I should give you guys a hint or something to speed things along…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him skeptically. “What kind of hint?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fact that he’s even giving hints is fucking suspicious!” Miu shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito says. “Kokichi withholding information ‘cause he thinks it’s funny or some shit is nothing new.” He looks to him. “Just tell us already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head. “Will you say please?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Kokichi, will you please—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “I wasn’t asking you,” and his eyes practically sparkle when he turns to Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Oh, fuck no. Kaede, we can do this without him, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s a really good hint!” Kokichi says. “Don’t you want to be everyone’s hero, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cackles, “Looks like we know what shota gets off on now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi scowls, and Kaito’s eyes dart between the two of them before he says, “How about I hit Miu later instead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Deal!” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What!?” Miu squawks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu!” Kokichi says. “Shut up! I need to tell everyone that I talked to Himiko before I saw you last night!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Did you just… give us the time frame for the incident? Just like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For the discoveries anyway,” Maki says. “It would seem he did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles brightly. “I like to be helpful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now that’s a fucking lie,” Kaito grumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kiibo says. “Kokichi came to your lab at one last night, correct? Did you see anyone else when you went up the fourth floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” she stutters. “I-I mean, yeah, Kokichi started banging on my door at one in the fucking morning, but I didn’t see anyone else last night ‘sides him.” She frowns. “Also none of you assholes showed up when I screamed for help either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Himiko was working with Kokichi,” Ryoma sighs. “She probably knew that trapping Miu was part of his plan…” he shakes his head. “Whatever the hell his stupid plan was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares at the ground. “But why? Why would Himiko agree to work with Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said!” Miu shouts. “Killer and accomplice! What the fuck else do you need?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A reason why anyone would agree to such an arrangement,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “It’s in Monokuma’s shitty rules that only person can graduate, right? The hell would anyone work together then?” He glances to Kokichi who beams back. “Also why the hell would anyone work with <i>Kokichi</i>?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think the whys of this case will have to come later,” Maki says. “Especially since I doubt Kokichi’s about to start talking anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “But Kokichi just talked. He told us the timeframe and that he was working with Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Angie. “God says that sure is a lot for Kokichi to come just come out and say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki begins fiddling with her hair in a poor attempt to hide her embarrassment while Kokichi laughs. “Looks like Maki needs to pay more attention instead of just saying things she thinks will make her look cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I was doing,” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi waves his hand. “Sure, sure, whatever.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “If no one minds, there is another question I would like to ask regarding the idea that Himiko and Kokichi were working together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking ask it, Kiibs,” Miu says. “Got to be better than listening to shota fucking go on and on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kiibo says. “If Himiko and Kokichi were working together last night between Gonta’s time of death at midnight and Tenko’s discovery this morning, why do we only have evidence that Himiko was covered in blood?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I get it,” says Kaito. “What do you say Kokichi? You get sprayed with blood, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Distantly, Ryoma just sighs, as Kokichi sticks out his tongue. “No! That’d be really gross, and blood stains white clothes really badly, right Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares. “What that the hell is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “It’s okay. We can talk about your incident in the cafeteria this morning later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede senses the shouting match on the tip of Kaito’s tongue, and quickly cuts in, “We only know Himiko was covered in blood at some point because we found some on her and a set of her clothes that were bloody.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” says Tsumugi. “Did anyone go to Kokichi’s room during the investigation?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Anyone dig through Kokichi’s closet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Actually, yes. Kokichi told me the key to the handcuffs was in his room so we went there after searching Himiko’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki frowns. “Earlier you said Kokichi had the key with him the whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I also said he lied about that,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Soooo,” Angie says. “If Kokichi lied, does that mean he wanted Kaede to go to his room with him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doubt it,” Miu says. “I’ll fucking shove this podium up my ass if shota swings that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The point is,” Kaede says. “I went to Kokichi’s room with him and actually saw the inside of his closet, and there wasn’t anything even remotely bloody in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede and Kokichi were also walking around together for most of the day,” Tenko adds. “Kaede likely would have noticed in Kokichi had blood anywhere on him like Himiko did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “Maybe Kokichi just washed it off really well? Ooh, or God thinks maybe he just hid his clothes somewhere else like the bathroom.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it matters,” Tsumugi adds. “I actually went to Kirumi’s lab this morning to try and do laundry, and I didn’t see Kokichi’s or anyone else’s clothes while I was there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrivels up her nose in disgust. “Eww. Does that mean no one’s been washing their clothes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not the point,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cackles. “Well that fucking answers that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Hey!” Kaito shouts. “I fucking do laundry sometimes!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He has to,” Kokichi says brightly. “Otherwise Kaito would run out of stuff not covered in blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito growls, “I thought I told you to shut the fuck up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “You didn’t. At least not recently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What happened to Kaito this morning has nothing to do with the cases,” Kaede says firmly. “Kokichi, if you want to talk about it with him, you can do it later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s grin stretches uncomfortably far. “Oh, I plan to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grits his teeth. “Kaede,” he barks. “Just keep the conversation moving, alright? What do we need to talk about next?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, Kaede!” Kokichi says. “Do everything! Kaito needs your help!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite the many times Kaede has seen the two go back and forth, there’s an anger lining Kaito’s words that she hasn’t heard before. “I don’t!” he shouts. “I just—! Kaede,” he yells again, “Himiko was covered in blood—Kokichi wasn’t. Why the fuck is that important?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki answers before her. “It means between the two of them, only Himiko ever touched the body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s true,” Kaede says. “But there’s still more questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like how the fuck you get blood behind your ear from doing a corpse?” Miu asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Ryoma snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu recoils. “I-I-I’m just a-asking ‘cause it’s w-weird, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “It is. And it also makes me wonder what the purpose in touching the body was in the first place. Also, if we are to assume Kokichi is not the culprit, then I would like to know what the killer’s timeframe was in setting up the scene of the crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets in place. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We have already established that the crime scene was setup in a very specific way,” Kiibo says. “And that even for the strongest of us here, moving someone as heavy as Gonta would likely be a feat that would take a great amount of time in order to accomplish due to the sheer labor required.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Angie tilts her head. “Is something wrong with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe there is,” Kiibo says. “Kokichi brought Miu to the fourth floor an hour after Gonta’s time of death, meaning he discovered the body before then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“From what we have discussed, Himiko probably found Gonta’s body around then, as well,” Tenko says, still staring at the ground. “And it is likely the killer would have done something to silence them if they had noticed either of Himiko or Kokichi after committing their crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means we can assume the killer left the crime scene before then,” Kaede says, furrowing her brow. “And that also means they had less than an hour to set everything up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “I think this mystery might be my very favorite of this case. So, Kaede,” he shoots her a beaming smile, “do your best, and don’t be boring!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Based on Kokichi’s testimony,” Kiibo says. “The killer set up the crime scene in less than one hour last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh!” says Angie. “God says they must be really, really fast!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or really strong, right?” says Tsumugi. “Because they had to move Gonta’s body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi’s a fucking freak,” Kaito says, “and was probably already wandering around on the fourth floor right when the crime scene was being setup.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head to one side. “So then Kokichi hid from the killer?” and the other. “Or did the killer hide from Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko was also likely there,” Tenko says softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the killer hid from them both!” Angie announces.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the middle of setting up the fucking crime scene?” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The idea that the killer was still on the fourth floor when Miu arrived is hard to believe,” says Kiibo. “Perhaps they came back to set up the crime scene after she fell into Kokichi’s trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the culprit returned to the scene of the crime after Himiko, Kokichi, and Miu discovered what they had done,” Maki says dully, “and didn’t see any of them or do anything about Miu even though she was literally yelling from the next room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Admittedly that is unlikely…” Kiibo stutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says the culprit is really fast, then!” Angie concludes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “That’s it. The culprit had already left by the time Miu came to the fourth floor. In fact, they probably had left to go back to their room for the night before Kokichi showed up either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re saying the killer actually did return to the scene of the crime?” Maki asks. “And they failed to notice three potential witnesses?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No, I’m saying I think the simplest solution is the answer. The people who set up the crime scene were the people who were on the fourth floor and had all night to do it: Himiko and Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very slowly, Ryoma says, “It wasn’t… the killer didn’t…” he shakes his head, words seeming to fail him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Hesitantly, Tenko says, “Is that why Himiko was covered in blood? Was she the one who moved the body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs again. “Kokichi probably could have helped her, too, without getting covered in blood. Gonta’s… Gonta’s stab wound mostly only got the front of his shirt bloody. If you focused only on pulling him by his arms or his side… you could do it.” He shrugs, blandly fiddling with the cigarette in his hands and staring someplace far away. “His blood was dry this morning, but that’s how I moved him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Ryoma’s looking pretty clean, huh?” Kokichi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo still has his hand to his mouth, thinking deeply. “If we also continue our assumption that they had all night, there is also the possibility that they could have waited for the blood to dry a bit before attempting to move him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay,” Kaito says waving his hands. “I get your reasoning and shit, but can we not ignore that this is fucking insane!? I never went there, but literally everyone has said how fucking weird the crime scene was, and now we’re assuming two people who <i>aren’t</i> the culprit did it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is rather strange when you put it that way…” Tsumugi says. “Moving the body, stabbing the statues with the swords… did the killer really do neither of those things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu slams a hand on her podium. “How many times do I have to tell you assholes!? Kokichi literally did fucking everything in big dick’s murder! How in the <i>fuck</i> is he not the killer!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I’m not!” Kokichi says. “Geeze, Miu, you sound like a broken record.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “I’m going to ask you this straight out, and I expect a real answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A poor thing to do when it comes to him,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede ignores her, focusing her attention solely on Kokichi. “Did you or did you not set up Angie’s statues and stab them with Himiko’s swords?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s the part you’re concerned about?” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kaede says, snapping her head to face the other girl. “The statues weren’t in the ritual room by the time you got locked in there, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right…” she says slowly. “I woulda tired using one as a battering ram and thrust the head into the do—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, Kokichi,” Kaede turns her attention back to him. “I need an answer right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “Well, it’s hard to answer because you’re asking me two different questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she’s not?” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi waves a dismissive hand in his direction. “Hey, Kaito, why don’t you sit this one out and let someone who actually knows what they’re saying do the talking, hmm?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut the fuck up,” Kaito growls. “Are you trying to say that only you and Kaede know anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I’m saying…” Kokichi says tilting his head. “But it is true.” He shrugs and gives Kaito a bland look. “Sorry, Kaito, you’re nice to look at, but you’re not really much of a hero, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Kaito doesn’t bite back at him but instead seems genuinely taken off guard. Maki snaps, “Stop insulting him for your own amusement. It’s tiring and it gets us nowhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine then,” Kokichi says before turning back to Kaede. “And to answer your question, Kaede, no and yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is not a real answer,” Tenko says. “And Kaede specifically asked you to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I heard her,” he says, rolling his eyes. “And I answered. No and yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Fine. At least you admit you had a hand in setting up the crime scene. Chances are we aren’t going to find out a whole lot of whys in this case until we find the culprit, but,” she presses a hand to her forehead, “Kokichi what purpose did you possibly have in doing all of that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was probably just to make the crime more interesting,” Maki says. “I think we can all agree Kokichi enjoys doing idiotic things like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi giggles. “Man, Maki thinks she knows everything. It’s so funny!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then ignore her,” Kaede says, not missing the way Maki scowls at her, “and answer my question. I thought the crime scene was strange during the whole investigation because I couldn’t even begin to imagine how it would have helped the killer, but knowing someone other than the killer did it just makes things stranger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did it to help everyone,” Kokichi beams. “I wanted to give you guys a few hints. See, try imaging what the crime scene looked like before my help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What help?” Ryoma scoffs. “The only thing you’ve helped do is show us how much of a freak you are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hugs her arms to her chest. “To think someone’s enjoying the killing game so much to just toy with us like this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I think we should listen to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “You always wanna fucking listen to him. What got a crush on whiny, pasty, and emo number two?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at her darkly from under her hat. “Miu, I am actually very angry at you right now, but that isn’t important.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu wilts. “I-I just meant—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How the crime scene looked before Kokichi arrived,” Kiibo says, thinking aloud. “We still have not established why he was down there or how he was killed in such a position, but Gonta was under the floor, correct?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the statues Angie created would not have been there,” Tenko adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The room…” Ryoma says. “It… it would have been completely normal looking…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “Would we have even found the body?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… don’t know,” Kaede says. “What happens if someone’s killed, but we never discover their corpse?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There can’t be a class trial, right?” Kaito says finally. “Maybe… maybe the killer didn’t want to have a trial at all, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles proudly. “Aw, looks like Kaito has a brain in there somewhere, even if he still needs to rely on Kaede for everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sends him a tired glare but remains silent, other than mumbling, “Just shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Wait, does that mean Kokichi manipulated the crime scene to make us discover the body that means he wanted a class trial, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Miu says, seemingly recovered, “The gorgeous genius inventor Miu Iruma has a better question that you’re all probably pissing all over yourselves to hear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pauses dramatically, and after a moment of silence she nudges Kiibo’s shoulder, prompting him to ask, “What is your question, Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Glad you asked, Kiibs!” she says. “So, get this—big dick’s body is under the floor before the loli-shota duo arrive on the scene, yeah? Did they just decide to get down and dirty under the floor for no reason?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “That’s actually a really good point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-Don’t sound so surprised!” Miu shouts back. “I have lots of good points!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s voice is soft when she says, “Kokichi said he and Himiko worked together… Tenko has no idea why Himiko would agree to such a thing, but the fact that they did means that maybe one of them discovered Gonta’s body and… simply told the other?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That makes sense. Also, if they did work together, we probably shouldn’t assume they both found Gonta independently, especially given the original positioning of his body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie hums. “We keep talking about how Gonta was under the floor when he died, but God still doesn’t know why. Ooh,” she clasps her hands together, “and we don’t know how he was killed yet either!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we still have very few clues to explain why or how Himiko was killed later,” Kiibo adds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Her death is probably related to whatever plan she had with Kokichi,” Maki says. “In Kaede’s testimony, she said Himiko came down from the fourth floor where Kokichi was waiting for them to arrive. It’s likely the two had been planning something right up until that point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the second part of their plan resulted in Himiko’s death?” Tsumugi asks. “So even if Kokichi isn’t the culprit, did he still trick her into getting herself killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shouts, “That can’t be what happened! Because—because Himiko would never fall for a horrible boy’s awful—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what if it’s true?” Kokichi asks blankly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at him in shock as a sudden silence crashes over them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a moment of hesitation, Kaito manages to stutter, “I-Is that a confession? Like, for fucking real this time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kokichi giggles. “Geeze, you guys. Can’t you tell a lie when you hear one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re being suspected of murder,” Ryoma says. “You do realize that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Enough already!” Tenko yells. “Tenko is-is—is so <i>tired</i> of this.” She lets out a sigh and seems so exhausted as she shakes her head. “We have been arguing and yelling at each other for so long, and we are still no closer to figuring out why Himiko died than when we started.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede murmurs, “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Why do you have a problem? Kokichi clearly had a hand in Himiko’s death—defending him makes no logical sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko just shakes her head again. “Tenko is tired of lies and insults and everyone thinking of themselves,” she says, “and Tenko knows that Kokichi is hiding something, and she doesn’t know why. But she also knows that he would never kill anyone, and we are wasting time accusing him.” She takes a deep breath. “Tenko wants to find the truth in this trial so Gonta and Himiko can have justice—so their deaths will matter. If Tenko just fought and clawed at everyone for her own survival, then she would be no different than the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A new silence falls over the others, though one more of acceptance than discomfort. However, after a moment, Maki’s voice breaks the quiet again, “ignoring the platitudes,” she begins, and Kaede braces herself for whatever is to come next, “you keep saying you believe in Kokichi and that he wouldn’t kill someone. Why is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko falters. “T-Tenko just believes in him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, Tenko,” says Angie, “earlier you said you’d rather die than not believe in your friends, soooo is Kokichi your friend? Ooh, what if he killed Himiko—would he still be your friend then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi mercifully remains silent as Tenko says, “Tenko just knows that it is impossible for Kokichi to have committed this crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods hurriedly. “I agree. And,” she looks over Kokichi’s head to Tenko standing a few podiums away, “I also want to work with everyone to find justice for our friends. I think that’s really the only thing we can do.” Tenko smiles back at her, and Kaede turns to say, “So let’s turn our attention to Himiko’s case so we can finally get a fuller picture of her involvement and why the killer went after her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” says Tsumugi. “I mean, I want to find justice for my friends, too, but does Himiko’s case matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A fair point,” Maki says. “We only need to vote for whoever killed Gonta. Didn’t the two of you just go on and on about wasting time on unnecessary things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says. “Who gives a shit about which death we need to figure out?” He slams his fists together. “Fuck Monokuma’s rules—Himiko and Gonta are both fucking relying on us to find out what happened to them, and that’s what we’re going to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “Spoken like a real fake hero, Kaito. But anyway,” he ignores the scowl Kaito’s face morphs into, “why don’t we figure out Himiko’s cause of death? That should clear up most of Kaede’s questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not all of our questions?” Ryoma says lowly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Kokichi cheers. “Just Kaede’s!” He tilts his head to the side. “And maybe Miu’s, but I think she’s too stupid to get it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu rises to his provocation again, but Kaede ignores them, instead exchanging a shared supportive smile with Tenko before launching into the next debate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you know what Himiko was doing during the blackout,” Kokichi says. “Then you can figure out everything about her cause of death! It’s almost like you’re playing on easy mode after figuring that out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko’s cause of death,” Tsumugi says. “The Monokuma File said she was strangled, right? Is there anything else to that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It also said the killer used some sort of object!” Angie says. “Angie thinks it was a rope!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko investigated Himiko’s injuries,” Tenko says. “Whatever… whatever was wrapped around her neck was likely more solid and bulky than a rope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“More solid?” Kaito echoes. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “like something heavier.” She looks down at the ground, “something that would cut into her neck more…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A rope wouldn’t do that?” Tsumugi asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie steeples her hands. “Angie will pray for Himiko. Maybe her spirit can tell us what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, Kaito,” Kokichi chimes in, “is this the part where you say, ‘there are no ghosts and I’m super tough!’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at him. “Just shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko wrings her hands. “Maybe Tenko’s report was wrong and it was a rope…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God doesn’t know where the killer could find anything that wasn’t a rope,” Angie adds. “Even in the storage room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede chooses her words carefully as she speaks next. “Hey, Miu, before I go any further, I need you to do me a favor and think really carefully before you say anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I always think about the shit I say,” Miu answers, tossing her hair over her shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sends her a skeptical look. “Kaede, you’re really not doing yourself any favors in looking innocent right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can only sigh. “I know, but it really can’t be helped if… some of the details surrounding Himiko’s case are what I think they are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks at her with clear concern. Choosing her words deliberately, she says, “Tenko still believes in Kaede, but what about Himiko’s case do you and Miu need to be careful talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m really sorry,” Kaede says. “I’ll tell you later. But, if it’s alright, there’s a few questions I need to ask you about Himiko’s body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko suddenly looks uncomfortable but says, “Okay… Tenko went over what she knows already, but she will still try to answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you,” Kaede says. “We all know the Monokuma File says that the culprit used an object like a rope to kill her, but you said it was likely something harder and thicker, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, ignoring Miu snorting in the background. “That’s right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there any chance,” Kaede takes a deep breath, “that it could have been a bundle of cables?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares at her blankly for a moment. “Tenko… wouldn’t know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like,” Kaede gestures vaguely. “A bunch of cables all bound together. They’d be strong and thick and would probably leave an uneven pattern when they cut into someone’s neck. Himiko’s wounds looked something like that, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow. “That is true, but where did the culprit—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Suddenly Miu screams, “Oh shit! Oh shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Looks like Miu figured it out,” Kokichi hums.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m afraid I am not following,” Kiibo says. “If a bundle of cables was the weapon, does that mean Himiko was killed in the computer room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “I was upstairs during the whole investigation. If someone walked past me to go there during the blackout, I would’ve heard.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Ryoma definitely would have fucking heard if Himiko started fighting against her killer or something,” Kaito adds. “So if we’re assuming it was a bunch of cables…” he trails off. “Why are we assuming a bunch of cables was the murder weapon?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is mostly speculation, I admit,” Kaede says. “And I know you guys don’t have all the information I do, but I’m fairly certain Himiko was killed somewhere… specific.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “You can fucking say that again.” She snaps her fingers. “Hey! Any of you assholes see pancake during the blackout?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko searched the school for her,” Tenko says. “But… she was not able to find her or wherever she was being killed…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And quite unfortunately,” Kokichi says. “I already asked everyone when I was with Kaede, and it turns out we were the only two who were together the whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu quickly adds, “A-And we already said that I have an alibi and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki looks between them. “Funny that the only three people who seem to have any idea what’s going on are the only ones with alibis.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “I mean, not the suspecting you guys part, but like,” he rubs at the back of his head, “what the fuck is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “From… what I can follow, it seems Kaede, Miu, and Kokichi are all in agreement about the weapon used to kill Himiko, and its description does fit with Tenko’s autopsy report. However, why they are all so sure is… unclear, though it seems to have something to do with where Himiko was killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we don’t know where that was,” Tsumugi says. “Right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Tenko couldn’t find Himiko during the blackout,” Angie says, “God doesn’t think anyone could!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fidgets with Shuichi’s hat, internally struggling with what she can actually say aloud. Tenko’s far too concerned stare and voice softly calling out, “Kaede?” does nothing to help.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu decides to step in. “Wait one fucking second! The amazing archangel Miu Iruma just realized something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede regards her warily, debating even acknowledging her before saying, “Miu, remember what I said. Please think carefully…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves a hand dismissively at her. “Yeah, yeah—I got it. But,” she dramatically gestures to herself. “The only fucking people who should know anything about anything are me and Bakamatsu so why,” for perhaps the hundredth time that day Kaede absently thinks, Miu jabs an accusatory finger in Kokichi’s direction, “does he know anything!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “‘Cause I know everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Miu’s right. Why would you… and why would Himiko even know about that place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “Someone told someone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only people who should know…” Kaede says again, “are me, Miu, and the…” she trails off, glancing at the variety of confused and frustrated faces lining the court room. She swallows and makes a decision. “And the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A general murmur of, “Mastermind?” seems to start up, but Kokichi’s voice quickly cuts over the group. “The door to Miu’s lab isn’t soundproof,” he says, all previous playfulness vanishing from his voice. “That’s why I knew.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu immediately shouts, “So you were fucking listening in on us, you little pervert!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She keeps yelling, but Kaede just stares at him, attempting to piece through all the words she knows he’s not saying. Piece together why he all but outright told her to shut up.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">More accusations fly at Kokichi, and Kaede puts together the information only she and Kokichi know. Himiko used one of Miu’s EMPs to cause the blackout. She was killed using the cables in the mastermind’s secret room. And everything that happened was part of some plan she had with Kokichi. The whys of the situation remain elusive, but over the rising din, Kaede says, “Himiko’s death isn’t related to Gonta’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is the first to respond, asking, “What?” far too helplessly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “I know I’m being secretive, but I have reason to believe that Gonta’s killer and Himiko’s are not the same person. Which means…” she turns to address everyone. “Even if we discover who killed Himiko, we can’t do anything about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaito says, “didn’t we just all say we were gonna find justice for her? That we weren’t going to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you think this is about justice or friendship,” Kokichi says, “then you will never learn the truth behind this case. But then again,” he beams at him, “I didn’t expect you to in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s hands tighten into fists. “The hell is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Calm down,” Kaede says. “I don’t know why Kokichi’s saying some of the things he is, but he’s right that there are some serious problems in trying to figure out the culprit behind Himiko’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like the fact that none of you sluts should have been able to do it?” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede chooses to ignore her comment, continuing forward, “Himiko was responsible for the blackout, and to cause the blackout, she went to a secret place that only me, Miu and apparently Kokichi should have known about. However, we all have alibis,” she suddenly realizes something all at once, “Kokichi set it up to make sure it would be impossible for any of us to go after her. Isn’t that why you handcuffed yourself to me and trapped Miu upstairs last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rocks back and forth on his heels. “Maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “All that fucking means is that is had to be someone else, right? Isn’t narrowing down suspects a good thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “The problem is that with the exception of me and Kokichi, everyone else was alone at some point during the blackout, and there’s no time of death on the Monokuma File.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means she could have been killed at any point after the power went off,” Maki says. “Strangling someone as weak and frail as Himiko probably wouldn’t take a lot of time, and it wouldn’t require the killer to clean up any blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie adds, “Ooh, but wasn’t Himiko’s body in the cafeteria? Doesn’t that mean the killer carried her there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does,” Kaede says. “But did anyone see anyone carrying her there?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Moving Himiko’s body…” Tenko says. “It probably wouldn’t have taken the killer much time…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, um,” Tsumugi says. “What does all this mean? Himiko’s killer is still one of us, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They are,” Kaede says firmly. “And that person is the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “Didn’t you say that before? With Rantaro’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought we agreed Monokuma killed Rantaro or something,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says, “<i>we</i> didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede’s right,” Kokichi adds. “Himiko’s death is impossible to figure out, so let’s go back to talking about Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” Tenko shouts. “Y-Himiko’s death is not impossible! There is a solution that we can find here, right?” She looks to Kaede with pleading eyes. “Right? Himiko’s killer—there’s absolutely no way we can just ignore them, a-and,” she moves to wipe away the tears forming in her eyes, “a-and just let them keep hiding and living with all of us… if we don’t find them here, that’s… that’s what’s going to happen…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “There’s no way in hell we’re going to allow that. Especially if they are the mastermind, that means we can end this whole fucking thing right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then God says we can all go home!” Angie says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If we find out who killed Himiko…” Ryoma says. “We can all leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “That’s not how the rules work. Himiko died second, and Monokuma’s already made it abundantly clear that even if we do figure out who killed her, they won’t be executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But that means,” Tsumugi stutters, “that we just have to live with a murderer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Carefully, Kiibo says, “Pardon me if this theory is off base, but is there a chance the culprit explicitly took action after Gonta’s death so that rule would protect them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a sigh. “If Himiko’s killer really is the mastermind, then they would have known what happened to Gonta, and that they could kill anyone who got in their way without consequences…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And starting the blackout,” Angie says. “If Kaede’s right and Himiko did that, God thinks the mastermind probably didn’t like that very much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Wait,” Miu stutters, suddenly shaking, “th-the rip-your-tits-off-and-eat-them-mastermind—that mastermind—st-strangled someone cause they fucked with their shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what we’ve been saying, yes,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s eyes are wide with panic, and her words come fast and frantic, “s-so if you know about that p-place or fucking made something, o-or—!” she directs her gaze to Monokuma, “I swear to fucking God it was all Bakamatsu!” she shouts, “I-I didn’t fucking do anything! S-So d-don’t—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kiibo says, “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Am I alright!?” she screeches. “The mastermind’s gonna—gonna fucking kill me in my sleep!” She begins clawing at her head, chanting, “I have to get out of here, I have to get out of here,” under her breath. “This place is <i>hell! I-I am not going to fucking die here!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t be silly, Miu,” Kokichi says. “The mastermind can only get away with killing you if someone else dies first!” He puffs out his cheeks. “Also the mastermind killing someone is so rude—totally ruins the game. Soooo,” he folds his hands behind his head, “let’s go back to talking about Gonta’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How the fuck can you say that!?” Kaito shouts. “We just figured out who killed Himiko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We didn’t,” Kokichi says. “But if Kaito found any clues while he was investigating, I’d be happy to hear!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns away from him, mumbling darkly, “you know I didn’t fucking investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Kokichi says. “The only people who investigated were me and Kaede, and I say we move on to Gonta’s death.” He turns to Kaede, “and Kaede says…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows he’s testing her, and Kaito and Tenko’s stares weigh heavily on her when she finally says, “We shouldn’t ignore what happened to Himiko, but for the time being—in order to get through this trial—we need to find out who killed Gonta. If we don’t, we’ll all die here, and then we’ll never discover Himiko’s true killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the exception of Miu still mumbling to herself, a heavy silence hangs over the room. The inspiration that Tenko’s words moments earlier had inspired completely vanishes in the face of the reality of their situation, and Kaede realizes again that she has to be the one moving them forward. She straightens her hat, and says, “There are still a few big mysteries surrounding Gonta’s death. If we want to find his killer, we need to start with those.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not a surprise that Ryoma is the first one to respond. “Why he was under the floor,” he says. “Still don’t know the answer to that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why did Himiko agree to help Kokichi in creating the crime scene, too,” Tenko adds, shaking her head. “Himiko was so worried about helping everyone… Tenko can’t believe she would decide to trick us for no reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Though he has proved to enjoy being uncooperative for the sake of it,” Kiibo says, “we still also do not know the true nature behind Kokichi’s plan and how it relates to Gonta’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Tsumugi says, “I don’t think we ever agreed on what the murder weapon in Gonta’s case was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “All of that sounds right, and I think we should start with how Gonta and possibly the culprit got under the floor.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito crosses his arms. “So we’re just fucking moving on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “We have no other choice…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “I believe I was the first to discover some of the floorboards were loose this morning. During the investigation, it was remarkably easy to simply move them out of place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The floorboards in Miu’s room were also loose,” Kokichi says. “That’s how the cockroach was able to scuttle under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu mutters, “Shut up—shut up!” still pulling at her hair.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems slightly taken aback but says, “Erm, the opening in the floorboards under the middle was rather large. Even someone like Gonta probably could have gone through easily enough to get underneath the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi and Kaede spent a lot of time down there,” Ryoma says. “Think they were able to access each room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, does that mean every room had the floor cut up in the same way?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “I got all dirty crawling around under there, especially when we had to follow the blood trail…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Blood trail?” Kaito repeats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi taps a finger to his chin. “Did I forget to mention that when I did all the work for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki snaps, “Stop letting him get to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was a large amount of blood under the floor,” Kiibo confirms, “However, it was slightly off center from where the floorboards could be easily removed, though if Gonta was moved, I suppose there is a logical explanation for that as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, that’s wrong,” Kaede says. “During the investigation, it is true that each of the three rooms had some of their floorboards cut up, but while the middle room and ritual room seemed to have the same consistency in the way the floor was sawed open, the last room was different.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the killer did something different to get under the floor in the last room,” Kiibo says. “Is that correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I think so. When we were investigating, Kokichi and I found two different saws—one that was a normal handsaw hidden in the ritual room and the other was the large circular saw Himiko was supposed to use for one of her magic tricks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But why would the killer do that?” Tsumugi asks. “Was there a reason why they needed to use two different saws?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would like to know that as well,” Kiibo says. “Also, I would like to know the culprit’s purpose in going under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede said Himiko lost her keys,” Ryoma adds. “Maybe the killer had those so they could get into some of the rooms, but needed a way to move to the ones they didn’t have a key to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. Though he’s working off her lie, something about Ryoma’s words click in her brain. “One of the issues we had in the beginning was how this case was a locked room, but Ryoma’s right. The killer only needed to be able to get into one of the rooms and then saw up the floor to move to freely to the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says, “Why did the killer need to go to each room? All that was in the final room was stuff for Himiko’s magic show…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that was also the only room that was different,” Kaede says. “So maybe… the killer <i>didn’t</i> go there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So someone else sawed through the floor?” Angie asks. “Hmm… Angie doesn’t know why anyone would do that.” She clasps her hands together over her head. “Angie will try asking God to see if he knows.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think we have to do that,” Kaede says. “After all, last night, Himiko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko dropped one of her keys…” Tenko says. “The cracks in the floor were not very wide, but Tenko remembers that the key was still small enough to slip through. It… was very important to Himiko that she retrieve it herself… so important that Tenko let her stay there while she went to bed.” Tenko shakes her head. “If only Tenko had helped her, then maybe Himiko—maybe she…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says gently, “You couldn’t have known, and you can’t blame yourself for not being able to predict the future. But,” she straightens her hat, “I think it’s safe to say that Himiko was the one cut up the floor in that room, especially since when I examined the setup for her magic trick, there were no signs of force in removing the saw blade, indicating whoever took it apart knew what they were doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Maki says, “isn’t that a contradiction?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “To what?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said Himiko lost her keys,” she continues. “If she retrieved it from under the floor, then she would have had it this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe Himiko lost it again?” Angie asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “Tenko just said it important to her to get her keys back when she lost them. Why would she carelessly lose them again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There were two rooms Himiko had keys to on the fourth floor,” Kaede says quickly. “She just lost her key to one of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that key was less important than the other?” Maki persists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe she was in a panic this morning?” Tsumugi suggests. “Especially if she was on her way to start the blackout…” she shakes her head. “How did Himiko start the blackout?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stutters, “Uh, that’s not important. None of this is. All that matters is that Himiko and the killer both independently used different saws to get under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “That isn’t an answer to my question, and it’s suspicious that you’re refusing to answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself faltering when Kokichi comes to her rescue. “I know! I know!” he shouts, waving an arm in the air. “Himiko lied about losing her keys, right Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “She did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “Geeze, Kaede, do you really not remember? What did we find in Himiko’s room besides her clothes? It was shiny and gold and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s right,” Kaede says. “Folded up in her bloody clothes, there was… one of her keys and another key covered in gold glitter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, why the fuck would Himiko or anyone else have something like that?” Kaito asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi ignores him. “The pretty shiny key was also kinda bloody, but then again, it was wrapped in bloody clothing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Where does any of this get us? Himiko went under the floor, got her key, and then she decided to help disguise a crime scene because Kokichi talked her into it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “I am awfully convincing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Kiibo says. “Did Himiko manage to do all of that without the killer noticing? Did she do it before or after Gonta was killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We left Himiko around when nighttime announcement played,” Kaede says. “So that was ten, and the Gonta’s death was at midnight, though he likely arrived there a little before that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Himiko was there the whole time?” says Angie. “What about Kokichi? Was he with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “If Kokichi was there, the killer probably would have noticed them. Kokichi’s fucking loud.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am not!” Kokichi whines. “Kaito’s picking on me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know about Kokichi,” Kaede says, “and this is mostly just a theory, but…” she reaches up to fiddle with brim of her hat, “but I think Himiko may have been there when the murder occurred.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Tenko does not think that’s possible because if Himiko witnessed the murder firsthand, then she would have known who the killer is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s harsh voice cuts through the room, “and wouldn’t that mean Kokichi knows, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles widely. “It sure is a possibility, huh? But,” he starts rubbing at his teary eyes, “even if I told you guys, none of you would believe me… you’d probably just vote for me even though I left so many hints…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you do know,” Ryoma says, voice deathly quiet. “Then spit it out already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, not to defend Kokichi,” Tsumugi says, “but isn’t the idea that Himiko saw the murder take place just an assumption? I-I mean it might be true, but I don’t think there’s any evidence…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yeah, Tsumugi,” says Angie. “That’s true. That’s true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “We also still have yet to answer the mystery of why Gonta was under the floor in the first place. For Kaede’s theory to work, would that mean both Gonta and Himiko were under the floor at the same time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the killer didn’t notice her?” Kaito says. “But didn’t they saw up the floor as an escape route? I mean, Himiko’s pretty fucking small, but I think the killer would probably see her if she was lurking under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her shoulders. “I think that might trace back to what Himiko was doing under the floor at the time Gonta was killed. It’s something Kokichi and I accidentally discovered, too.” She sets her hat forward on her head. “And I think it might also be the answer to why Himiko did what she did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This case started,” Kiibo says, “with the killer threatening Gonta into coming up to the fourth floor and then tricking him into going under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What was the killer’s trick?” Tsumugi asks. “Did they maybe pretend to drop something through the floorboards like Himiko did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What was Himiko doing all that time?” Tenko asks quietly. “She-She got her key and then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She obviously had to go back up,” Kaito says. “Otherwise the killer would have fucking noticed her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is dark down there,” Kiibo says. “If Himiko was simply crawling around in the dark, it is doubtful that she would have seen anything, and if she had a light, the killer likely would have seen it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe she took a nap like Miu!” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe you should shut the fuck up!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Angie asks. “But if Himiko took a nap under the floor, she would have missed everything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just like Miu!” Kokichi cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, Kiibo,” Kaede says. “That’s not true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “Did I make a mistake?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yes, during the investigation, Kokichi and I actually figured out that if you’re moving underneath the floor and you use a light source like your monopad aimed at the ground, it’s actually pretty easy to go unnoticed by anyone above you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah!” says Angie. “Angie remembers that! But,” she places a finger on her chin. “Is that what Himiko did?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I remember that, too,” Ryoma says. “You guys were loud because Kokichi kept whining, but I didn’t notice any light, and…” he sighs, “I was looking at the ground near where Kiibo pulled the floorboards up for most of the investigation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right…” Kaede says. “And not only that, but I think what Tsumugi said was also true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” she asks. “Me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The key covered in gold glitter that Kokichi and I found in Himiko’s room,” Kaede says. “We, um, tested it after finding it, and it turns out it was the key to the ritual room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie’s key?” Angie asks. “Is that where it went? But why did Himiko take it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why the fuck would someone even cover a key in glitter in the first place?” Kaito asks. “They want it to be special or stand out or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I think that’s exactly it. Something else I discovered during the investigation is that the glitter on the key still really stands out with even just a little bit of light. Not to mention, going to the trouble of covering something gold glitter was likely a very deliberate choice on the killer’s part, especially since the glitter sticks to stuff really easily.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re saying the killer went to the trouble of preparing a special key to stand out in the dark,” Maki says. “And they did that because?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, um,” Tsumugi says. “You said you think I got it right, when I plainly said that—I think it was—the killer tricked Gonta by pretending to accidentally drop something under the floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if that happened,” Kiibo says, “and Himiko happened to be under the floor to retrieve her own key at the same time—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—or waking up from a nap after getting her key because of all the noise,” Kokichi adds. “Gonta’s really heavy so he has really loud footsteps, like—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins making sound effects akin to Godzilla crashing through a city. Kiibo chooses to ignore him. “Ah, so if Himiko was under the floor while the culprit was attempting to lure Gonta by dropping the shining key, she logically would have seen it as well, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And, what?” Kaito asks, rubbing the back of his head. “They both go after it at the same fucking time or something? I mean, Gonta was into being a gentleman and shit, so I get why he would do it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “He came into the room being threatened—a room full of swords. There’s no way he would just do what the killer said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he felt like he had to,” Tenko says. “Because of the killer’s note… If it was Tenko and Himiko was being threatened, she would have done it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “He wouldn’t do that. Gonta… he always said he was an idiot, but he wasn’t. And,” Ryoma lets out a sigh, looking at the ground, “I refuse to believe he’d just let himself be killed like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What if,” Kaede says, “what if he did it to protect Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s actually some evidence for this, too, but,” Kaede begins, voice soft, “Gonta had really good vision, right? He and you would look for bugs outside that no one else could see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls his hat lower but remains silent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps going. “So maybe—even if the killer didn’t—Gonta saw Himiko moving underneath the floor towards the key, which… was probably also the killer’s mark about where to stab in the dark.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a nice theory,” Maki says. “But if you’re just saying all that to make Ryoma feel better, you aren’t accomplishing much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “A lot of it is just me guessing, but there is something that has been bothering me that I think proves Gonta and Himiko were in almost the exact same place when Gonta was killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stutters, “Th-The same place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “Angie doesn’t even know if that’s possible!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Kaede,” Kokichi says. “Best not to keep your audience in suspense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs. “Kiibo mentioned it before that there was a large pool of blood slightly out of the way from the opening. That’s why we’ve been assuming Gonta was killed under the floor, especially since there was no blood dripping from above. But what was strange about the puddle is that it was uneven—like something had been placed under him to catch some of his blood, and during the entire investigation, there was only one thing I could think of that fit that description.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko breathes out, “Himiko’s clothes…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I understand now,” Kiibo says, crossing his arms. “Though we already cleared up why Kokichi was not covered in blood, it was still odd to me that they did not take the same precautions for Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa, whoa, wait just a fucking second,” says Kaito. “You’re saying literally all of this shit went down right under the killer’s nose, and they didn’t notice any of it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“According to Kokichi’s testimony,” Maki says. “He and Himiko were the ones to move the body. If all of that isn’t a complete lie, then I suppose we can assume the killer never had any intentions of retrieving the corpse from under the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta…” Tenko says. “Gonta died protecting Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma remains silent, staring hard at the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, guess that’s my cue,” Kokichi says brightly. “Kaede mentioned it before, but there was a trail of blood leading away from where Gonta died back up to Himiko’s room, and it was created by Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She was probably terrified,” Tenko says, squeezing her eyes shut. “Himiko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the killer just left after that?” Tsumugi asks. “And Himiko ran into Kokichi later when she was covered in blood?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” Kaede says. “Like Tenko said, Himiko was probably in a panic, and Kokichi… he tried to convince her to help him with a plan to fight against the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rounds on Kokichi standing next to her. “You manipulated Himiko!? You—it’s your fault she’s dead!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond, and Miu keeps shaking her head. “It’s fucked. Everything’s fucked… I’m going to fucking die here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kokichi’s not the killer,” Ryoma says closing his eyes. “But in Himiko’s case, he may as well have been…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unfortunately,” Maki says. “We can’t vote for him. Being responsible for someone’s death is not the same as directly killing them, but even if it was, this is a trial for Gonta’s murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Are there any clues we haven’t gone over yet? Some of our theories are still pretty fucking shaky, honestly, but even if we believe in them, do we even fucking have anything left to point us to the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is,” Kaede says. “We never confirmed the murder weapon or where the killer stashed it after the murder. I… only have indirect clues, but I think there’s only one person who could have hid the murder weapon where I think they did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s an awful lot of ‘I thinks,’” Maki says. “And an awful lot of relying on your word.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Well, as Kokichi keeps point out, my word is all we have, but,” she straightens her hat, “It should still be enough to end this case.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A day late, but here it is! This fic is quite a bit of work to write, and I usually have fun writing most chapters, however, this chapter was not one of them, haha. I've had the major twists for this chapter planned out almost since the beginning (and shout out to a few commenters who figured me out completely, haha) but actually writing out the reveals for them was a bit trickier than I anticipated. Hopefully there aren't too many jumps/holes in the logic used!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Angie, you said this morning that Himiko came to see you, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Mhmm, mhmm! She was super nervous so Angie gave her some encouragement!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And… you said she hugged you, right?” Kaede continues.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Angie answered. “Himiko doesn’t really do stuff like that so that’s why Angie knew she was really nervous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Kaede says taking another breath as she straightens her shoulders. “And no one else besides me and Tenko saw Himiko or Kokichi before the blackout, right?” A silence greets her, and Kaede takes another moment before she says, “That’s what I thought.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head. “Huh? Kaede, is there something wrong with Angie seeing Himiko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s just that, well,” Kaede says, “a problem I’ve had with this whole conversation is that there is almost no doubt that Himiko knew who the killer was, and that before her death, she made sure to give Tenko the key to your lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie gasps. “Himiko stole Angie’s key?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” asks Kaito. “Did she do it when she fucking hugged her or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko,” Tenko says tightly. “She did slip the key into Tenko’s pocket when she hugged her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Pickpocketing is a pretty easy skill to teach someone who’s already good at sleight of hand,” Kokichi says rocking back and forth on his heels. “Or reverse pickpocketing in Tenko’s case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” says Maki. “So Angie was specifically targeted by Himiko—and apparently Kokichi, as well—that morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, so, so,” says Angie. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko and Kaede did search through Angie’s lab during the investigation,” Tenko says sending Kaede a wary look, “though we did not find anything of interest other than the tools that Angie used to finish the wax statues, and those were to be expected.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it didn’t fucking matter,” Miu mumbles. “None of this shit fucking matters—nothing we do matters…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it was important to Himiko that Tenko receive that key,” Tenko says, new confidence surging through her words. “And if it was important to Himiko then Tenko refuses to believe it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo adds, “I also think it is logical that the key would be important if it was something Himiko did right before her death. However,” he frowns, bringing his hand to his chin, “though I am aware that Kokichi… enjoys playing games, I still do not know why Himiko would fail to tell someone she trusted as much as Tenko who the killer is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Kokichi probably told her to. If she was willing to go along with half his idiotic not-plan, she probably would keep her mouth shut if she was told to as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think it’s more complicated than that. After all, we still haven’t established a concrete reason for why Himiko would agree to do what she did in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “If… if what you said about Gonta… deciding to protect her was true, then she was probably scared.” He pulls his hat down. “Don’t know how that translates to working with Kokichi, though…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Well, people do crazy shit when they’re scared, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like scream about ghosts like a big scaredy cry baby?” Kokichi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at him. “You shut the fuck up—especially since you know what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Kokichi knows what happened,” Tsumugi says. “Shouldn’t he talk more?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kokichi. “Don’t you want to hear my melodic voice give you all the answers, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares again as Kaede opts to speak over whatever bickering she knows is coming. “<i>Anyway</i> I think the answer to why Himiko decided to work together with Kokichi to try and stop the killing game is relatively simple.” She takes a deep breath. “The killer was probably someone she liked—someone she would want to protect, even if she was traumatized.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I see. And if she had succeeded in ending the game with Kokichi, then the killer would be freed along with everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we’d all be out of this fucking death trap,” Miu curses under her breath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s hands tighten into fists. “You’re saying Gonta died to save her, and Himiko still decided to protect the killer? We’ve been going in circles all this time because—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s only a theory,” Kaede quickly amends. “But… it fits together with everything else too well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “I think we’re reaching the end. I left a super special hint for the last mystery, and once that’s solved there should be no doubt.” He grins, folding his hands behind his head. “Go ahead and tell them who it is, Kaede. I wouldn’t want to steal your thunder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives him a long before she sighs and turns back to the group. “The killer… didn’t want this trial. I think they did what they did because they wanted to keep everyone safe, not to escape. This was a while ago, so they may have forgotten they even said it, but they once mentioned committing a murder where no one would find the body so there couldn’t be a trial, and I think that’s what would have happened if it hadn’t been for Himiko and Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks out over everyone again and tells herself this is the best path. Kokichi will do it if she doesn’t. She can make this… as painless as possible. Kaede takes another breath and says, “You’re the killer, aren’t you, Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie just blinks at her. “Huh? Angie’s not the killer. God told Angie to protect everyone in the student council so we could all live here peacefully—she would never do a thing like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her resistance makes Kaede wince. “I don’t doubt that’s true, but if you felt like someone was a threat to that peace…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Angie tilts her head. “Kaede, Angie knows you already betrayed her earlier, but she wasn’t expecting this!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito. “So wait—of everyone here, Angie fucking felt <i>Gonta</i> was a threat to her student council?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at the ground. “He was one of the few people to outright reject her offer to join…” he lets out a sigh. “Because I fucking told him to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s still shaking. “That’s all if f-f-fucking takes? That’s all it takes to be fucking killed!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone wait!” Angie says. “Angie’s not the killer—too bad, Kaede! Soooo,” she tilts her head, “who’s your next guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gapes at her for a moment. “I—what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie just smiles. “Soooo, Angie’s super not the killer. She just said that already!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not an argument,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Angie taps a finger to her chin. “Why does Angie need to argue when she’s innocent? God thinks that’s silly.” Her smile doesn’t falter even a fraction but something in it darkens as she leans forward. “You’re saying Angie’s the killer because they targeted Gonta, right? But Angie didn’t send the threatening note.” She clasps her hands. “Therefore Angie’s not the killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” says Tsumugi. “Is that an argument?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who cares about the fucking note?” Kaito says. “You had motive and shit—isn’t that enough?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, picking at his fingernails. “Jumping on the bandwagon once Kaede picks a suspect without thinking, well,” he beams at him, “anything really. But that’s just the Kaito way!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito balks at him, opening and closing his mouth a few times before shouting, “What the fuck is your problem with me!? Is Angie not the killer!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, she is,” Kokichi answers. “She’s the killer but nothing else. Even someone as useless as you should be able to figure that out from everything we’ve talked about, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito keeps yelling almost blindly in the face of being insulted, but Kaede furrows her brow, turning his words over in her mind. “Angie… didn’t setup the crime scene or kill Himiko or cause the blackout. Did… did she really not send the letter, either?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you rambling about?” Maki asks. “Saying she didn’t send the letter is obviously a flimsy lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Angie didn’t!” she cheers. “And God says the person who sent the letter has to be the killer. So, Kaede,” Angie turns to her. “Who else do you think the killer is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her. “Angie—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop listening to her, Kaede,” Maki says. “Obviously she’s trying to get you to defend her like you did for Shuichi and Korekiyo.” She sighs. “Really, if we want this to get any further someone else should take the lead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But no one can,” Kokichi says brightly. “Unless you have evidence, Harumaki-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s entire body seizes up and her face darkens dangerously as she turns her glare on him. “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stutters, “H-Hey, Maki, calm down—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw!” Kokichi clasps his hands. “My beloved Kaito is coming to my rescue!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’m not doing shit!” Kaito quickly calls out. “I’m just—I don’t—” he looks lost for a moment, and Kaede notices one of his hand moving to grab at his side before he yells, “both of you fucking knock it off! We’re not,” he clenches his jaw, “we’re not fucking getting anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says stiffly, staring the three of them down. “We’re not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So doubting Angie was a dead end, then,” Angie says before steepling her hands. “Angie asked God, and he said to remain calm even in these trying times, and now Angie has been proven innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what happened,” Ryoma snaps. “Stop twisting our words to suit whatever you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” she says. “But that’s what you’ve all been doing to Angie.” She ticks off her fingers. “Angie didn’t set up the crime scene or hurt Himiko or even have her keys to her lab, so,” she smiles, “the only thing Angie is guilty of is being friends with Himiko—and God says that isn’t a reason to suspect her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I have to agree. Kaede,” he turns to her, “you said earlier that suspecting Angie fit together with other pieces of evidence, presumably. However, I’m afraid it is still unclear what those are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Tsumugi chimes in. “If you don’t mind me asking, you said you explored Angie’s lab earlier and didn’t find anything. So wouldn’t that mean she’s innocent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie claps her hands. “Oh, that’s totally right, Tsumugi! Angie has nothing to hide!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at her and can’t help but lower Shuichi’s hat slightly over her eyes. “That’s not true, Angie,” she says. “The key to Gonta’s case is where the killer hid the murder weapon, and if I’m right, you’re the only person who could have done it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “I’m not arguing with you, Kaede, but we still don’t even know what the murder weapon was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “We know exactly what it was because there’s one thing that <i>has</i> to have been at the crime scene that we couldn’t find anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, you say ‘we,’” Kokichi says. “But it’s really just you and me, Kaede. Oh,” he places a finger to his lips, “and the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then tell us,” Tenko says. “You keep saying we’re close to the end, but you also keep refusing to answer Tenko’s questions!” She shakes her head. “Tenko is sick of this trial and sick of doubting her friends, but you won’t let us just stop. You know all the answers, but you’re forcing us all to go through this… We… we won’t be able to do anything for Himiko, but we’re still here insulting each other over and over again over Gonta.” She looks up, and Kaede recognizes the pure exhaustion she had seen earlier coming in full force as Tenko wipes at the tears running down her face. “Why won’t you let us just stop already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words jolt Miu to life, and she shrieks, “He’s fucking getting off on our suffering! Th-That’s it! I’m right, aren’t I!? D-Don’t even try to fucking lie, you midget sadist freak!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma snaps, “Didn’t you hear a word Tenko just said?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu returns to quivering, letting out a high pitched squeak as she does so. Kiibo tentatively reaches out a hand to rest on her shoulder. She whips her head towards him as he says, “Miu, please calm down. I am aware our situation is not good, and Angie is someone I consider a friend as well. However, if we want to proceed forward to finally finish our discussion, exploring this line of questioning may be necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” says Kaito, seemingly regaining some of his composure, though one hand remains clutching his side. “You’re fucking right. I have no idea what shit Kaede’s talking about, but we should hear her out. ‘Sides,” he lets out a resigned sigh. “If we’re gonna get the answer handed to us, better her than Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles at him. “Aw, looks like Kaito’s finally starting to understand how this works.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls as Kaede grimaces at his words. “Thank you, Kaito,” she says quickly. “I think if we can answer this, we can finally put to rest what the murder weapon was, and,” she sends a look towards Angie still smiling brightly before shifting Shuichi’s hat to obscure her completely. “And from there it should confirm Angie’s guilt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie doesn’t know why we’re even talking about this,” Angie says. “Angie isn’t guilty, so there’s nothing to talk about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whether you are guilty or not, Angie,” Kiibo says diplomatically, “it is best we confirm the murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-It was one of loli’s fucking swords!” Miu shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We have already established that Himiko’s swords are innocent,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the crime scene,” Ryoma says, “nothing that looked like a weapon has blood on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” Kiibo adds. “Even upon inspecting the swords inside the statues, we did not find any blood or other substances.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Other substances?” Tsumugi echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like shit?” Miu adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” Kiibo stutters, “I am simply trying to cover everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck is this conversation?” Kaito mumbles under his breath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says Angie’s statues are innocent,” Angie says. “And so is Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “There was nothing on the statues you inspected with Angie, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “That is correct. Is… there something wrong with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she shakes her head. “Those ones all should have been clean. The only one that wasn’t is the strangest one—the statue of Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can practically hear Maki roll her eyes. “Does your deluded obsession with him really have anything to do with this case? Or are you going to argue it was his ghost again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her fists. “Hey, Maki, I don’t think I remember you ever going to the crime scene.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face darkens. “Stop trying to undermine me. My point still stands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki, stop,” Tenko says. “Kaede has been helping us find the truth this entire time—there is no reason to doubt her reasoning now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Have to agree,” Ryoma sighs. “And she’s right by the way. Shuichi’s statue was the only one that wasn’t impaled with a sword. ‘Course we all know that was Kokichi’s doing now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it’s all bullshit?” Miu says. “A-And this is fuck-all and we have no proof!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No. I mean, I don’t doubt that Kokichi did it,” Kaede says. “But I also don’t think that means we should just dismiss it. Especially since,” she looks over to Kokichi batting his eyelashes at her. She pinches the bridge of her nose. “Especially since this entire trial has been him giving us hints.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “So it’s another hint, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “Mhmm! My beloved Kaito knows me so well!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs again. “Stop fucking talking to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, but, but, but,” Angie says. “If Kokichi did it, then God says that just makes him suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does,” Kaede says. “But that isn’t the only reason. I… would like to think he wouldn’t do something like that just for the sake of amusing himself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A dangerous assumption,” Maki adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, so,” Tsumugi says. “Kokichi left Shuichi’s statue alone for a reason then? Is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If I am following your logic correctly,” Kiibo says. “Then Kokichi purposefully did not tamper with the statue of Shuichi to give us a hint towards the true identity of the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie presses her hands to her cheeks. “Ooh, Angie wonders who it is!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her and has to swallow the dread rising up in her throat before she can trust herself to speak without stuttering. “The point is, Kokichi did it to draw attention to the statue—particularly the fact that it had some of the same gold glitter that the key did on it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” says Kaito. “The fuck would gold glitter be anywhere else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh! Um,” Tsumugi says quickly. “I played this one game where a girl tried to murder someone—but she ended up getting killed herself, though I suppose that’s not really important—and her target at one point used a golden sword to defend themselves, but the glitter was really sticky and got everywhere, and, um…” she cuts herself off, becoming pointedly aware of all the stares suddenly directed towards her rambling. “Does any of that have to do with the case?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just blinks. “Actually yes. I was about to say that the glitter did stick to other things really easily.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito. “Is this glitter shit like the crap on the sword Kokichi tried to wipe on my coat? Took for-fucking-ever to get it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head. “Longer than the bloodstains?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens his mouth to yell before suddenly wincing and clutching at his side again. “Sh-Shut up…” he says. “I told you to fucking shut up…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s normally cold eyes watch the motion with an emotion Kaede can’t quite place before she says, “Let’s end this quickly, then. There was a golden sword—Kaede seems incapable of saying it outright, but that’s probably the murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “That sword was in Korekiyo’s research lab—anyone could have taken it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means there’s no proof, and Angie’s proven innocent once again!” Angie says. “So God says now we should work together to find the real killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not proof of anything,” Ryoma says coldly. “If anyone could have taken it, then you’re still a suspect, and you’re a murderer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Ryoma,” Angie says. “Can Angie ask you a question?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at her skeptically for a moment. “You’re asking me a question?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie is,” she nods. “See, Angie thinks you’re thinking about this wrong. You keep talking about the killer like they just killed Gonta for fun or because they were selfish, but didn’t Gonta choose to be killed? Shouldn’t he be the person you’re angry at?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares openmouthed at her. “Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma grips the edges of his podium. “How dare you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, as far as Angie understands it,” she says. “From the weird note and Kaede’s theory about Himiko, Gonta totally decided to let himself die to protect everyone! So, so, so God thinks that we’re thinking about this wrong! If the victim chooses to let themselves die and the killer tried to avoid having a trial like Kaede said, then why does anyone have a problem?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie,” Tenko says. “Gonta is dead…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Angie feels really sad about that!” she clasps her hands together. “Angie prayed for him during the investigation, and she’ll pray even harder after the trial. God says it’s super sad when someone dies, but it’s okay because they’re with him so they get to be at peace and stuff. So the way Angie sees it, Gonta’s at peace, and we can all still live here peacefully, so there isn’t really a problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll all be executed if we don’t figure out who the killer is,” Maki says plainly. “I think even the most idiotic of us could agree that is a problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie tilts her head to the side. “But there’s a solution to that, too? Last time Kaede said we don’t have to vote, and that means we can just pause the trial and keep living like nothing happened. Yup!” She claps her hands. “God thinks that’s exactly what we should do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Is that even a possibility?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Wait,” Miu stutters. “After we’re done with this bullshit trial, we all just go back to the fucking killing game? Th-That’s what happens if we vote…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we either don’t fucking vote now and all die together or we do and die later?” Kaito asks. “What kind of fucked up argument is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s true!” Angie says. “And God thinks everyone living together and lying and betraying each other is really sad. Because even if we do find the right killer, there’s still a murderer among us, right?” She pauses, tapping a finger to her chin. “Or, another murderer at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki and Ryoma both glare at her. Tenko clears her throat. “Angie, what are you talking about? Are you confessing to being the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head with a bright smile. “Nope! Because Angie didn’t do anything wrong!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “I… am unsure of this direction of conversation, however we still have yet to provide conclusive evidence that Angie or anyone else is the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm!” Angie says. “That’s right, Kiibo! Is that what God is telling you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses. “My inner voice says… we should continue to pursue all the mysteries behind this case, and we will not be satisfied until we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Satisfied?’” Ryoma spits out. “Is that what we’ll be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… what?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Two people are dead, and we’re about to sentence someone else to death,” Ryoma says. “What kind of sick person would be satisfied with that outcome?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah,” Kiibo says, bowing his head. “I apologize. I merely meant from…” he frowns. “I don’t know. I… I apologize again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiiboy being a useless robot aside,” Kokichi says. “We still should find the final proof to show Angie, especially since I went to all the trouble of setting up a really cool mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Hey, Ryoma, think Kokichi’s the sick kind of person you were talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t respond other than to pulls his hat down and mumble, “tired of this crap…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone,” Kaede says centering herself. “Everyone listen to me—we’re all exhausted and hurting and we want this to just be over already. So,” she straightens Shuichi’s hat, “I’m going to do my best to end things right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki quirks an eyebrow. “After dragging out every trial, this is the one where you put your foot down?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede says. “I’m trying to save my friends. I know you don’t care about anyone here besides yourself, so why don’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to be killed?” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t back down, keeping her glare steady on Maki. “No. Which is why I’m going to find the answer, no matter what you think of me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What we need to discover,” Kaede says. “Is where the killer hid the murder weapon, and who the only person who could have done that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was Kokichi!” Angie says. “He set up the crime scene!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The shitty golden sword was the murder weapon,” Kaito says, “and if you touch that crap it gets fucking everywhere. So if Kokichi hid it, wouldn’t there be gold shit everywhere?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Go, Kaito!” Kokichi cheers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede said there was gold on Shuichi’s statue,” Tenko says. “Does that mean the killer touched it after handling the sword?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Go, Tenko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we cannot forget the statues were specifically impaled with swords by Kokichi to give us a hint,” Kiibo says. “Meaning a sword being inside a statue is a clue somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, Kiiboy,” Kokichi pouts. “You’re ruining everything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am simply trying to help aid the discussion!” Kiibo shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s it,” Kaede says. “That’s exactly what it is—the gold covered sword that was used to kill Gonta was hidden inside Shuichi’s statue.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-Inside the sex doll?” Miu says. “But we fucking moved those ourselves, and nothing slipped out!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The sword was put in later,” Kaede says. “While we were investigating, Kokichi and I found more gold glitter in the ritual room. It’s likely the killer set it up later so none of us would have noticed even if we had inspected the statues then. Actually,” she takes a deep breath, “with the time Angie spent preparing yesterday without the instruction book… it would make sense if she was doing something else besides preparing the room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… Tenko understands now,” she says. “Angie also could easily have gone back and forth between the ritual room and her lab without any of us questioning it even we saw her. Also… Tenko had been so impressed by Angie’s statues—she’s the only person who even has the ability to do such a thing like specially design a statue to hide a weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “It’s also starting to sound like she was the only one with opportunity, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” says Kaito. “So Kokichi’s stupid hint was that Shuichi’s statue didn’t have a sword in it because it <i>already</i> had a fucking sword in it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi beams. “I thought it was pretty clever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How in the fuck were we supposed to figure that out!?” Kaito yells. “I’m getting really fucking sick o-of—” he suddenly cuts himself off, and Kaede sees one of his hands dart to clutch at his side while the other reaches forward to steady himself on the podium. “—of your… your bullshit…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares hard at him with barely concealed concern. “We should end this soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Hmm, hey, Monokuma, is there a place Kaito can sit down at during trials?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sh-Shut up,” Kaito says. “I’m fine. We need to keep talking about… whatever the fuck it was we were talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo hesitates for a moment before pressing forward. “I believe at present we have solved the mystery of the murder weapon for Gonta’s case. And…” he frowns. “I believe that is everything. Or at least, everything we are capable of answering now, if I am not mistaken.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then…” Tenko looks at the ground. “Is discovering what happened to Himiko really impossible? If this is the end, then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tenko!” Angie says. “Angie wants to figure out who killed Himiko, too. Especially since we never could figure out why she did so many of the things she did before her death. And without those, Angie doesn’t think we’ll ever be able to find the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede regards her warily. “Angie… what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” she tilts her head. “Angie’s just saying that there is still one big mystery we don’t know the answer to, and!” she clasps her hands together. “It’s a mystery that proves Angie is innocent, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you just give it up already,” Ryoma sighs. “You have no defenses left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but, like, that’s not true at all, Ryoma,” Angie says. “See, Angie remembers Kaede and Tenko talking about how Himiko gave Tenko the key to Angie’s lab because it was super important, but they couldn’t find anything in there. And if Angie was the killer, why would she do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does it fucking matter!?” Miu yells. “Sh-She did it ‘cause she was gonna get fucked by the mastermind!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi asks. “Is that why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko did it to prove Angie’s innocence,” Angie says. “That’s what God says. And also,” her smile doesn’t falter even as her face turns dark. “Angie thinks she understands what’s going on here. Kaede’s decided to protect the killer again, so she’s accusing Angie to save them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her in shock as Tenko gasps, “Angie!? What are you saying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie just thinks this all really convenient,” Angie says. “Kaede was super sad about not being the leader anymore and even sadder when we decided that Kokichi was the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So your argument is that Kokichi’s the killer, and Kaede’s accusing you out of spite?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t move from his hunched over position but shakes his head. “No. Kaede wouldn’t do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if it’s not true,” Angie says, “then why did Himiko give Tenko the key to Angie’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a breath. Korekiyo had accepted his fate without a fight. Shuichi had done all the work for her in condemning himself. Angie continues to talk, clinging to any hope of life left possible to her, and Kaede can find no fault in that. However, to move forward, Kaede knows she has to finally take on the burden she had been avoiding for so long.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie stares her down, her smile unwavering even as her words flow in a dizzying hurry, and Kaede prepares to go to battle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(THEORY ARMAMENT)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is absolutely no way Angie is the killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“Angie only wanted to help everyone."</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“God told her to protect all of her student council members.”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“And Himiko’s such a good friend, she decided to protect Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko gave Tenko the key to Angie’s lab."</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“In order to prove Angie's innocence because she knew she would be suspected."</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">"Himiko probably asked God and told her to."</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">"And we can thank them both for the proof that Angie is innocent!"</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">"The fact that there was nothing suspicious in Angie's lab is why Himiko gave Tenko the key."</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">"It was the last thing Himiko was able to do before she died, so it has to be important!"</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>"And there is no other reason possible for why Himiko would give Tenko the key!"</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s wrong,” Kaede says. “There has to be another reason why Himiko gave Tenko the key, and it wasn’t to protect Angie, it was to keep her out of her lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie taps a finger to her chin. “Keep out? That’s silly, Kaede! Why would—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because then you’d be able to cover your tracks,” Kaede says. “If you could go back to your lab that morning, you could have hidden evidence almost completely from us. The only reason why Himiko was even safe waiting until morning to try and steal it was because she had Kokichi with her who could pick the locks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, God says—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you had access to your lab during or before the investigation this morning,” Kaede says. “You could have easily moved all the statues there with the excuse of needing to fix them, and then no one would have been able to investigate them. If you had access to your lab, you could have completely prevented us from discovering the murder weapon or where it was hidden, and Himiko wanted to stop that from happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie grips the edges of her podium, her smiling face dangerously dark. “But you said Himiko wanted to protect Angie. If she wanted to protect Angie, then why would she—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said Himiko wanted to protect the killer,” Kaede says. “Because she wanted to stop the trial altogether. But… there were probably other people here Himiko also wanted to protect, and that is the true reason for why she did everything she did!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie’s grip tightens, and Kaede can hear the minute sounds of her nails raking across the metal. “But God says that’s just a theory, so Angie doesn’t think—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s true,” Kokichi says, dully examining his fingernails. “Himiko wanted to help save everyone, but it really wasn’t much of a contest when it came to save everyone or save just Angie. Also,” he grins. “It was my plan, too, and I wasn’t about to let someone win the game just yet. That’d be boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie shakes her head. Even with nothing left, she continues to fight. “But Angie was framed. Kaede proved it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just because you were,” Maki says. “Doesn’t mean you didn’t do it. We’ve already proved Kokichi’s ridiculous frame job was just for his own amusement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There wasn’t supposed to be a trial!” Angie says. “Angie didn’t want a trial, and she didn’t want to hurt Gonta, and she didn’t write that note!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her words. “‘That note?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think we can consider that a confession,” Ryoma says lowly. “Let’s just end this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” Kaede shouts quickly. “Angie, there’s something important I need to ask you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “If you’re about to defend her after proving her guilty yourself—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not that,” Kaede says, still focused on Angie. “Angie, can you tell me where Gonta was last night before he came to the fourth floor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie looks confused, simply shrugging at her question. “Angie doesn’t know. She could try asking God if that would prove her innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It wouldn’t,” Ryoma hisses. “Nothing could at this point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kaede has something she needs to ask,” Tenko says. “And if Kaede believes it’s important, then Tenko does, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we already know who the killer is for real this time,” Tsumugi says. “What more is there to prove?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu whines. “Let’s just fucking stop already… I can’t go any longer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito says. “Both of you shut up. Kaede’s done so much for all of us, and you keep fucking doubting her.” He lets out a humorless laugh. “She fucking held my hand through this entire trial, and I don’t think anyone here can say she didn’t do the same for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “Aww, Kaito does listen to me! Maybe there’s hope for our relationship yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes at him. “Kaede, go ahead. You obviously know what the hell you’re doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Thank you. Angie,” she turns to address her. “Why did you target Gonta?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie didn’t!” she insists. “Angie already said she didn’t write the note! That’s why she went to the computer lab during the investigation—God says she could find the true culprit if she figured out who did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scoffs. “What a flimsy lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I’m… starting to get the feeling she’s telling the truth. Angie—one last question—this… is going to end soon, so can you tell me what you took from Gonta’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie blinks at her. “Angie never went to Gonta’s lab at the bug appreciation party. God said she’d end up eating another bug if she did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Something was taken from his lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you didn’t break anything in there either, then?” Kaede persists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie never went there!” she says. “Why do you keep asking? Angie didn’t go to Gonta’s lab, she didn’t write the note, and she didn’t want to hurt Gonta! You can ask God if she’s lying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Or I could ask a serial liar. Kokichi,” she turns to him. “Is she telling the truth?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are we really about to trust a confirmed liar to tell us if someone is lying?” Maki says. “This is ridiculous…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s important,” Kaede insists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To her surprise, Ryoma says, “I want to hear, too. Kokichi—what do you say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares forward at Angie and hums. “Well, I already had my suspicions, but,” he folds his hands behind his head. “She is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie says, “Angie told you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then…” Tenko says. “If it was not Angie, who did write the threatening note?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The true killer!” Angie says. “Angie’s said over and over again that we need to find the person who wrote the note because they’re the one responsible for everything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘The one responsible…’” Kaede echoes. “Could it be the master—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And time’s up!” Monokuma says. “We had a false start on the vote but now wait no longer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips her head to him, “but we haven’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who is the killer of Gonta Gokuhara?” Monokuma says. “Take your best guess and vote, vote, vote!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The screen in front of her lights up, and Kaede stares at it almost helplessly for a second. “This trial…” she says. “There is something seriously wrong with this trial…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we have to vote, right?” Tsumugi asks, wringing her hands. “Even if we couldn’t figure everything out, we still have to vote…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Angie. “Like Kaede said last time, we could always—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop trying to get out of it,” Maki says as she clicks a bottom on her podium.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a frown, Kiibo does the same as he says, “Our objective was to discover who Gonta’s killer was. Being unable to answer our other questions surrounding this case is unfortunate, but it’s all we can do to move forward and hope for a better outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “So there’s nothing to fucking do other than do it, is that right?” He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment as if wincing in pain before saying, “this bullshit is just our new normal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would not say that,” Kiibo says. “Instead I believe that we cannot allow ourselves to be overcome with doubt and despair if we wish to keep moving and escape from here. We cannot only focus on everything we are incapable of. My inner voice says what we must do instead is to continue on with hope that we will soon overcome our situation and any obstacles in our path.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">An awkward silence fills the room as his words linger unanswered in the air.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, Ryoma says, “What are you all waiting for? We’ve been trying to end this for so long, so just vote already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances between him and Kiibo and pulls Shuichi’s hat as far over her face as she can as she picks Angie from the pictures in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s near unanimous with one vote tallied for Kokichi instead of Angie, and Kaede can think of no one besides the girl in question who would do such a thing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They move to the sides of the stands, and Angie’s same smile still stays on her face as she clasps her hands and bows her head. A few of her classmates seem on the verge of saying something, and Kaede quickly says, “if she wants to pray we should let her. There’s… I don’t think there’s anything else Angie can tell us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Another uncomfortable silence falls over them, only to be interrupted by Monokuma popping up to announce, “Three for three! Yup—the blackened who killed Gonta Gokuhara, the Ultimate Entomologist, is Angie Yonaga, the Ultimate Artist!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that’s all she did!” Tenko says, rushing over to the bear. “Monokuma, please, we discovered what happened to Gonta, so please tell us who killed Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without another word, Tenko quickly drops to her knees and bows her head. “Please! Tenko and the others have done everything you asked, and we are about to lose another one of our friends. Please tell us what happened to Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede breathes out, “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma just huffs. “Geeze! Whine, whine, whine! How many times do I have to tell you that that’s not important?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam waddles up to him. “WILL-THAT-INFORMATION-HELP-EVERYONE-GET-ALONG?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma turns to him. “It will not, especially since,” he puts his paws in front of his mouth, “a hidden killer lurking among you just makes the game more fun! The very thought of it is filling me with despair already, and I’m not even playing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“THEN,” Monodam jilts, “IT-WILL-JUST-MAKE-THINGS-HARDER-FOR-THEM. IS-THAT-WHAT-WILL-HAPPEN-IF-YOU-CONTINUE-TO-RUN-THIS-GAME, FATHER?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma laughs. “It’s what I do! Paranoia, suspense, despair! All are right up my ally! I didn’t waste away in college majoring in despair for nothing, after all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Stop, please stop. Tenko doesn’t care about despair o-or,” she lifts her head, and Kaede can see the fresh tears running down her face anew. “Or anything else. T-Tenko just wants to know why Himiko had to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma remains silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please!” she shouts again. “Why won’t you tell us!? This trial has been so long and painful, and we’ve been able to do nothing for her! You want us to figure out y-your mysteries and h-hurt each other, so why won’t you—!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says again, this time kneeling down by her side. “I…” she looks at Monokuma and swallows. “I don’t think there’s anything we can do now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko covers her face with her hands, brushing at her tears, and Kaede gently places her arm around Tenko’s shaking shoulders. Though her voice is muffled by her hands and sobs, Tenko says, “Y-Himiko wanted to stop this horrible g-game, and save us all, a-and we can’t do a-anything for her! Tenko can’t… T-Tenko couldn’t p-protect her, and n-now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head as her words dissolve and only her sobbing is left to fill the room. Angie’s voice is the one to break the silence. “Tenko,” she says softly, “when Angie gets to heaven, she’ll tell Himiko how much you loved her, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over to her. “Angie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She steeples her hands over her head. “Angie just finished talking to God, and she’s ready to go be with him and leave peacefully with the others. Angie’s sad things had to turn out like this—she wanted to stay here with everyone and live together—but she’s also okay with going to God now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop trying to earn sympathy,” Ryoma says. “Maybe you didn’t write the note, but you still killed Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie just hums. “Angie didn’t want to, but she had no other choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Maki snaps. “We’ve already proved that you committed premeditated murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie didn’t want to hurt Gonta,” she says again. “But when he showed up on the fourth floor last night, he started asking Angie lots of weird questions and refused to leave.” She shakes her head. “Angie had no plans to ever harm Gonta, but he came and saw everything Angie had setup—she had no other choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-Then!” Miu jabs a finger at her. “Y-You were fucking going to kill someone else!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a deep breath. “It was me, wasn’t it? You were going to kill me, and…” he shakes his head, “my body would be easier to move than Gonta’s. Your plan to hide the corpse where no one could find it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Angie never wanted to escape. She just wanted to do what God said and protect everyone. Ryoma was someone who refused to listen and always broke or argued with Angie’s rules. And God says a society can’t function if it can’t enforce its rules, and then it loses its credibility and falls apart for everyone who wanted to be a part of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “So this is all my fault…” he closes his eyes and sighs again. “From the very beginning, everything was my fault…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” Tenko says from place on the ground. “What happened to Gonta, a-and,” her voice breaks, “a-and Himiko… i-it was all the mastermind. That’s what K-Kaede said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut and nods. “Everything about this… everything that happened was planned by the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So discovering their identity should be our next goal,” Kiibo says. “That is the only way we can finally put a stop to their despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “Why are you all talking like we don’t know who the mastermind is? It’s obviously Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s head snaps to her. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t be ridiculous,” Maki says. “We’ve already established the mastermind is the person who set up both Himiko and Gonta’s murderers, and that person is Kokichi. He’s been taunting us about it this entire time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grits her teeth. “Kokichi is not the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to hear that from him,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to argue back when Monokuma cuts in. “Alright, alright! Enough jabbering! We’ve got an execution to get to!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie nods. “Hmm, God says Angie has to go now.” She smiles brightly as she clasps her hands together one last time. “Goodbye, everyone! Angie has to go be with God now, but she hopes everyone else can continue to live together peacefully and remember her. Oh! And never forget,” she leans forward and that same shadow creeps over her face, “wanting to leave will only lead to more killings.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any peace that her earlier words had brought vanishes in the face of her sinister warning. Then Monokuma swings his hammer, and Angie skips to her execution.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>GAME OVER</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>ANGIE YONAGA HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>TIME FOR THE PUNISHMENT</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie steeples her hands and keeps her head bowed in prayer even as the set of her execution constructs itself around her. It’s an island—like the on Kaede often imaging her living on with all of her friends and family back home—and the cut outs of waves and palm trees flourish out of the ground, each having the appearance of something a child would doodle with crayons. Then a crudely drawn volcano appears and the drums start beating in the distance.</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>Wax Angel: Burned by the Light</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie keeps her eyes closed and her expression is almost serene as snow seemingly starts to emerge from the volcano above and fall down around her. From their place outside the execution, Kaede blinks and focuses her eyes on the strange off-white substance falling above Angie’s head, outlining her like a halo, and realizes its tiny pieces of wax.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Angie grimaces only slightly when it sticks to her, slowly coating her entire body from the top of her head to the soles of her sandals. Angie doesn’t try to fight or budge an inch, and through what must be the incredible pain of having the hat wax slowly coat her, she manages to find her peaceful smile again and keeps praying to a God she always believed in with all her heart.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows all of Monokuma’s executions are slow and painful, but with her smile and her head bowed and her hands held in prayer and the off-white fog surrounding her, Angie looks almost like an angel.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Monokubs and Monokuma stand off to the side, watching her, and in a strange moment, Monodam rushes forward towards Monokuma, sending him flying into the execution ring.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie continues to stand peacefully even as Monokuma speeds from one end to the other, the wax coating his tiny robotic form in equal measure. Angie doesn’t seem to notice or care, and even from outside, Kaede has little hope that Monokuma’s death will mean the end of anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The wax finally stops when Angie is completely coated, her expression of faith frozen on her face. For what it’s worth, Monokuma remains frozen, too, baring a distinctly more panicked look.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everything seemingly stops, and Kaede is left wondering if Angie’s somehow still alive when a hammer on strings descends from the sky as well. It barely has to touch her statue, and—despite it being made of wax—she shatters like glass. Kaede presses her hands over her mouth in horror and barely registers Monodam rushing in to the ground the hammer for himself and smash it against Monokuma’s statue.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then it’s over.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam begins to go on in his stilted voice about how he’ll be running the game to ensure everyone gets along from now, but his words barely register for anyone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “Why did this have to happen? Why…” she doesn’t say it aloud, but her thoughts scream <i>why can’t I save anyone?</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s the next to speak. “Well, then. I suppose there’s one last thing to do then.” Kaede blinks up at her in confusion and sees Maki move over towards Kokichi in a few quick strides. “If we kill the mastermind, the game ends here. Monokuma refused to let me do it before Angie’s execution, but Monokuma’s dead now apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam hops from foot to foot, ineffectively arguing that killing one of your friends is not getting along with them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her threats, Kokichi looks up at her calmly. “You’re going to kill me in front of everyone?” he says. “Geeze, Maki—everyone’s been saying how tired they are of this trial, and you want to make them do another one? Though it would be pretty short…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop talking,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to reach a hand towards him, and far faster than Kaede could have possibly expected, Kaito lunges forward to grab Maki’s wrist. She snaps her head to him. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his other hand still pressed to his side, Maki could easily get out of Kaito’s grip with little more than a flick of her wrist, but he stands his ground. His voice is labored and each word is spoken through gritted teeth when he says, “Stopping you from fucking killing yourself. Everyone has seen too much death today, and I’m not about to let anyone else die. I know you’re not a killer, and I’m not about to fucking let you change that, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki’s not a killer,” Kokichi muses from behind them. “Wow, Kaito, you’re pretty funny!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki doesn’t even turn to him, keeping her hard stare on Kaito. “If I kill the mastermind, this ridiculous game is over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re not a killer,” Kaito says. “Maybe you were fucking trained as an assassin, but that’s not who you have to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not listening to me,” Maki says. “If I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re not listening to me, either,” Kaito says. He winces again as he keeps going. “If you were a fucking killer, you’d have already thrown me aside, right? If that’s really what you wanted to do, you’d have already done it. But that’s not the person you are. I refuse to believe for a fucking second you want to be that kind of person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes but retracts her hand out of his slackening grip and takes a step back. Her choice words of retreat are, “Kokichi’s still the mastermind. Me not killing him now doesn’t change that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In spite of her words, Kokichi just smiles. “You’re really funny, too, Maki. Though it sure is a good thing I have my beloved Kaito to save me from the big scary assassin. And here I was starting to think Kaito couldn’t do anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns to tower over him, forcing Kokichi to crane his neck up to meet his eyes. “The hell is your fucking problem with me!?” he shouts in Kokichi’s face. “People are fucking dying, and you’re playing fucking games, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not playing games,” Kokichi corrects. “I’m playing <i>the</i> game. You know, like everyone not already dying should do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s words seem to strike something in Kaito, and he leans even closer to him if at all possible. He begins to hiss, “Stop fucking—” when he cuts himself off as his entire body seems to shudder, and his hand not gripping his side darts forward grab Kokichi’s shoulder to steady himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s face grows even paler, and his head jerks forward as he starts to cough. The sound of blood splattering against Kokichi’s forehead seems to echo through the now deadly quiet trial room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito falls to his knees, now coughing more blood up into one of his hands. Maki rushes forward to his side, and Kokichi wrenches himself out of Kaito’s grip with a near horrified expression Kaede has never seen him ever portray anything close to.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He runs past where Kaede is still kneeling with Tenko, and she can see the blood running down over his face between his eyes as he dashes inside the now open elevator doors without a word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki seems to be fussing with Kaito, quietly arguing with him about something under his breath as he keeps repeating, “I’m fine, I’m fine,” between coughs. He manages to support himself back up to a standing position and starts limping towards the elevator, even as blood keeps dripping down his chin. He yells, “The hell are you all fucking standing around for!?” and Maki trails after him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The quiet horror of everything they just witnessed seems to settle over everyone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a sigh. “So this is the end.” He sighs again and begins to head towards the elevator. “It doesn’t matter… none of this mattered…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shuffles after them, too, still mumbling, “we’re all gonna fucking die here. I’m gonna fucking die here,” under her breath, even as Kiibo calls her name and hurries to fall into step beside her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s left alone in the trial room with Tenko and Tsumugi, then. The latter looking rather ill as she says, “What’s going to happen now? We just… try to go back to how things were?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nudges Tenko’s shoulder slightly, and makes to pull them both up together as she says, “I don’t think there’s anything else we can do…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “Why did everything turn out like this? This is so horrible, and now everyone’s going to be suspicious of everyone, and things between all of us will be even worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words ring frighteningly true in Kaede’s ears. In a gravelly voice, worn out from crying, Tenko says, “Tenko still believes in her friends… there’s—there’s nothing else she can do now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her shoulder. “I still believe in you, too. Now,” she turns her head to the still open elevator doors, “we should probably catch up with everyone. I think… Kokichi would probably like to go wash his face off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi grimaces as she nods. “R-Right. I’ll go ahead then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She leaves them then, and after she disappears through the elevator doors, Tenko says, “Kaede, one of us is the mastermind, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says in a shaky voice. “I’m absolutely sure of it, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth forms a tight line. “Tenko is going to figure out who it is, and she’s going to do everything she can to stop them.” Her hands tighten into fists. “Tenko isn’t going to let them hurt anymore of her friends.” She shakes her head. “Tenko… I am never going to let this happen again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and they walk to the elevator side by side. Silently, in her mind, Kaede curses herself for ever thinking Tenko could be the mastermind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The elevator ride back up is the most uncomfortable yet. Kaede never realized before how much Kokichi constantly fidgeted or bounced in place until seeing him standing stock still in the far corner away from everyone else. However, everyone else is scattered, too. Without even turning her head, Kaede can see Ryoma’s isolation in a different corner and Miu raking her shaking hands through her hair with Kiibo vainly attempting to comfort her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the heavy silence, Kaede catches herself thinking that maybe Angie was right. Any sense of unification would be better than this.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When the doors open again, Kokichi sprints out without a word, and Kaede hurries the first few steps after him. Attempting to call or reach out to him now is out of the question, but she makes a note that he heads back towards the school rather than the dorms.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others move listlessly around her—Miu’s stomping, Kaito’s poorly disguised limping. Of course, the atmosphere of a funeral march seems rather appropriate. For all the strange talk of hope and coming out stronger Kiibo had done at the trial’s end, Kaede can’t feel anything over the result other than a deep hollowness. She is everyone’s leader, and she has absolutely nothing to say after what they just went through.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, Tenko softly calls out, “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, uh,” Kaede turns to her. “Tenko, I—” out of the corner of her eye, she sees the doors to the school swing shut behind Kokichi. “I’m sorry. I’ll be right back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sends her a concerned look but nods. “Okay…” she looks at the ground. “Then, goodnight, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” she swallows down the lump forming in her throat. “Right. I’ll see you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods again, and Kaede forces herself to look away from her grief to possibly catch up to Kokichi. She hurries along the path, and looking over her shoulder, Tenko seems so small. It’s almost a relief when she reenters the school, knowing there is no one else to run into.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede internally curses at herself for thinking that way before beginning her search of the school. After what Kokichi just went through, there are few places she can picture him running off to, and after a brief moment of hesitation, she pushes open the door to the boys’ bathroom to find him standing before one of the sinks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He turns at the sound of the door opening, and Kaede spies smears of blood running along the edges of his white sleeves and his bangs now wet with water sticking to his forehead. Now that there is no longer blood splattered between his eyes, Kokichi seems to have regained his composure almost completely and he puffs out his cheeks at her arrival.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” he chides. “Why’d you follow me here? I need my privacy! Of course,” he turns to face her, an easygoing smile already in place. “I knew it would be you. Well,” he presses a finger to his lips, “you or someone come to try and kill me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows that replying that no one would ever try such a thing would be a particularly outrageous lie. Instead she says, “We need to talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s expression shifts to one of amusement. “Oh? But we just talked for an awfully long time at the trial, didn’t we?” He begins sniffling and starts rubbing at his eyes. “Everyone even kept telling me to shut up… everyone’s so mean—thinking I’m the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I don’t,” Kaede says letting out a sigh. “In fact, I think that we managed to confirm for each other that neither of us is the mastermind. But,” she frowns, “you thought I was, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He tilts his head. “That’s silly. What gave you that idea, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reminds herself that she knew this conversation would be frustrating going in, and she steels herself with her next response. “You thought either me or Miu was the mastermind, right? That’s why you did what you did before the blackout. You were trying to keep Himiko safe, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond. Kaede sighs again and keeps going, bashing his own evidence over his head. “You gave Himiko Miu’s EMPs so she could protect herself if Monokuma or an Exisal came after her, right? And then you purposefully singled out me and Miu to stop either of us from coming after her physically.” She shakes her head. “I know you like to play tricks on people, but I refuse to believe you did all of that for no reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it doesn’t matter!” Kokichi says brightly. “Because I guessed wrong, and I didn’t get photos of the mastermind’s super not-secret lair either, so who cares?” He huffs and crosses his arms. “Total failure. Back to the drawing board for me, I guess...”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says, taking a step towards him. “I know we… figured this out under awful circumstances, but this means we’re one of the few people that we can trust.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He raises an eyebrow at her. “Hmm? I thought my fearless leader Kaede trusted everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She winces. “You know what I mean. I’m saying that now we can work together—you and me and Tenko and, even if she’s kind of in a panic right now, Miu, too. If we all work together, I’m sure we can figure out something to stop the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks at her warily before turning to pick at his fingernails. His silence is all the answer Kaede needs to understand exactly how this conversation is going, and she takes another step towards him. “I get that we haven’t been getting along and that this doesn’t mean we’re friends. I used to say that I wanted to become friends with everyone, but…” she tries to smile at him even as he radiates a quiet but unwavering hostility. “Even if we can’t be friends, we can still help each other and save everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He watches her silently for another moment. Then, “see, Kaede, here’s the thing,” he says disinterestedly, “maybe you’re not the mastermind, but you’re still a killer.” He folds his hands behind his head with a bright smile. “And I really don’t need your help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes flicker over him. She isn’t offended. She’s just… “So, you’re going to stop the killing game all by yourself? Is that your new big plan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keep smiling. “Kaede, you’re smarter than the others, so I’ll let you in on a little secret. This game is a fight between me and the mastermind—everyone else is just a pawn. Kaito, Maki, even Miu—none of them are really good for anything other than being manipulated. That’s why I decided to work with Himiko, and why the mastermind sent Angie a victim—it all keeps the game between us moving.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is all too aware that his words are weighed to make her denounce him and storm out of the room. His expression is demonic, and Kaede knows that attempting to see through to whatever his true intentions are is likely beyond her, but even so, his words can only obscure the truth of his actions so much.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” she says carefully. “Are you afraid of trusting someone… or are you afraid of getting someone killed again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs. “Aw, Kaede—it’s so cute that you think I still care about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you do,” Kaede persists. “If you didn’t care about what happened to Himiko, then you wouldn’t have—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi begins to skip around her towards the door. “Himiko this, Himiko that. You’re really starting to sound like Tenko, you know, and two Tenkos would be soooo boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw as she turns to keep staring at him. “I…” she shakes her head. “I don’t know why you’re lying to me about this. Maybe you don’t think much of me or the others, but we still both want to end the killing game. Refusing to put our differences aside isn’t just childish, it’s,” she takes another breath, “it’s really dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think hanging out with a murderer is more dangerous, buuuut,” Kokichi hums. “I guess we just see things too differently, Kaede!” He sticks his tongue out. “And the real mastermind’s probably super mad at me right now. If I hang out with a murderer, I’ll be the next victim for sure!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For all of the patience she talked herself into beforehand, Kaede can’t help shouting at him. “I’m not going to kill you!” she yells. “Yes, I killed Rantaro, and I am going to spend everyday of my life regretting that and hating myself for it—is that what you wanted to hear!? But this isn’t about that!” she jabs a finger at his chest. “This is about you being too stubborn, and-and—and <i>arrogant</i> to listen to anyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just raises an eyebrow. “And?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her temper flares, and Kaede makes a point to tower over him as she hisses, “and you’re going to get yourself and probably a lot of other people killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know,” he says plainly. “For someone who claims they want to work together and be best friends, you sure are making a lot of threats, don’t you, Kaede? Maybe you will be the one to kill me, after all.” He tilts his head. “I have to wonder if you gave this much warning to Rantaro and Shuichi, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely resists the urge to slap him across the face. “Fine,” she says through gritted teeth. “Do whatever you want.” She’s far too aware of how childish her stomping back to the door is. “If you want to play hero, I can’t stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pushes the door to the boys’ bathroom open, and hears him calling after, “I could say the same to you, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I'm going to try to not let super irregular updates become a thing, but I am going to be getting busier at the end of the month so we'll see! Also this fic is at 500 kudos which is absurdly amazing! All I can say is thank you, thank you, thank you! I also attempted to do something interesting with the theory armament section... unsure how well it worked out, haha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also, to say a few words, I've always thought Angie was a more complex character than she's often given credit for, however, for me she also wins the award for the character canon seems the most confused about. Though I haven't actively been reading other rewrite stories, I am aware that a few of them (2? 3?) make similar choices in having Angie as the chapter 3 culprit, since it gives her arc a more definitive end than that as in canon. Or, at least, that's why I did it, haha. All I can really do is apologize for my lack of originality (and to few people who I particularly know were hoping for a different outcome) and hope this chapter wasn't too lackluster as a whole!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Every part of Kaede’s body feels heavy when she wakes up the next day. For perhaps the first time since the killing game started, she stays in bed after the morning announcement, staring up at her ceiling, feeling something dangerously close to helplessness. She plays her conversation with Kokichi from the day before over and over in her head between the images of Gonta and Himiko’s corpses with burning flashes of Angie’s execution filtered between them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Again, she thinks, <i>why can’t I save anyone?</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi’s last words had been to find the mastermind and save everyone. Kaede presses the heel of her palms into her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her doorbell rings, then, and Kaede isn’t sure whether to be irritated or thankful for it. Whoever’s on the other side seems to be waiting politely after their first ring as Kaede slowly makes her way to the door. That rules out Kaito as her visitor, leaving only one other person Kaede assumes it could possibly be.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s left blinking in surprise when it’s not Tenko, but Tsumugi who greets her. Though she wouldn’t consider Tsumugi someone she’s on bad terms with, the unfamiliarity between the two suddenly causes Kaede to become all too aware of her mused hair and slouched posture as she stutters, “O-Oh, uh, good morning, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, good morning to you, too, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “I hope I didn’t wake you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no,” Kaede says quickly. “I was, um, just getting up.” She reaches up to fiddle with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “Uh, Tsumugi, if you don’t mind me asking, why are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh, of course!” Tsumugi says. “I just wanted to ask if we were still going to be meeting in the cafeteria this morning. I started heading there, but, um,” she hugs one of her arms to herself. “On my way there, I saw Tenko and asked her, and… she said she’d really rather not since Himiko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces. “Right. Um,” she bites her lip. “Do you know if the others are still heading there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “I don’t really know what anyone’s doing anymore…” she lets out a trembling sigh. “We all need to work together to explore and find the new Flashback Light so we can figure out why this is happening to us, but everyone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut for a moment before stepping out into the hall and closing her door behind her. “Here,” she says. “Let’s head there together anyway, and see if the others had the same idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What about Tenko?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll find her later,” Kaede says. “And… Tenko probably would like a little time alone right now. Ryoma, too, maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “R-Right. And Kaito and Kokichi and Maki probably… aren’t speaking to each other, and Miu seemed really—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know!” Kaede interrupts a touch too forcefully, causing Tsumugi to flinch. “I mean, I know. And… I’ll deal with all of that later. But now, let’s just go to the cafeteria, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods again, and they begin the walk in relative silence as Kaede mentally goes over the list of people not currently falling apart at the seams. Herself, Tsumugi, and Kiibo. She pulls her hat lower over her eyes. Before, each murder had blindsided her, now, Kaede can almost physically feel time slipping away and towards the next breakdown.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the doors to the cafeteria, Tsumugi says, “Um, Kaede, I’m sorry for what I said earlier. I didn’t mean to just list off all of our problems like that, but I guess,” she sighs and hugs herself. “I guess I’m just really scared.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten, and she tries to smile sympathetically at her. “Yeah… I think,” she sighs, “being scared is pretty reasonable right now. I’m…” and Kaede furrows her brow as she thinks. Is she frightened? For herself? For everyone else? For—</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes too long to answer, and Tsumugi prompts, “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sorry,” Kaede says shaking her head. “I’m,” she decides to lie, “I’m pretty scared, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles back. “Ah, well, I guess it’s not great that we both feel that way, but it’s a little nice to know you’re not alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Yeah,” she says, “it is,” and pushes the doors open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s deadly quiet in the cafeteria, but, as Kaede glances around, she realizes it’s a small miracle that everyone besides Tenko and Miu are there.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sits at one end of the table by himself, not even turning at the sound of the doors opening. Kokichi’s at the other far end, though it’s more questionable whether his isolation is self-imposed or not. He’s cheerfully swinging his short legs back and forth and calls out, “Morning, Tsumugi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can only roll her eyes at his pointed, childish lack of address towards her, and she and Tsumugi awkwardly move to sit with Kaito, Kiibo, and Maki hovering slightly behind the former like a shadow. All too aware that there’s no Tenko around to leap to her defense, Kaede makes sure to put the others between herself and Maki as she sits, saying, “Good morning, everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grunts, and Kaede can’t help but look between him and Kokichi. It seems the days of the likely irritating but lighthearted teasing between the two are gone. Any chance either will talk about the other day seems just as nonexistent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “Good morning, Kaede and Tsumugi. I attempted to greet Miu this morning, however she insisted on going straight to her lab. I am aware we likely need to begin exploring the school soon after Monoku—after whoever is in charge now shows up, but I would like to take a moment to deliver her breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s a nice idea, Kiibo,” Kaede says simply. “I… will try to do the same for Tenko, wherever she is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From his spot at the far end of the table, Kokichi says, “Ooh! Ooh! What if she’s dead? Man, the game’s moving really fast now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without looking up, Ryoma says, “Shut up. Just shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, he does, and the silence that fills the room at Ryoma’s words rings heavily in her ears.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede plainly finds herself at a complete loss for words. At the end of the trial, Tsumugi had said they needed to go back to normal. Kaede stares down at her breakfast. Adjusting to her friends’ deaths was their normal. It had been for so long, but only now does Kaede feel a deep hollowness.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She keeps staring down. One of the people in the room with her right now is the mastermind. Kaede ticks off the people it could be and blandly realizes she has a one in five chance of guessing right, and suddenly she doesn’t feel like eating anymore. She pushes her plate away, thinking how she isn’t afraid.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam shows up then, the remaining two Monokubs huddled together behind him. The strange overtly robotic bear looks around the room and announces in its stilted voice, “EVERYONE-IS-NOT-GETTING-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “No shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam’s robotic face seems to darken at his comment, and Tsumugi quickly says, “Oh, um, did you bring more stuff to help us explore the school?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a sigh, Kaede stands and walks over to tower over the three stuffed animals. “Here,” she holds out a hand towards Monodam. “I’m the leader again, and I’m… going to make sure everyone gets along.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, Kokichi laughs. “But we’re getting along great now, Kaede! You and me and super gross Kaito are all the best of friends, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends him a weary look over her shoulder before turning back to Monodam. “What do you have for us this time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam hesitates for a moment before shuffling behind his back to present a paintbrush in one round paw and a circular stone in the other. “PLEASE-USE-THESE-TO-EXPLORE-THE-SCHOOL-AND-BECOME-BETTER-FRIENDS. EXPLORING-TOGETHER-WILL-HELP-EVERYONE-TO-GET-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes them. “Only these two?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stands to inspect the items in her hands. “Perhaps we are nearing the end of unexplored areas.” With a touch of uncertainty, he reaches forward to gingerly take the stone from Kaede’s hand. “If you do not mind, I believe I might know where this goes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Alright. I guess we can split up then—you can lead a group with that one and I’ll search with the others to figure out what to do with the paintbrush.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“BUT,” a distressed Monodam says. “SPLITTING-UP-IS-NOT-WORKING-TOGETHER.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also I don’t wanna go with Kaede <i>or</i> Kiiboy,” Kokichi pouts, jumping to his feet as well. “Man, and here I was hoping this exploration wouldn’t be totally boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito huffs. “If we’re splitting up, I’m going with Kaede, and Kokichi can fucking go with Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “But I just said I don’t wan—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t fucking care what you want!” Kaito yells at him. “I just want you out of my fucking face!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kokichi’s tears evaporate. “Hey, Kaito,” he says. “Why are you angry? Is it because everyone finally knows how weak you are? Are you afraid you’ll be the next victim?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens his mouth to shout again, when Maki quickly interrupts, “that won’t happen. Now,” she turns to Kaede. “I suppose we’ll be investigating together, then. Don’t slow us down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just rolls her eyes. “Didn’t you once say you’d rather choke on glass than team up with me and Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares at her before turning to fiddling with her hair silently.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam says, “YOU-ARE-GETTING-ALONG-BETTER-NOW. BUT,” he raises his paw again, a thin keycard held in it, “THERE-IS-ONE-MORE-ITEM. THE-MOTIVE-WILL-BE-GIVEN-NOW, TOO, TO-ENSURE-COOPERATION-AND—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“M-Motive?” Tsumugi stutters. “Already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs as he finally walks over to the others. “Not satisfied, huh? Haven’t made us suffer enough, yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “This is unfortunate, however, a keycard as a motive means it likely unlocks an area that contains something that would cause someone to attempt murder. The obvious solution in that case is to simply not use it, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mine!” Kokichi shouts, darting forward and swiping the keycard out of Monodam’s paw.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito immediately shouts, “Hey!” as Kokichi speeds out the doors. “Come the fuck back here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He charges off after him, leaving Kaede blinking in confuse at what just happened. There’s an odd expression on Maki’s face as she says, “I’ll retrieve the keycard. I doubt Kaito can run for long. Ryoma,” she turns to him. “You’re also fast. Tackle Kokichi for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma rolls his eyes. “And I’d do that because?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“E-Everyone calm down,” Kaede says, recovering. “There’s no reason to hurt Kokichi, even if he—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi wants to keep the game going,” Maki answers simply. “He’s said so himself enough times. Clearly whatever he’s up to concerning a motive will result in another murder if he goes unchecked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens and closes her mouth. “I…” her thoughts race. “I… don’t know about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs as she brushes past her. “I don’t know what is going on between the two of you, and I don’t care. But if both of you keep up your nonsense, there’s going to be another killing, and I am not going to allow that. The sooner we end this stupid game the better,” paused in front of the cafeteria doors she says again, “Ryoma, search for Kokichi, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then she leaves, and Kaede’s left fiddling with her hat as she thinks about everything Kokichi said the other day again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the uncomfortable silence following the doors swinging shut, Monodam says, “EVERYONE-IS-SUPPOSED-TO-EXPLORE-TOGETHER-TO-BECOME-FRIENDS.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma ignores him as he pulls his hat down. “Don’t feel like wandering aimlessly around the school. Sorry, Kaede.” He sighs again. “Don’t know what the hell stopping Kokichi will do either, but maybe Maki has a point. Guess I’ll look for him, too. Do something with myself…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah,” Kaede says, not having the heart to argue with him. “Um, tell me what you find, alright? I… don’t really trust Kokichi or Maki to tell me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods as he pushes the doors open. “Got it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, um,” Tsumugi says. “Are just the three of us exploring then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“THIS-IS-NOT-WHAT-I-WANTED…” Monodam mumbles to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “It would seem that way. Kaede, Tsumugi, the two of you should go together. If my prediction for this object is correct, then I should at least be able to explore with Miu, if,” he frowns, “I can manage to convince her to leave her lab, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s,” Kaede searches for the words. “Not doing well, is she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Miu was near inconsolable after the trial. I am becoming very worried for her metal health also,” he stares at the ground. “If this is not too odd to say, ever since I discovered Miu during the investigation and thought her to be dead, I have begun to reassess my feelings about our relationship.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede says. “What do you mean? You two are still friends, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct, however,” Kiibo frowns as his face begins to grow red, “I realized then how much I did not like thinking about what I would do without Miu around. I am doubtful she experienced a similar experience, however, I…” he presses his fingers together, “I am debating telling her how I felt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clasps her hands together. “A robot learning to experience love! Oh, how romantic! This is just like…” she frowns. “Actually I’ve seen this plot a lot, but it’s still plainly romantic, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I do not know if I would call it love,” Kiibo says quickly, face still burning. “I simply… care for her very deeply.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles at him. “I think it’s sweet. And I also think Miu would be really happy to hear she has someone like you around right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yes, right now my main goal is merely to be supportive, so,” he moves to the doors, obviously trying to flee the room in his embarrassment. “If you’ll excuse me, I must be going.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a dreamy sigh as his footsteps fade away. “Maybe it’s silly to get caught up in romance given our situation, but it’s so nice to hear about something so plain and normal, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-AM-HAPPY-THEY-ARE-GETTING-ALONG,” Monodam interjects.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede ignores him. “Ah, I suppose, though,” she tugs at her hat and bites back her own hypocrisy. “Becoming really emotionally dependent on someone isn’t a great idea. Getting too attached, uh,” she shakes her head, “sorry. Forget it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks at her worriedly but says, “O-Okay. Um, should we,” she glances down to the paintbrush still held in Kaede’s hand, “the two of us should still go explore, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two set off, Kaede leading the way with her follower of one trailing behind.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before the doors to the cafeteria swing shut, Kaede hears Monodam repeat, “I-JUST-WANT-EVERYONE-TO-GET-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It doesn’t take much thinking to assume their mysterious object belongs somewhere on the fourth floor. Kaede says as much to Tsumugi, and they begin their search there with only the distant yelling of whatever chase is going on between the others echoing any protest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wander through the somehow even more oppressive halls, only stopping when Kaede hears a slight scrapping carrying out from inside the middle of the three rooms. She pauses just outside the empty doorframe, Tsumugi nervously at her side, and peeks in to see Tenko awkwardly trying to drag the large box where Gonta was killed by herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko jolts at the sound of her name, her pigtails fanning out behind her. “A-Ah, Kaede,” she stammers. “T-Tenko was…” she looks back to the box in front of her. “Tenko was just trying to move this back… back to Himiko’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her chest tighten as she takes a hesitant step into the room. All of the swords and Angie’s statues have since disappeared along with any sign of Gonta’s murder. Kaede pushes down just how uncomfortable the sudden emptiness makes her feel as she says, “Are you moving everything by yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Gonta’s body was already gone, but,” she bites her lip. “Tenko… didn’t like the idea of Himiko’s things being here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Tsumugi speaking up. “That sounds like a lot of work for one person. Have you been here since this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says turning to stare at the ground. “Tenko is sorry for not meeting with the others, but,” she squeezes her eyes shut. “Tenko really didn’t want—Tenko can’t…” she shakes her head. “Sorry…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay. You don’t need to apologize,” Kaede says softly. “No one would expect you to after yesterday. I mean, no one really expected me to do much after Saiha—” Ryoma’s words biting at her just how little she actually knew about Shuichi come rushing over her. She pulls at her hat. “I-I mean—you should do whatever you think will make you feel better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Tsumugi. “Um, if it matters, most people are just kind of doing their own things right now, so you shouldn’t feel bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems confused at her words. “Everyone is…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Tsumugi and I are exploring, but most of the others became distracted with… with the new motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s voice is small. “Already? B-But,” she looks hurriedly around the room, her hair spinning around her, “but Tenko hasn’t even—i-it’s was only yesterday that Himiko—” she cuts herself off, pressing a hand to her tired, red-rimmed eyes. “T-Tenko… should probably stop then. She should probably go try and help everyone because putting Himiko’s research lab back together… won’t help anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s okay,” Kaede says. “It’s a bit hard to explain, but we’re not even really sure what the motive is right now. Kaito’s handling it, and if he can’t then Ryoma or Maki probably will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s right,” says Tsumugi. “I’m sure between the three of them, they’ll stop Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks between them confusedly. Kaede says, “I promise I’ll explain later after Tsumugi and I finish exploring. And,” she takes another step towards her, placing a hand on Tenko’s shoulder. “I remember a very empathetic person once telling me that hiding your emotions or pretending they aren’t there doesn’t help anyone. Sometimes you need to put on a strong front but,” she offers her a reassuring smile, “I’d would rather work with someone who mourns their friends’ deaths rather than someone who acted like they didn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares searchingly at her before letting out a deep breath. “Tenko remembers when she said all that… it feels like so long ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does,” Kaede says, pushing her hat back slightly on her head. “But I still think about it. And my point is that you were there for me, so I’m going to be here for you, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods and begins brushing at her eyes again. “Kaede, you’re going to make Tenko cry,” she lets out a choked laugh. “Tenko looks really ugly when she cries, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede offers her a sympathetic smile. “So do I, but if that’s what you need to do, you should do it, and I’ll be ready to help you with whatever comes next, even if neither of us know what that is yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods again, still wiping at her eyes. “That sounds like a good idea, th-then,” she lets out a shaky breath and tries to smile back at Kaede. “Tenko will finish up here and see you later, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll be waiting,” Kaede says as she finally steps away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko waves goodbye, and Kaede exits to the room with a heavy heart, only to find Tsumugi awkwardly standing just outside the door. She immediately jumps back when Kaede looks at her, saying, “I-I wasn’t listening! I mean, I didn’t mean to listen in! I mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay,” Kaede says. “I didn’t mean to keep you waiting. We still need to explore the school after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods and follows after Kaede as she starts forward again, internally thinking just how little the universe stops after each and every death.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It takes little time to pinpoint the one plain, unadorned, and oddly locked door on the floor, and it reacts vibrantly to the paintbrush, bursting into colors before vanishing altogether. A bright red staircase stretches before them, and Kaede takes a deep breath as she begins her ascent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The fifth floor is beautiful. Ignoring the gaudy Monokuma statues adorning the staircase, the tall glass windows reflect down in such a way that Kaede can only think it looks like heaven. With Tsumugi still trailing behind her, she moves to stare out one of the windows almost instinctually.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede runs her hands over the glass, staring at her own distorted reflection as Tsumugi says, “It looks a bit like a church up here, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hums. “Yeah… I wonder if Angie would have liked it here or maybe,” she tries to smile but the glassy window before her reflects just how bad her attempt is. “Maybe Kirumi and Korekiyo, too—they liked elegant things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words seem to make Tsumugi uncomfortable, and she can see the other girl shifting awkwardly behind her. “Uh, maybe,” she says. “But, um, we should probably keep exploring…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Right,” and her hand falls from the window as she turns to face Tsumugi. “Let’s see what we can find.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For once, Tsumugi walks in front and she seems to almost naturally gravitate towards a door with pictures of clothing and wigs surrounding it. “Oh,” she says. “Do you think there’s a chance this could be my lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe.” Kaede begins to list off on her fingers. “The only labs left are Kaito’s, Kiibo’s, Kokichi’s, and, ah,” she can’t help but wince slightly, “Rantaro’s and Shuichi’s. A-And yours, too, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “Right. Um, Kaede,” she says. “If you don’t mind me asking, have you been back to your lab a lot since you first found it? I don’t mean to pry, but I know musicians usually need to stay in practice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede fiddles with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “No, I… have been letting it slip—a lot. It’s just,” she decides to tell the truth, “it’s just a little hard to focus on playing the piano when your friends are killing each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi fidgets. “Oh, well, I know that, but if you only focus on the killing game, well,” she shakes her head. “Wouldn’t you drive yourself crazy with paranoia or guilt or, um… sorry,” she turns away from Kaede and towards the door. “Let’s just, um, see what’s in here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door opens easily enough when Tsumugi twists the handle, and the two girls enter the near cavernous room, staring dizzily up at the vaulted ceiling. Kaede echoes her thoughts aloud, “This place is huge…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Tsumugi says. “It looks like there’re sets and supplies to make and store clothes… and oh!” she shuffles over to what Kaede realizes looks suspiciously like a bar. “I think this might be another set, but it looks fully stocked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows after her, much more hesitant as Tsumugi produces several bottles from underneath the counter, examining each label briefly before pulling out another. Kaede reaches forward to inspect one of the ways Tsumugi set aside, scanning the label as she asks, “Are these alcoholic?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, only some of them,” Tsumugi says. “I actually used to work at a bar part time to make a little extra money for my cosplays before I started getting sponsors. Ooh, Kaede, would you like me to make you a drink?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sends her a pleading look, and after briefly reflecting on how uncomfortable she has made the other girl so many times today, Kaede relents. “Sure, if you’ll have one with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course!” Tsumugi says. “Non-alcoholic ones, right? Unless you want a little that is…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll pass on that,” Kaede laughs awkwardly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi turns to focus on her drink mixing, laughing slightly as well. “That’s fair. To be honest, when I worked at a bar, if I wanted to focus on selling anyone alcohol, it was usually older men. It’s a little creepy, but they tended to tip better, speaking of which,” she shakes the drink in her hand before placing it in front of Kaede. “I know you said you’re mostly just focused on the killing game, but would you maybe mind gossiping with me a little?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow in confusion. “Gossip about what? And how does that relate to older men?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, well, it’s really only marginally related,” she waves a hand. “I mostly wanted to ask you if you liked anyone. Kiibo was talking about how much he liked Miu earlier, so I guess it’s just been on my mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares down at her drink. “Right. That’s,” she takes an experimental sip of her drink, “really sweet of him. But, um,” she reaches up for the brim of Shuichi’s hat, hoping Tsumugi will take the hint, “no, I don’t really think of anyone here like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah?” Tsumugi hums. “What about Kaito? You two seemed pretty close for a while, but then,” she snaps her fingers, “oh, is that why you don’t get along with Maki? Because you both like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no, nothing like that,” Kaede says quickly. “Kaito’s just a friend, but—” she frowns. “Wait, you think Maki likes him? But she’s… how can she like anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shrugs. “I’m not sure. I always assumed assassins weren’t supposed to get attached to people, but lately she’s always hovering around him. Maybe I’m reading too much into it, but I figured that meant she had a crush on him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes another sip of her drink to give herself more time to form a proper response. “I’ll… talk to him about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clasps her hands. “So it is a love triangle! Oh, how exciting—everyone loves a good love triangle.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like I said,” Kaede says. “Kaito and I are just friends. Besides,” she laughs again, “even if I was in the mood to think about anyone romantically, he’s not my type. His hair looks too much like an eggplant.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi presses a hand to her mouth as she giggles. “I guess that is true. I always thought of him as kind of handsome in a shonen hero kind of way, but now,” she shakes her head. “Ah, Kaede, you’ve ruined it—I’m never going to be able to look at him without thinking about eggplants now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re welcome,” she says, finishing off the last of her drink, leaving a slight, happy glow lingering between them. “You know,” she looks down at her empty cup. “I was a little hesitant about this at first, but that was nice. I haven’t really been able to just talk about nothing since,” since Rantaro died, “for a long time now. So,” she smiles up at her, “thanks for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No problem,” Tsumugi says. “To be honest, I’ve always felt a little distant from everyone else—so I’m always happy to hang out if you want another drink. Ooh, or to cosplay with me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe some other time,” Kaede says. “After all, we still have a bit more of this floor left to explore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “Right, and then we’ll also need to talk to Kiibo to see what he found, and then find the others to see about the keycard,” she sighs. “It just never ends, does it? I guess it isn’t useful to anyone to just take a break but,” she shakes her head. “I don’t know how you put up it, Kaede. I think I would just break down and never leave my room if I tried being responsible for everyone for more than five minutes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles wryly, absently fiddling with her empty glass. “Well, I don’t think I’ve been doing that great a job. Everyone just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cuts herself off as the sounds of the doors to Tsumugi’s lab opening suddenly echo through the spacious room and both girls whip their heads to see their new guest. Kaede immediately stands to see Kokichi, of all people, casually skipping towards them. Tsumugi says, “Kokichi? What are you doing here?” while Kaede just stares him down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He ignores her question instead quickly scampering along the side of the bar, standing on his toes to reach for the variety of bottles Tsumugi had set aside. “Ooh, are you guys getting drunk before you investigate?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sends Kaede a nervous look as she says, “Um, they’re nonalcoholic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All of them?” he asks, lifting one bottle to inspect the label as Kaede had done so before. “This one smells like alcohol… ooh! Maybe we could use these to get Kaito drunk before we cut off his leg!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just sighs. “And why would we do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because it hurts less when you’re drunk,” Kokichi says, pointedly answering the wrong question. “Or, at least, you care less when you’re drunk, but I don’t know!” He places it back on the bar a touch too roughly, causing Tsumugi to instinctively reach out to steady the wobbling bottle. “But Kaito’s doing super bad, especially since he fell again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Of all his statements, that one’s believable enough for Kaede to ask, “He did?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup!” he answers cheerfully. “Kaito’s really clumsy and gross, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” to Kaede’s surprise, Tsumugi sounds mildly disappointed. “You don’t have a crush on him anymore, do you? I’m never going to get a love triangle at this rate, and I had such high hopes, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede chooses to ignore her, asking, “Is anyone with him now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki-chan started whining at him if that’s what you mean,” Kokichi says, puffing out his cheeks. “But then Ryoma was really mean, and took the keycard when I looked over my shoulder at them.” He looks dejectedly at the ground, “I didn’t even get to find out what super special awesome place it unlocked…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi asks, “So Ryoma has it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks him over, instead asking, “Why are you telling us all this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her question catches Kokichi’s attention and he smiles slyly at her. “No reason. Just felt it was good to know. We need to share information if we want to prevent a murder, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at him, distantly aware of Tsumugi shifting uncomfortably in the background as the two of them have their stare off. “Um, well,” she says. “Kaede and I were just about to leave anyway to investigate more, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You should come with us,” Kaede says sharply. “Like you said, it’s good to share information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi quirks an eyebrow and seems to debate her proposal for a moment before saying, “lead the way, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are only two more sets of doors on the floor, and after a cursory check of the first one, Tsumugi cautiously guesses it likely requires another item from the Monokubs to open due to the strange keyhole. Kaede still attempts to shove herself against it, though Kokichi forces them her to abandon it when he pronounces his boredom and begins to skip away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The other door is rather plain and remains firmly shut when Kokichi twists the handle. Tsumugi says, “Oh, is this one locked, too? It’d be weird if we needed a second item for this place as well, especially since I don’t see anywhere to put one…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over the door and suddenly feels a growing pit in her stomach. “This… this is a research lab, isn’t it? And it’s locked because…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because it belongs to either Shuichi or Rantaro,” Kokichi observes coolly. “Hmm, we don’t have Gonta around to rip the door off anymore, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Pick the lock,” Kaede says sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said pick the lock,” Kaede repeats.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s eyes flicker over her for a moment, and Kaede doesn’t waver as she stares back at him. He shrugs. “Fine,” and kneels down in front of the door, pulling a thin wire out of his pocket before getting to work. “This is pretty exciting though—I wonder if this will be the lab for my beloved Shuichi or my beloved Rantaro. Either’s pretty great!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t acknowledge him, instead glaring hard at the door. The rational part of her says that Kokichi has no reason to go unnecessarily slow and likely isn’t, but time seems to stretch achingly on, with only the sounds of his fiddling and Tsumugi lightly shifting from foot to foot echoing around her. Kaede remains deadly still, half mentally preparing herself for whatever lies ahead, half questioning why she had been so confident this was a good idea.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then the door clicks, and Kokichi pushes it slightly ajar with one hand before standing again. “Done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pushes past him without a word into the small, almost cozy room. She takes two determined steps inside before screeching to a halt, even as Kokichi scampers around her, already poking and prodding at a shelf like a child in a toy store.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He swipes a random binder from a shelf, flipping through it wildly before turning it to face Kaede and Tsumugi still nervously hovering in the door, saying, “Look! Murder pictures!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He says more and Tsumugi says something back but it all sounds like static to Kaede who numbly takes in everything around her. There’s the shelf Kokichi’s slowly tearing apart lined with binders filled with images from crime scenes and another cabinet storing an immense set of vials and bottles and a few nice chairs and a strange fire and an overly elaborate clock and Kaede feels her chest tighten and bile rise up in her throat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s still chastising Kokichi when Kaede says in a voice just above a whisper, “This is Shuichi’s lab…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Looks like it,” Kokichi hums, shoving the binder haphazardly back on the shelf. “Which means it’s probably full of stuff to kill people with!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “Kokichi! How can you say that, Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” Kaede says quickly. “Let’s just…” she takes a deep breath. “It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips past her towards the cabinet full of bottles, saying in a sing-song voice, “And I thought someone was getting better at lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With too much of her energy devoted to not simply falling to her knees, Kaede can’t even in find it in herself to glare at him. Instead she just squeezes her eyes shut and wills herself to stop playing Shuichi’s execution on repeat with each tick of the clock. He was never even here. He never knew this room even existed. The sight of the empty chairs makes Kaede want to vomit.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi must have mustered up the courage to approach her as her soft voice calls out, “Kaede?” from just behind Kaede’s shoulder. “Are you alright? You look kind of pale…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is it because this place is full of poison?” Kokichi asks standing on his toes to examine a bottle on a shelf slightly above his head. “That would make me pretty nervous!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words cause something to click in her head and Kaede whips towards him. “Poison?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles brightly as he pulls two bottles off the shelf, turning to show her their labels. “Deadly poison and deadly poison antidote,” he announces before slipping them both into one of his pockets. “I think I’ll just save these for later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks horrified. “You’re just going to carry around poison!? W-Why on earth would you do something like that!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede instead moves past him to begin scanning the shelf. Each bottle before her details either the traumatic effects it will wreck on the human body or how quickly it needs to be administered to prevent just that. Tsumugi and Kokichi are still arguing. Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “Why are there so many horrible things here? This place is like it was built for a criminal…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi spins on his heel. “It was Shuichi’s job to catch criminals, right? So it makes sense that he’d need to study them lots and lots.” He taps a finger to his chin. “Aaaand he did end up becoming a criminal anyway, so it seems like a perfect fit, right Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s hands tighten into fists at his challenge. Tsumugi begins to scold him for saying such things and Kokichi starts sniffling about how he’s just telling the truth. Kaede says quickly, “I have to go,” before sprinting out of the room without another word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her entire body feels too hot and too sick, and she’s only half aware she’s brushing the beginnings of tears away by the time she reaches the bottom of the staircase. And she feels so, so guilty for it as Ryoma’s words come flooding back to her again. Another part of her reminds herself how long ago it was that she last felt this way and just how much she managed to forget. And then Tsumugi echoing how she’s responsible for everyone comes flowing over everything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede manages to make it dazedly back to the second floor when she hears footsteps behind her and Tenko’s voice calling out, “Kaede?” she hears her jog over. “Is everything—are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something about seeing Tenko makes her feel even worse for crying, and she wipes at her eyes as embarrassment surges up through her. “I’m fine—” she remembers her own words to Tenko only moments ago. “No, I’m really not, but I just need a minute.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks unconvinced, and Kaede adds, “Really. I just,” she takes a deep breath, “I just happened to find Shuichi’s talent lab, and I,” she forces a choked laugh. “I wasn’t as ready for it as I thought I was. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pauses. “Kaede,” she says. “If you’re not feeling up to it, Tenko understands, but she actually wanted to ask you for a favor that might help a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede blinks. “What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko was,” she sighs. “Tenko was thinking about what you said to her again and about the first time Tenko said it, and,” she bows her head slightly, “Tenko was wondering if maybe you could play that song for her—the one you wanted to play for Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s heart seizes up. “You want…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko understands if—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s okay,” Kaede says. “That actually sounds really nice… I,” she tries to smile, “I haven’t touched a piano for so long—I’m probably really rusty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles back. “That’s okay. Tenko just wants to hear Kaede play. She thinks it would make Himiko and Shuichi and everyone else really happy, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They fill the walk to Kaede’s talent lab with soft small talk, and Kaede brushes her fingers over the long since untouched piano keys as Tenko sits down beside her. She runs almost absently through scales, but even after weeks of no practice, everything flows through her as if second nature. Even as her warm-ups go on too long, Tenko never seems bored or impatient, simply calmly watching her fingers fly across the keys.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede starts Clair de Lune without announcing it and the soft melodies soar through the room, and with each movement of her hands, she recalls a time when she sat in a sunset swept classroom, placing her own hand over one of Shuichi’s and telling him everything would be okay. She risks a glance towards Tenko to see the other girl sitting calmly with her eyes closed, looking more relaxed than she has all day, and wonders which time with Himiko she’s thinking about.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When she finishes, Tenko softly says, “Again, please—just a bit longer,” and Kaede starts from the beginning without protest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They spend too long there. After her second play through, Tenko asks if there are any other songs Kaede would like to play, and the day wears on as they sit listening to each melancholy song Kaede can find the music for.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They finally leave when Tenko quietly mentions she has yet to eat anything since yesterday morning, and Kaede offers to get her something from the cafeteria. She manages to make the entire trip there without running into anyone until she enters the room in question to find Kiibo who immediately perks up at her presence. “Kaede,” he says. “I’ve been looking for you and Tenko. I am ready to report my findings.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede absently realizes the killing game had yet to stop just because she and Tenko sealed themselves away from everything for a few moments. “Right,” she says. “Um, where are the others, too, if you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I also came to report that as well,” he says. “In their pursuit of Kokichi, the others managed to find the Flasback Light and are waiting for everyone in the gym.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that sounds… really important,” she says. “I’ll, um, I’ll get Tenko and meet you there then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “Understood. I will report to the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He leaves, and Kaede just stares at the ground and sighs as all the weight she had felt leave her body comes rushing back in with his reminder of their reality. She grabs an apple for Tenko and speed walks back to her lab to deliver the bad news.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When they enter the gym, Maki says, “Finally.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaede,” Tsumugi says, still looking worried. “Are you alright? You ran off, and I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m fine,” she says quickly before squaring her shoulders. “I guess we should just do this like the first time—what does everyone have to report?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s standing almost protectively in front of a fidgeting Miu and says, “I managed to discover my own lab, which connects to Miu’s. However,” he frowns, “there was not much of interest there, and it was rather disappointing as a whole. I doubt I will spend much time there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu waves a hand. “Just a bunch of robot upgrades—doesn’t matter for anyone who’s not Kiibs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Kaede and I—and I guess Kokichi, too—unlocked the fifth floor and found my lab, and, um,” she looks at the ground. “Shuichi’s lab, too. Kokichi picked the lock, so anyone can go in there now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki quirks an eyebrow. “And was there anything of interest?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Juuuust poison!” Kokichi says happily. “Good thing Kaede made me unlock it, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“P-Poison!?” Miu stutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko quickly leaps to her defense, “Kaede could not have known that would be there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s true!” Tsumugi adds. “There was no way she could have known.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Regardless,” Ryoma says with a sigh. “That’s one more weapon we have to use against each other…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And attempting to dispose of it would likely be pointless,” Maki says. “Monokuma or whoever would probably just restock it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu mutters under her breath, “have to make all of my own fucking food now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clears her throat. “So that’s my group and Kiibo’s.” She turns to Maki. “What happened with the keycard?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “After Kokichi fucking took off with it, Ryoma grabbed it from him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was really mean, too,” Kokichi pouts. “Running that fast is so not fair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Ryoma has it?” Kaede asks, ignoring him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “Gave it to Maki after she finished taking care of Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She didn’t fucking take care of me!” Kaito shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi asks. “Is there another word for acting as your human crutch to take you back to your room because you couldn’t do it by yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito growls. “Well obviously I’m fucking fine now, so all of you can back off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “Maki has it? Did you figure out where it goes to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “No, I didn’t, but I will be holding on to it for safekeeping. If nobody discovers the motive, there won’t be a murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds like a good idea,” Kiibo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Wait—isn’t this like the motive with the Monokubs’ pads? Wouldn’t it be best if we all just go look at the motive together so we can talk about it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh, yeah!” says Kokichi. “I wanna see! I wanna see!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “We don’t even know where it goes to, which means,” he pulls his hat down. “Actually avoiding this one altogether is probably the best idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” says Maki. “And forcing everyone to view the motive will only increase the likelihood of a murder—not decrease it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw,” Kokichi pouts. “But me and Kaede should really see so we know who to watch out for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What? Why just us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because if you’re going to kill someone,” Kokichi says, his face turning dark. “Wouldn’t you kill someone who actually knows how to solve a mystery?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a sudden rush of something cold slide down her neck. “I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shouts, “That will not happen! Tenko will protect Kaede at all costs!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“S-So,” Kokichi starts sniffling. “W-Who will protect me when Harumaki-chan tries to kill me again?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki snaps, “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “I just said I didn’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki takes a step towards him, only to be cut off by Kaito saying, “Maki—he’s not worth it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her glare doesn’t leave her face, even as she abruptly stops moving. “Whatever. I’m still going to kill you and end this ridiculous game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, if we’re all done threatening each other,” Ryoma says. “Flashback Light—Maki found it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right,” says Tsumugi. “Maybe we can finally figure out something about that weird group funeral.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or why the fuck we were being hunted down like rats,” Miu mutters darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives them a once over before pulling it out and flicking it on without a word of warning.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then Kaede sees white. The same searing, burning feeling surges over her as it did so many times before, and then—then meteors fall from the sky by the hundreds, thousands, and the streets scream with protesters and shouting about the end of the world and there’s death and disappearances and all of humanity at the very brink of destruction.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then she’s standing back in the gym, breathing heavily as the world ending fades out around her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu lets out a wordless scream, falling to her knees, and clawing at her hair. Kiibo quickly moves to her side, but she keeps chanting, “this is hell, this is hell, we’re all in f-fucking hell!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Through gritted teeth, Kaito snaps, “We’re not fucking dead—quit saying that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu keeps mumbling to herself, her words becoming indistinguishable as she presses her hands to her face. Despite clearly being a bit shaken himself, Kiibo says, “Miu, please try to calm down—you’re safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo, bad lie, Kiiboy,” Kokichi says. “She’s in a killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s entire body flinches as any weight Kiibo’s words of comfort had evaporate.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But,” Tsumugi says. “What was that? I-Is the world outside really like that? I remember…” she shakes her head, “I remember my neighborhood… it was overrun with those people talking about how the world was going to end…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mine, too,” Ryoma says, voice quiet. “It was impossible to avoid them…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “There was something else, right? T-Tenko remembers there being a plan of some kind—the Gophel plan—but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It failed…” Kaede finishes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito presses hand to his forehead. “The fuck does all this mean? Is the world really…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu whimpers. “A-Almost everyone’s fucking dead, and we’re trapped in hell with no fucking way to get out…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not true,” Kokichi says. “There’s always graduation after all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“D-Don’t say that!” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he tilts his head. “Why not? Someone here’s probably thinking about it right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only one thinking that shit is you,” Kaito say harshly. “None of us would—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But again and again some of us have!” Kokichi says. “Geeze, Kaito do you ever learn?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Knock if off, both of you.” He moves to leave the gym. “I’ve had enough of this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “I-I think I’m going to go back to my room. I… need to go lie down for a little while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They exit without protest, and Kaede hears Kiibo softly say, “Miu, I can escort you back to your room if you need help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She allows Kiibo to slowly pull her to her feet even with his meager strength barely supporting her. They walk past Kaede on their way out, and she can barely make out Miu’s increasingly distressed mumbling. “Hell… hell—I’m in <i>fucking</i> hell…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After the doors swing shut, Tenko suddenly says, “Tenko thinks maybe this is a trick—maybe Monokuma is simply trying to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki answers, speaking up for the first time since turning on the Flashback Light. “There’s no reason to think this one would be fake after all the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “That’s one way to look at it, buuut,” he folds his hands behind his head. “I think we’re still missing a pretty important piece—maybe one more Flashback Light and everything will fit together!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, he merrily skips out the doors of the gym as if he hadn’t also just been privy to seeing the world end.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “I need to go check something. Kaito, you should lie down as well. Stress—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m fine,” he says. “What I really need is for everyone to stop fucking fussing over me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki frowns. “I’m going then,” and she walks out the gym without a word to either Kaede or Tenko still standing by the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs and presses a hand to his face. “Well,” he says. “Guess it’s been a pretty fucking long time since it was just the three of us, at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “Though Tenko should actually probably leave to go eat,” she turns to her. “Did you eat the apple I gave you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, not yet,” Tenko says. “But Tenko will, um,” she looks between the two of them. “Kaede, will you be alright if Tenko leaves?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pulls a face. “Are you still saying that just ‘cause I’m a guy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Awful boys tend not to be aware of others feelings,” she says. “And you are very likely to say something rude to Kaede, intentional or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes, and Kaede can’t help but smile at their familiar banter. “I will not. I always fucking think about what I say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doubts that,” she says. “But… Tenko is also very hungry. Goodbye, Kaede, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bye,” Kaede calls after her as she leaves.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone together for the first time in so long, Kaito forces a smile. “Been a while since we could just talk. Like,” he grins, “can’t believe you fucking tried to join a cult without me—I turn around for one second and you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Things have been pretty intense lately, haven’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “Hate to fucking admit Kokichi’s right about anything, but I’ve kinda been out of the loop for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not your fault,” Kaede says. “Especially since,” she frowns, “that actually reminds me—do you think Maki has a crush on you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks. “What? If she does this is the first I’ve fucking heard about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So she hasn’t said anything?” Kaede asks. “And you don’t like her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He furrows his brow. “Uh, haven’t really thought about romance a whole lot. I mean, she’s nice and I think she needs a friend and shit, but,” he shakes his head, “why’re you asking me about this anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi was talking about it,” Kaede answers. “She seemed really interested in the idea of a love triangle or something going on between us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Between you, me, and Harumaki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, first us and then you, Maki, and Kokichi,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “Wonder where the hell Tsumugi got that fucked up idea. Maybe all that anime’s rot her brain or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says with a teasing smile. “It is pretty hard to believe that many people would be interested in you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” he shouts, though half smiling. “Tons of people would wanna date me—maybe not a lot of people here but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In theory?” Kaede asks. “Back home did you—ah,” she cuts herself off. “Never mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems to catch where her words were headed. “Before the meteors and cults and shit?” he shakes his head. “Can’t fucking believe that’s what the outside world’s like…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess we can’t know for sure until we leave,” Kaede says, crossing her arms. “And hopefully that will be really soon. I’m starting to get really concerned about the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course you are,” Kaito says. “Trying to be the leader of half of us is probably shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smirks. “Thanks for the vote of confidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m serious,” he says. “Especially since I’ve been falling down on the job of stopping the mastermind like I fucking said I would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “You’re going to stop the mastermind? How… exactly are you planning on doing that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “If you say anything about I’m fucking hurt—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says quickly. “I meant more like,” she fiddles with the bill of Shuichi’s hat. “Like, what would you do if… not even if you knew who the mastermind was, but if you knew a way to stop them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d stop—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would you hurt them?” Kaede asks. “If it meant saving everyone else and ending the killing game… would you,” she swallows, “would you actually risk killing someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stops and stares hard at her. “What’re you asking me all that for? You feeling—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just,” she says quickly. “I just think we tend to see a lot of things the same way—maybe not everything, but a lot. S-So,” she takes a deep breath, “I want your opinion: what would you do if you knew you had a way to kill the mastermind, especially knowing that they’re one of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stops, going silent for an unexpectedly long time before saying, “I guess I’d need to think about it. Kaede—I’m serious—are you fucking feeling okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “I’m fine—just ignore me, alright? Seeing, um,” she looks down at the ground, trying to think of an adequate lie, “seeing Shuichi’s lab earlier kind of shook me up a little, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods, looking only half convinced. “Got it. I, uh,” he looks away, an unreadable expression crossing his face, “I think I’m gonna go find Harumaki. She’s been acting kinda weird, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that right?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he moves past Kaede to begin pushing the door to the gym open. “I know you guys don’t fucking get along at all, but she’s not a bad person, you know. She just needs a little push from time to time and shit. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede calls out, “I’m glad you can be that person for her,” and Kaito gives her a half-hearted smile before he disappears through the doors.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then Kaede finds herself alone with her guilt and her body feels as heavy as if she was carrying a hundred shot puts when she finally leaves.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And with this I think this fic might officially be the longest in the V3 tag, so thanks to everyone for sticking with me this far! Also I will be taking next weekend off from updating this fic since I'm going to be pretty busy and it's also my birthday :P Though I'll still probably be posting something.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s difficult for Kaede to feel much besides a general sense of failure and dread as she steps back into the hall. Kaito’s already ran off to be a friend to someone she can barely speak to, and with Tenko needing as few distractions from actually eating as possible, Kaede finds herself almost at a loss with what to do with herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She wanders down the halls near aimlessly for a few moments, replaying the images from the Flashback Light in her head as she stares at the dimming sky outside. Even with the fresh horror of all the memories she had somehow forgot newly fresh, between them and the sky, Kaede can’t help but find the latter more intriguing. Though the blackout as a whole had been a blur punctuated by death, the completely dark morning sky remained one of the few mysteries Kaede still actively wished to ruminate over upon remembering its existence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That alone is enough of an incentive to spur her into some kind of productive action, and she sharply turns on her heel to make her way outside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede walks with her head turned up, taking in the sky and bars running through it overhead, squinting her eyes to see if any clues would suddenly decide now is was a good time to reveal themselves. She recalls Gonta mentioning the differences in the stars and a distinct absence of any birds, planes or other signs of life. And with her trained ears, Kaede realizes she can’t hear the faraway sounds of any animals and never had since waking up in the cage.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s perhaps a bit too focused on these musing and her foot catches on a slate of rock protruding from the ground. She manages to stumble back a few steps instead of outright falling, and after recovering Kaede looks down to see something else Gonta had once mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The smooth rock is littered with a mismatch of carved letters, but as Kaede narrows her eyes at the markings, she notices some scratches seem shallower or unfinished—as if someone had started something only to give up part of the way through.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her musings are interpreted, however, by rather loud sounds of stomping suddenly coming towards her, along with Miu shouting, “Bakamatsu! Finally fucking found you!” over Kiibo’s quieter caroling pleads.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The brightness of the address is enough to pull Kaede out of her previous thoughts completely. “Miu?” she asks. “You… seem suddenly a lot better?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Up close, Kaede sees her statement was not quite correct, as Miu’s eyes still seem red, her face puffy, and her hair knotted into stringy tangles from raking her hands through it. Yet there’s an energy other than sheer panic surging through her even as her entire body still seems half ready to break down. “‘Course I’m fucking fine! I-I’m—” she jerks a thumb towards herself, “The gorgeous genius Miu Iruma—I’m a-always fine!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The tremor in her voice betrays her, and Kaede’s obvious skepticism is enough to prompt Kiibo into saying, “I escorted Miu to her room and sat with her for a few moments. I then left to go to my own room, when I suddenly heard her shouting about having a new idea—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-Bitchin’ brilliant idea!” Miu supplies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns, clearly still concerned. “And then when I attempted to go back to check on her, she instead left her room and said she needed to come find you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And here we fuckin’ are,” Miu says. “S-So, Bakamatsu—need you t-to do something for me, and, and it’s totally worth your while. I’m not the k-kinda person to not reciprocate after going do—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you need?” Kaede asks quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I got shit I need to do first, but, you,” she waves vaguely. “Y-You need to get everyone to come when I’m ready, since you’re the leader of this shitstain, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I’m… not sure I get it, but if you need me to call a meeting later, I guess I could try.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu nods, seemingly satisfied with that answer. “Better not fucking forget, a-and,” she looks between Kiibo and Kaede before lowering her voice and gesturing for them both to lean in closer. “Also—since last trial, I’ve been thinking ‘bout the, the shitty two person rule.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “You mean the rule saying the killing game ends when only two of us are left?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” she says too loudly, wincing at the sound of her own voice before returning to her whispering, which Kaede notes seems to involve entirely too much spit. “I-I mean, here’s what we fucking do: me and Bakamatsu get out, a-and I can just download your A.I. or something, Kiibs, and the three of us are home fucking free.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It takes Kaede a moment to process the implications of what she just said. “Wait, are you saying… we should work together to—I don’t know—outlast everyone else?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems just as hesitant as Kaede. “What about everyone else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu nearly snarls. “<i>Fuck</i> the others—one ‘em is the mastermind, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something about her words sets Kaede off. “And five of them aren’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The finality of her statement causes Miu to squeak. “A-All I’m fucking s-sayin’ is we need to work together, a-and shit, like,” she frowns, clearly searching for an example of such, “l-like when I clean Kiibs and shit, or when you told me about ankle-biter stealin’ my drone. O-Oh, a-and—!” She looks to Kiibo suddenly. “And what I was sayin’ about copying Kiibs’s A.I. is totally something I can do, by the way—so we wouldn’t be fucking leaving him behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo blinks. “You can copy me?” He places a hand to his chin. “Would that be equivalent to cloning? Miu, I am not sure about the ethical implications of—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck ethics!” Miu says. “It’d just be like you’re you and the toaster is also you—nothing fucking weird about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede would beg to differ, but she chooses to address the more pressing issue at hand. “Miu, I know that you’re worried about what… our discovery a while ago means for us because of what happened to Himiko, but we can’t just abandon the others to try and save ourselves.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods. “I agree. I think the three of us can still certainly work together, however I would prefer to continue trusting and relying on all my friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu leans back from them, shriveling up her nose. “F-Fine,” she turns away. “Fucking fine! It—it wasn’t a real offer just so you know. Great… great fucking inventor like me doesn’t need anyone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She begins to stomp off, and Kaede calls after her, “Do you still want me to call a meeting for you later?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, fuck!” Miu pivots on her heel. “Yeah—when I’m done with my shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, she runs off curiously towards the school rather than her lab or room, leaving Kaede and Kiibo in her wake. Kiibo stares after her for a few moments before turning to Kaede. “Kaede, perhaps this does not need to be asked, but you are also worried about Miu, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “I am—though I’m pretty worried about everyone,” she glances down to the stone slate. “And… basically everything about our situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo follows her gaze. “This,” he kneels down next to it. “Gonta mentioned this sometime ago, if I recall.” His metal fingers move over the letters, pressing into the shallower indents. “We still have yet to discover who is adding to the message, though I suppose there is little doubt it is one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and sighs as she looks down at it. “It has to be, and right now it looks like one of us wants to say…” she tilts her head, “‘The world is a horse thing.’ I’d write this off as a prank, but carving letters into stone isn’t exactly… funny, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo agrees. “It is also not a public spectacle.” He stands with a shake of his head. “There are many mysteries of this school that I still fail to understand. Apologies if this sounds insensitive, but it seems the killings we are forced into are almost a distraction from uncovering…” he frowns, searching for the words, “whatever the truth of our situation is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you mean,” Kaede begins. “The truth about our pasts and how we got here—like with the Flashback Lights? Or,” she furrows her brow, “or… well, at least I’ve been thinking about <i>why</i> someone would hold a killing game in the first place. If Monokuma or the mastermind or whoever just wanted us dead, they could have done it a dozen times over since they have the Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Kiibo says. “I have not thought as much on that, I am afraid. Though Monokuma has seemed insistent on the rules thus far.” He directs his gaze back to the ground, the weight of his next words seeming to almost physically weigh him down. “For instance… they only took action to directly interfere and kill Himiko when it was within their own rules to do so. Though it is horrible, I believe we can rely on the rules to predict Monokuma and whoever is controlling him’s behavior. Or,” he frowns, “Monodam, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but laugh slightly at his statement. “Right—I have to admit, I’m also curious about why that happened. It’s like,” she waves a hand vaguely, “it seems like something scripted, if that makes sense? Like something that would happen in a T.V. show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have not considered that,” Kiibo says. “I have studied the past of cinema’s creation, though I am not as familiar with modern T.V. dramas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Kaede smiles at him. “Maybe you could watch some when we all get out of here. All of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He senses the intent behind her words and nods determinedly. “Yes. When we all escape together,” he places his hands on his hips triumphantly. “I shall watch many T.V. shows. Miu has actually told me about a few, though I have the feeling they are for a younger audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His statement strikes Kaede as interesting enough, and she makes idle conversation with him as evening sets in. Only when the first strange stars begin to glitter in the sky does Kiibo excuse himself, citing his need to check up on Miu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As he runs off, Kaede becomes aware of her own responsibilities again. With night bearing down on her, Kaede wanders back to the dorms, trying to recall the last time she stayed out late to meet with the others. Perhaps Angie had had a point with her night rule—Gonta and Kirumi had both been killed at night and Himiko in the dark. Kaede’s throat tightens as she thinks how she was the only killer bold enough to make their move in broad daylight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stops abruptly in her tracks and self-loathing when her ears begin to pick up two voices Kaede has made it a point to pay special attention to arguing with one another.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Keeping her distance, she approaches the dorms slowly until Maki’s slight figure and Kokichi’s still smaller one become clearly silhouetted just outside the dorms, the lights from within neatly casting a spotlight over them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The first words she makes out are Kokichi saying, “—someone like you could probably make it through easy without us slowing you down, right? So it’s totally possible!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even from her far away position, Kaede can quite clearly see Maki glaring down at him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze, Maki,” he says. “For an assassin, you’re a terrible liar. Although I guess while you were studying knives, I was studying lies, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there a point to this?” Maki cuts in. “Or are you just going to keep babbling at me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just want you to tell the truth, Harumaki-chan,” he says. “Of course, you didn’t even tell Kaito the truth, so I guess I’m a lost cause, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She snaps, “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it helps moves things along,” Kokichi answers, not wavering even slightly, “then I don’t mind using my life, buuuuut I’m not dying yet, and you’re not gonna break your promise with Kaito, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stiffens, and Kokichi giggles. “You’re just too easy to read, Maki,” he says. “It’s almost boring. Still,” he folds his hands behind his head. “Kaito still gives you a pretty long leash, huh? Since you’re still keeping secrets from him, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki jerks forward, snatching the front of his scarf up in one fist and yanking it upward to force him on to his tiptoes. “Have you forgotten that I promised to kill you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The movement is enough to spur Kaede into action, and she jogs forward, making her footsteps purposefully loud. She forces her voice to sound as nonchalant as possible when she calls out, “Hey, Maki! What are you—did Kokichi do something again?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s head whips to her at the sound, and she nearly tosses Kokichi to the ground as Kaede approaches. “It’s nothing,” she says. “Kokichi just wanted to tell me he’s going to bed early tonight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t seem particularly disturbed by his situation and calmly sits up, brushing at the dirt on his now slightly less white clothing with a frown. “Maki’s a liar,” he says with a pout. “And I <i>hate</i> liars.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite feeling compelled to come to his defense only moments earlier, Kaede just raises her eyebrows at him. “Then… what did happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing,” Maki says again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Hey, Kaede, I thought you were a pretty bad liar, but Maki is so much worse at it, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s head snaps to him. “Do you want to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Be killed?” Kokichi finishes as he stands. “Geeze, Maki, you’re so predictable it’s not even funny.” He sighs and begins inspecting his nails. “Everything about you is so boring and predictable—just talking to you puts me to sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you’ll shut up and go to your room,” Maki says. “This conversation is over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts whining. “But—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smirk. “Maki, have you actually taken care of children before? You seem like a natural.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Instead of snapping at her, Maki turns to fidget with her hair. “I just have enough experience to know a brat is a brat,” she mumbles. “Age doesn’t matter if someone refuses to change…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi lets out another exaggerated sigh. “But, mom, I want to stay up and play with the other kids.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns her glare on him, her voice ice cold. “I am going to kill you. And if you don’t get out of my sight in the next five seconds, I will do it now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sticks his tongue out at her. “Fine! I don’t want to talk to you anyway!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches wearily as Kokichi skips back inside the dorms as if several threats weren’t just made on his life. Yet with his childish energy gone, Kaede suddenly feels the weight of the tension hanging between her and Maki. “So,” she decides to say. “Maki… you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you’re trying to make small talk, just stop,” Maki says. “If you want to pretend either of us has any interest in being friends, you’re a worse liar than Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words produce a near knee-jerk reaction in Kaede. “Maki, at this point, I really don’t care about or want to be your friend, okay? And maybe that makes me,” she sighs, “maybe that makes me a hypocrite and… a much worse person than someone like Kaito, but we still need to be able to talk to each other, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki quirks an eyebrow. “Do we have anything to talk about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kaede says, deciding to be straightforward. “I actually need to ask you something: Kaito said you disappeared during the blackout to go check on something—so,” she straightens her shoulders to brace herself for whatever reaction is likely to come her way, “what were you checking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns away, hesitating. “That doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to be—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors to the dorms push open, and both Kaede and Maki turn to see Kaito suddenly standing between them, confused but already in the position to mediate. “Hey,” he says, looking over the situation. “You two… getting along?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was just going to bed,” Maki says. “And you should go to your room as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pulls a face. “What? Nah, I got training to do, ‘specially since I’ve been slacking off lately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Absolutely not,” Maki says. “I forbid—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not my mom, Harumaki,” he says, grinning teasingly at her. “‘Sides, I got something I need to talk to Kaede about anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words peak Kaede’s curiosity. “You do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki barely seems to hear her. “And you can’t say whatever it is when I’m around?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “I mean, I could, but it’s based on something we were talking about earlier, and I’d have to fill you in and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sounds almost as childish as Kokichi usually does when she says, “So?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can have a private conversation with Kaito,” Kaede says. “Just because you like him doesn’t mean you have to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face burns red. “I don’t—I—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She fusses with her pigtails almost in a fit, and Kaito furrows his brow in confusion. “You… alright, Harumaki? Something—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you both want to be killed?” she snaps for perhaps the hundredth time that night as far as Kaede’s concerned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems more worried than anything else, “Hey, if you need to talk to me about something, you know I’ll always fucking listen and shit, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words do nothing to help, and Maki stares at him blankly for a moment before bodily shoving past both him and Kaede into the dorms, slamming the glass doors shut behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks after her. “I… what the hell just happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think you two might be on slightly different pages about a few things,” Kaede supplies vaguely. “But that aside, what did you want to talk to me about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her question brings a sobriety to his face that Kaede can recall seeing only rarely, and he jerks his chin towards the arbor. “Let’s talk away from here—don’t really want anyone else listening in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to walk ahead, and Kaede follows, barely keeping her mouth shut as suspicion rises over her. Kaito stays silent on their short trip as well, only speaking once they reach the arbor, and he takes a moment to crane his neck in all directions to see if anyone has decided to spy on them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess here’s as good as anywhere else,” he mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose,” Kaede answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito can’t help but laugh. “Hey, I know I’m acting real fucking shady right now, but it’s nothing serious, I swear. I just wanted to say I’ve been putting some thought into what you said earlier about,” he frowns, “about if you had a way to kill the mastermind and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her heart seize up in her chest. “And?” she prompts noncommittally.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” he sighs and all but collapses on to the bench beside them. “And I think I’d do it. It’s fucked up, but if it’d save everyone… well, anyone would take that shot, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mouth twists into a tight line, and even though he’s openly vindicating everything Kaede has done, she can’t help the growing sickness rising up in her throat. “But it’d still be one of us,” she says. “I mean, what if it was me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “You’re not the fucking mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How do you know?” Kaede persists. “How can you be sure that anyone—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause I’ve decided I trust you,” he answers plainly. “And when I trust someone, I fucking trust them. Simple as that.” He shrugs, moving to nonchalantly roll out his shoulders. “And if I get betrayed then it’s my own fucking fault—but that’s not gonna happen ‘cause I picked good people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s too easy. It’s far too easy, and Kaede physically cannot stop herself from challenging him. “Then who here don’t you trust?” she says. “I mean… we know one of us left is the mastermind, and if you said you’d kill them, then that has to mean you’d be okay with killing one of us, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns up at her. “You’re thinking too hard about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “I’m not. It’s a real question.” She takes a deep breath. “Would you kill one of us—someone you know and maybe thought of as a friend—if it would mean getting out of here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said I would,” he answers, voice steady. “But you’re thinking about it all wrong. You don’t have to worry about killing <i>everyone</i>, just whoever the fucking mastermind is. So first I need to figure that out before doing anything else. Also,” he looks up at her searchingly, “you know this whole thing about stopping the mastermind is about saving everyone else, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs and sits down next to him. “I know,” she looks at her knees. “I really, really know that. So,” she forces a smile as she turns to him. “Any guesses?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets a breath out through his nose as he runs a hand through his hair. “Getting right fucking into it, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs. “We can talk in theory as much as we want, but if you’re serious—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” he answers. “Well,” he pauses for a moment. “Harumaki seems pretty hung up on it being Kokichi, and there’s gotta be a reason for that, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede snorts. “I think her reason is that she hates him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaito says. “I’m not exactly a fucking fan of the guy, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods for as much as she would argue against Kokichi being the mastermind, there is little she disagrees with on her personal feelings. A half comfortable half expectant silence falls over them and after a while Kaede finally says something that has been weighing on her for far too long. “Do you think the mastermind deserves to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses for a moment, staring out at the night sky encasing them. Kaede thinks he’s not going to answer at all when he finally says, “I think we deserve to live. And if it’s us or them…” he shakes his head. “Getting caught up in all the morality stuff—we’re just trying to fucking survive, and there’s nothing to be ashamed of about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip when she follows his gaze to stare off into space. Trying to survive. Was that what she was doing when she grabbed the shot put from the warehouse? Was that what Rantaro was doing when he was wandering around the mastermind’s lair?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She reaches up to adjust Shuichi’s hat to allow her to watch Kaito from the corner of her eye without him noticing. He seems as confident as always, though there’s a seriousness hanging over that seems almost entirely new. She remembers confessing to Tenko what she had done. It had been hard, but it had seemed right. Kaede watches Kaito for a moment a longer then turns away silently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The quiet floating between them is something is more calm than uncomfortable, and since Kaito doesn’t prod her to speak, Kaede remains silent, using the moment to listen to the night around them, devoid of any life that isn’t the two of them… and, after a moment, a set of footsteps moving hesitantly towards them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns and smiles when she sees Tenko approaching warily as if afraid she’s interrupting something. Kaede waves her over. “Tenko,” she says brightly in greeting, causing Kaito to turn as well.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Chabsahira,” he grins. “Wanna come train with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns but regains her confidence enough to come sit beside Kaede with little dithering beforehand. “Kaito should not strain himself,” she says. “Also neither of you appear to be exercising.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re mostly just talking,” Kaede says. “So maybe we’re training our minds?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Sure, that sounds good. In astronaut training, studying is just as fucking important as physical conditioning shit, you know.” He leans around Kaede. “You ever study for Neo-Aikido or whatever, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bristles at his question, seeming more vibrant and alive than Kaede has seen her all day as she readies herself to launch into a lecture. “Neo-Aikido is about the spirit and the body together—neglecting one over the other would completely be against the point of—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She goes on and Kaito laughs and asks questions that Tenko answers with vigor, and Kaede smiles as she listens. For them, the night moves on in a peace Kaede hadn’t realized she’d been missing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Elsewhere, Ryoma fiddles with his cigarette outside the door to Maki’s room. The door is impassive and the night outside even more so, and he takes a breath before reaching out to press her doorbell once. He waits for a moment and idly ponders that if she refuses to answer, he could probably ring it a hundred more times to trick her into thinking he’s Kaito.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t need to, however, as the door pulls open a crack for one of Maki’s red eyes to peer down at him. Ryoma doesn’t have to say anything for her to open it further, the meaning behind his visit already likely deciphered.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still he feels the need to say, “Maki—we need to talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki regards him coolly. “About?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t play dumb,” he sighs. “You wouldn’t have opened the door if you didn’t know why I was here. Also,” he gestures vaguely at her with his cigarette. “I know you tricked Kaito, but I saw it, too, so don’t bother lying—it’ll make this whole thing easier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shifts, crossing her arms. “Fine then. I still don’t think there’s anything to talk about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really now?” Ryoma says. “You’re just going to ignore me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that a problem?” Maki asks. “It’s not like we’re friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Never thought we were,” Ryoma replies evenly even as her stubbornness wears on his patience. “Doubt anyone here would mistake you as friends with anyone other than patient zero.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A light switches in Maki’s expression and she hisses, “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shakes his head. “Really don’t know what kind of answer you’re expecting when you ask that. Also,” he looks up at her unflinching as he says, “you know he’s going to die, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “I don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said not to lie to me,” he says. “It doesn’t take an expert to figure out his days are numbered, so the only real question is if he’ll die from whatever’s making him cough up blood or if someone’ll kill him first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one is going to touch him,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then it’ll be the disease,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Maki snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Not saying it’s a bad thing. Honestly sounds like a better way to do than whatever’s coming for the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you to stop talking about him,” she says. “Surely you’re not idiotic enough to come here just to mock me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I’ll say what I actually wanted to.” Ryoma pauses and lets out a sigh, eyes focused on the cigarette he worries between his fingers. “I just wanted to tell you that if you try and kill someone… I’ll help you get away with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki blinks. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t look up from his cigarette. “Don’t think I stuttered.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s eyes flicker over him, attempting to decipher whatever part of his words she assumes he must be keeping secret. “Have you completely given up on living, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “This isn’t about me, and it’s not about that. Now,” he pockets his cigarette, “one more question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure if I’ll answer it,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fair enough,” he replies. “Just wanted to ask—you’re sure Kokichi’s the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” Maki says, weighing her words carefully. “There’s no evidence for it being anyone else. Why are you asking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He lets out a humorless laugh. “Think I’ve made myself pretty clear already. You know,” he stares up at the ceiling spotted with florescent lights as fake as the stars outside, “I’ve been wondering why I made it this far while so many others have died. Going all the way back to Rantaro,” and then he turns to the ground. “They all wanted to live—guess it just doesn’t seem fair to me. Haven’t thought I’ve had a future for a long time, but I’m starting to finally think I know what it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes. “If you’re planning to commit a murder, know that I will not return whatever bizarre favor you’re trying to offer me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t expect you to. After all,” he smirks. “You said it yourself—we’re not friends.” He turns away from her then. “Goodnight, Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t say anything back, and Ryoma hears her door click quietly shut behind him. Without the bustle from Angie’s curfews crowding everyone together at the same time, the dorms feel empty, and Ryoma thinks he could almost reach out and touch the absence in the space beside him that used to talk about nature and manners and how the world was filled with so many wonderful things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma reaches his own door and thinks maybe it’s a good thing he’s the only one left around to know the truth. Maybe it’s a good thing he wasn’t able to find a reason to live.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s morning walk to the school is a cheerful one. She makes it with Tenko, and Tsumugi hurries a few steps from the dorms to catch up with them before immediately launching into an odd rambling story about the dream she had last night. Kaede half listens and half watches Tenko, the other girl still seemingly swept up in a deeply profound sadness though not one that crushes her completely anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The conversation between them is rather meaningless but it fills the silence, and Kaede can’t help but smile as Tenko asks questions and adds comments, not to the same lively extent she had been when speaking with Kaito the night before, but something close enough to normal.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Yet Tenko still stops abruptly when they reach the stairs to the second floor, and she quickly excusing herself with an obvious lie that she’ll get breakfast later before running off without another word of explanation. The cafeteria looms. Kaede bites the inside of her cheek as Tsumugi coughs awkwardly into her hand before saying, “Um, shall we then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They make their way there a touch less assured than before, Tsumugi spending the remainder of the trip prattling on about gossip and the grandeur of potential romances between their classmates as if they weren’t in a killing game.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cuts herself off when they finally reach the cafeteria, and Kaede pushes the doors open for an explosion of sound to greet them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s the only person missing, and thus the only person who misses the sight of Kaito slamming both his hands on the table, shouting, “Alright! I’ve had enough of you all just sitting around on your asses feeling sorry for yourselves!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her, Tsumugi squeaks at the sudden burst of noise, ducking behind Kaede for protection. Kaede, meanwhile, is mostly just confused. “Kaito?” she says taking a step forward, Tsumugi scuttling to keep up. “What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good question,” Ryoma muses, eyes focused on the cigarette between his fingers rather than whatever spectacle Kaito seems intent at putting on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s going on,” Kaito says. “Is that we’re gonna fucking stop Monokuma or Monodam or whoever the fuck thinks they’re the boss of us from just doing whatever they want! I say,” he slams his fists together, “that we stop moping around and fight back!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“While I am all for standing unified against Monokuma and despair,” Kiibo says. “I do not believe physically fighting back would accomplish much.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hush, Kiiboy,” Kokichi says, eagerly sitting forward. “I wanna see where Kaito’s going with this.” His grin widens as he practically bounces in his chair, and his eyes practically sparkle as he says, “it’s probably somewhere really dumb!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns. “If you believe that is the case than why would you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I say,” Kaito says, voice rising over them. “That our first step is we need to do something about the fucking Exisals, and once those are out of the way,” he pumps a fist, “all we gotta do is break down the bars on the cage!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “And how the fuck would we do any of that shit, space case?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only half a surprise that Maki’s the one to speak up in support. “The Exisals were disabled before as was Monokuma during the blackout. If one of those not insistent on withholding vital information would decide to share how Himiko did such a thing, we might actually be able to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But,” Tsumugi stutters from behind Kaede, “Himiko w-was…” she swallows, nervously shaking her head, “Himiko was killed for doing that, wasn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The real problem,” Ryoma says, still not looking up. “Is escaping in the first place…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Why is that a problem?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He goes silent, and Miu says, “H-Hey, weren’t you one of the people who was all about escaping when Sunday school started spewing shit a-about starting a fucking cuck cult and all of us staying here forever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very gently Kiibo says, “Miu, you also joined Angie’s student council.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma mercifully ignores Kiibo’s comment, instead just shrugging. “Guess I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares hard at him. “Ryoma makes a reasonable point—we can’t know what the outside world is like if we were to leave here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well we have an idea at least,” Kaede says. “But even if we didn’t or it’s something awful, anything has to be better than staying here—anything’s better than being trapped in this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly!” Kaito says. “Which is why we need to actually start fucking doing something about it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Kokichi springing up out of his chair. “A bunch of people recklessly charging the Exisals would be pretty exciting,” he taps a finger to his chin, “then pretty boring since the game would go on with less players…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “I’m not gonna try and fight a giant robot with my fists, idiot. I’m sayin’ Miu or Kiibo should build something to take ‘em down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo shakes his head. “Despite being a robot, myself, I am not very knowledgeable about electronics, nor do I wish to be, and it is robophobic of you to presume that I would be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what about you, Miu,” Kaede says. “Could you make anything to help us escape? Like maybe a bomb to blow up some of the bars on the cage or anything that could, uh,” she chooses her words carefully, “disable one of the Exisals or get it to fire at the cage?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi adds, “Maybe a super cool invention to help us get through Kaede’s completely hopeless tunnels?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu wilts at the stares turned on her. “I-I would—a-and totally can!—make shit like that, but,” she flips her hair over her shoulder. “A genius inventor like me has priorities and crap, and I got somethin’ else I’m working on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And this something else is more important than our escape?” Maki asks. “Or perhaps do you want us to remain trapped here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The accusation causes Miu to suddenly seize up, physically trembling. “I-I-I—what the fuck are you saying!? I’m not—I’m—Bakamatsu, tell her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sudden shout for help catches Kaede off guard. “W-What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course you’d ask her,” Maki says. “One of the only people more suspicious than you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh wow!” says Kokichi delightedly. “I wonder who Maki will blindly accuse next? I sure hope it’s me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares at him. “It is you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Man, predicting Maki is just too easy! I’m starting to think she’ll never do anything interesting. Let’s see,” he taps a finger to his chin. “What could Maki do that would be not boring?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kaito snaps. “Leave her alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She could tell a really big lie,” Kokichi says, ignoring him. “I mean, she was already trying to do that until Kaede tattled on her about being an assassin, but maybe she could tell an even bigger and better lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Tsumugi says. “What are you talking about? Do you know something about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He doesn’t know anything about anything,” Maki says. “He’s just an idiot trying to act smarter than he is, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s not wrong though,” Ryoma says, words casting a silence over the room as all stares turn to him. “A lot of us are probably lying about one thing or another… that’s just the way Monokuma built his game.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma?” Tsumugi says nervously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squares her shoulders. “He’s right—this game is built on paranoia and us being unable to trust each other, and,” she lets out a deep breath, “pretending we all know what everyone else is thinking or planning to do is… arrogant, I suppose, and it’s why we keep being blindsided whenever there’s a killing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “Assuming to know another person’s values or world view is an easy way to get yourself killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re agreeing with Ryoma and Kaede now? Even though their whole point is that you’re a big fat liar?” Kokichi laughs. “Hey, Maki, do you ever think for yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito barks. “I thought I told you to leave her the fuck alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi clicks his tongue. “Kaito, even if she just says dumb things like ‘oh I’m gonna kill you because I’m an assassin in case you forgot,’ Maki can still at least <i>speak</i> for herself,” his grins darkens. “Can’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares at him darkly, “Even though it doesn’t help us escape this game—which it will—I am going to kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks between them, brow furrowed and internally weighing something Kaede can only guess at. He opens his mouth, but Ryoma, of all people, manages to beat him to it. “And then there will be one less of us in the world…” he sighs and pockets his cigarette, finally looking up, but only at Maki. “Wouldn’t that be something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her posture shifts. Kaito seems even more concerned that he did a moment ago, and moves to take back the conversation. “No one’s going to kill anyone,” he says frowning, and it worries Kaede that he feels the need to repeat that, again saying, “no one’s… no one’s killing anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo doesn’t seem to share Kaede’s feelings saying, “Correct. As long as Maki keeps guard over the motive, no one will have reason to attempt murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what if Maki kills someone?” Kokichi asks. He begins rubbing at his suddenly watery eyes. “She always says she will, and she’ll probably go after me or Kaede…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “You’ve said that before, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she’s not going to hurt anyone,” Kaito finishes. “And we’re not having this <i>fucking</i> meeting to <i>fucking</i> argue with each other. We’re here to work together for once in our goddamn lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, oh, oh!” Miu shouts, suddenly jumping to her feet, chair clattering behind her. “Listen, I asked Bakamatsu to do this for me later, but,” she straightens and jerks a thumb towards herself. “I-I’ll have you all know the great, genius, girl inventor, Miu Iruma, has started makin’ something that’ll get us all out of here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others all turn to her. Tsumugi gasps, “You are?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “The fuck didn’t you say anything earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quirks an eyebrow. “Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-W-Well,” Miu stutters before descending into mumbling.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With Miu suddenly shrinking over the attention being directed her way, Kiibo says, “Yesterday, Miu spent quite a bit of time preparing something in the computer room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His comment spurs Miu to action. “R-Right! A-And it’s gonna be ready really fucking soon!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that right…” Ryoma says, regarding her warily.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede asks, “Whatever you’re making will help us escape?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You fucking bet your blow-up tits it is,” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “Does that mean… we figured out how to end the killing game then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “If Miu’s telling the truth, I see nothing else to talk about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kokichi. “But what if Miu’s the one telling a really big lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And why would she fucking do that?” Kaito asks, rolling his eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just keeps smiling. “I don’t know—maybe Miu wants to keep the game interesting, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kiibo says sharply, rising from his place at the table as well. “If you are implying Miu would—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kiiboy, maybe you already forgot because you’re just a robot,” Kokichi says. “But Kaede already said it’s pretty arrogant to assume you know what other people are thinking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stands his ground. “Maybe that is true, but I know Miu, and I know she is a good person who would never harm one of her friends like you seem to be suggesting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu stares at him with wide eyes. “K-Kiibo…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares at him with blank eyes. “Hmm.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got nothing to fucking say for yourself now,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stays silent a moment longer before folding his hands behind his head and smiling. “I think I’m done. I just hope you all find the truth you’ve been looking for, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches him carefully as he moves past her towards the door. “What is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He places a finger to his lips as he pushes the door to the cafeteria open with his shoulder. “Just that a few balls are going to drop soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw as he disappears, all too aware of the meaning behind his taunt, even with the others exchanging confused looks behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Breakfast continues on in relative peace despite the tensions still clearly hanging in the air. Ryoma excuses himself after a few minutes, as does Miu—boasting about how she needs to keep working on her new project—with Kiibo following after, carrying his own ramblings about how sure he is Miu’s new project will bring them all hope.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When the two leave as a pair, Tsumugi sighs dreamily. “They’re so cute together, and here I was thinking romance was dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “What’s more romantic than someone who can’t fucking talk without spitting and a robot?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, Kiibo would probably be very upset if he heard you say that,” Tsumugi chides. “Also do you really not believe in romance?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede had already been watching Maki out of the corner of her eye and notices her seem to perk up slightly at the question. She has to poorly disguise her urge to laugh in shock with a cough, though Maki seems too focused on whatever Kaito’s response will be to pay her much attention.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just snorts, clearly oblivious to the weight of his answer. “I believe in us getting the fuck out of here—wait,” he screws up his face. “Is this the shit you said Tsumugi was talking about yesterday, Kaede? Like love triangles and all of that crap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Kaede says, distinctly aware of Maki’s violent gaze.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” Tsumugi scolds, coming to her rescue. “Why did you tell him?! Ugh,” she presses her hands to her face. “I’m so embarrassed now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito starts laughing, and Kaede smiles along, happy enough that the conversation seems to be over.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Maki says, “But… do you think it’s possible given our current situation?” she frowns at the table.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What possible?” Kaito asks. “Getting a crush? I mean, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps glaring at the table. Then she lists, “Kaede liked Shuichi, and Tenko liked Himiko, and Ryoma liked Gonta… and half of those people are dead. So,” she shakes her head. “Never mind, this is stupid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stands, the lighthearted atmosphere evaporating completely. She walks to the door without a word, leaving the other three to stare after her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “A-Ah, I guess this is my fault since I brought it up. Sorry,” she looks down. “I wasn’t really thinking…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” Kaito says waving his hand as he gets up from the table as well. “I’m gonna talk to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow at him. “Do you know why she’s upset?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “But I’m sure I’ll figure it out. See you later, Kaede, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wave him goodbye, and Tsumugi says, “Not to start gossiping again, but I feel like things are going to get worse between those two before they get better.” She shakes her head, letting out a sigh. “I guess I’ll just have to pin all my hopes on Kiibo and Miu now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a half smile. They continue making small talk, and some part of the back of Kaede’s mind absently observes that Tsumugi seems to talk a lot but say very little. She’s spoken to the girl so many times and still can say so few things about her or any of their conversations.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But some people are just private, and Tsumugi’s probably just scared, and Kaede chats idly with her about nothing over breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In a different part of the school, Ryoma mindlessly walks a few laps around the dorms and other buildings, knowing he should probably just return to his room but finding himself feeling almost rebellious against the idea of doing so.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Instead he absently looks for bugs and wanders the gardens. It’s only when he reaches the stairs down to the labs on the outskirts of the school that a thought occurs to him. He takes the extra apple he had grabbed during breakfast out of his pocket and makes the walk to the finely crafted dojo before he can let himself over think and back out of his choice.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma realizes he also doesn’t even know if Tenko’s there, but he hears the sounds of a training dummy being smacked around reverberating throughout the room when he pushes the front doors open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t notice him immediately, and Ryoma debates the best way to go about signaling his presence without getting smacked by a highly trained martial artist.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">So from his spot near the front doors, he says, “Tenko, brought you something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko whirls around to face him, eyes wide and body positioned to pounce on her intruder. In surrender, Ryoma reaches out his hand baring the apple towards her, and Tenko relaxes almost all at once. Her voice is still tight, however, when she says, “Tenko does not appreciate awful boys sneaking up on her, but,” she glances down at the apple. “Thank you, Ryoma. If you put it down, Tenko will try and eat in a minute.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs but does as instructed. “You eat anything yesterday?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stiffens at his question. “Kaede brought Tenko an apple for breakfast… and Tenko tried to make some toast later…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” he says. “In two days you’ll have had two apples and some bread.” He looks at the ground. “Not your parent and can’t say I know you that well so, I’m not gonna bother you about it,” he tugs at his hat. “And I’m not about to make you go to the cafeteria either, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you for your concern, Ryoma,” Tenko says. “But Tenko will take care of herself.” She turns back to stare at the training dummy, wiping a bit of sweat from the side of her face. “Tenko has Neo-Aikido, and Neo-Aikido is all about maintaining both the spirit and the body… and Tenko will use it to help,” she stutters for a moment, “h-help guide her through this, a-and whatever else happens next.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “I see. Nice you have something like that… but what if what comes next is,” he frowns. “Harder—what if things only get worse?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko keeps looking at her training dummy. “Tenko does not want to believe that will happen, but,” she shakes her head and turns back to him. “Tenko also knows that sometimes really bad things happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like being trapped in a killing game?” Ryoma suggests.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smiles wryly. “Tenko doesn’t know why she’s here or why this had to happen,” she says. “She doesn’t know why good people get hurt or hurt other good people,” she moves a hand to wipe at her quickly watering eyes, “she doesn’t know why Himiko… she doesn’t know,” with both hands presses to her face, she mumbles, “she doesn’t know why her training isn’t working…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma has no idea what to say, and he turns his face away to give Tenko some privacy as she tries to collect herself again. The room feels hollow and crowded all at once with only the sounds of Tenko’s soft sniffling echoing through it. Ryoma tells himself too much time has probably passed for his words to mean anything to her, but he says, “grief never makes sense—it’s just not what it does. Least that’s how I’ve thought about it… sorry—that probably doesn’t help much…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, still rubbing at her eyes. Ryoma closes his eyes for a moment and tries to think of something to say. Then, “maybe you don’t really care what I think, Tenko,” he says, “but you seem like a strong person… think—I think you can probably handle whatever’s coming next even if it’ll be even harder than this,” and he doesn’t say, <i>you’re not a coward like me.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods again and finishes brushing a few stray tears from her eyes. “Th-Thank you, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t mention it,” he says, turning to leave.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” she calls after him. “Would you like to train with Tenko? Not sparring, but perhaps just poses?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a deep breath and stares at the exit looming before him. Then he turns, saying, “sure. Can’t promise I’ll be any good at any of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles at him as he takes his shoes off to step on to the mat, and Ryoma thinks, <i>might as well do something before the end of the world.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And the day passes uneventfully, filled with half finished conversations and words unsaid, and Kaede only feels like she isn’t in a dream when Miu’s hammering on her door the next morning physically startles her awake.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still groggy from sleep, Kaede pushes her door open to find Miu practically vibrating on the other side. Before Kaede can say anything or even fully take in the sight in front of her, Miu says, “it’s ready! Bakamatsu—everything’s fucking ready!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her. “Miu,” she says glancing over the other girl to take in the bags under her eyes and smell of coffee coming off her in waves. “Did you sleep at all last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sleep’s a fucking waste of time,” Miu says with a wave of her hand. “That’s why my inventions are for—” she cuts herself off with a shake of her head. “Actually, who gives a shit about that? Point is Miu Iruma’s genius, amazing, super invention to get us all the hell out of here is a go!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede’s attention. “You mean we can get out of here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“From a certain point of view!” Miu says with entirely too much confidence. “Now go fucking wake up the others! This is an all or nothing kind of orgy!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to interpret that statement, but watches as Miu runs to Tsumugi’s door only a few feet away to begin banging her fist on it rather than ringing the doorbell. She sighs, but puts on a smile as the thoughts of actually escaping and actually saving everyone begin to flitter through her mind. She walks across the way to politely ring Ryoma’s doorbell, and it’s only a matter of minutes before everyone is tired but together, following Miu in a loose parade up to the computer room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside, Kaede sees nine chairs clearly taken from other parts of the school assembled in the room with five on one side of the strange giant box looming over them and four on the other. More curiously, each has an odd visor looking thing on it, and Kaede has to watch her step to not trip over the tangles of wires crisscrossing this way and that across the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Standing before them, Miu flings an arm out to the side. “Ta-da! Motherfucking virtual reality!” she announces. “With a switch and a press and my genius, every last one of you virgins is free from this hell hole of a school!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The silence that falls over the room is palpable. Kaede is the first to break it, saying, “So… this isn’t a way to help us escape?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I said from a certain point of view it was!” Miu shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room then practically explodes with sound as Kaito starts yelling about Miu lying, and Kiibo jumps to her defense with the caveat that she should have been clearer, while Kokichi starts giggling about everything really being a game, among the rushes of voices swimming past Kaede’s ears.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Over the sea of yelling, Miu finally screams, “And I already got the fucking okay from the bears, and they said they’d put cool shit in it, too, so you can go stick a cactus up your diseased ass if you don’t want to come!” and it’s enough to catch Kaede’s attentions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You what?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite being quieter than most of the current shouting matches going on, her question draws enough attention to bring the room back to a reasonable state of peace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squirms under the sudden attention, but says, “Y-Yeah. I-I asked the bears a-and the robot one thought it would be a good place to put more clues and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, clues?” Tsumugi asks. “Clues about the outside world? O-Or about our memories?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh-huh,” Miu nods. “H-Here, I’ll call ‘em right now.” She cuffs a hand over her mouth before yelling, “H-Hey you furry fucks! Need your help with something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s an awkward few seconds of silence before the three remaining Monokubs suddenly appear from seemingly nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam looks at Miu blankly—who jerks her chin to direct him towards the others—before making a waddling turn to stare at the others. He raises one round paw. “I-THOUGHT-IT-OVER, AND-WORKING-TOGETHER-TO-FIND-CLUES-IN-A-NEW-PLACE-WILL-HELP-EVERYONE-TO-WORK-TOGETHER-AND-GET-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See!” Miu says. “I told you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quiet fills the room again, and Maki is the first to say, “This is obviously a trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can only sigh as yelling starts up all around her anew.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And I'm back! Reading through chapter 4 transcripts made me realize the pre-VR sequences are a bit odd in pacing, since not too much happens during the day but the night scenes are important, so I ended up switching things around a little bit.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday! You guys are too sweet!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s more yelling to be had.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the midst of the shouting and flailing limbs, Kaede sees Monodam standing in the center, beeping anxiously in an attempt to regain some kind of order.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“EVERYONE,” he says, his voice stilted as ever even in his obvious distress. “EVERYONE, PLEASE-GET-ALONG. THIS-IS-ALL-FOR-THE-SAKE-OF-ENSURING-EVERYONE-GETS-ALONG—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How is the fact that Monokuma,” Maki snipes, “supporting this alone isn’t enough to convince you all this is a death trap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu flails. “He just really wants us to fucking get along, okay!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monodam dully responds he is not Monokuma, but in the edge of her hearing, Kaede catches Monotaro saying, “Monophanie, psst, Monophanie—we gotta do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The pink one turns to him, mumbling back, “about what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He jerks his round head towards Monodam. “About powertrip—I’m telling you, without Dad around, one of us is next.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Monophanie says. “Dad didn’t protect Monokid or Monosuke—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What we need to do,” he says. “Is find a new dad!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monophanie just blinks. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice arcs over the room, then, as he says, “the fact that Miu’s world has clues that can provide hope for our situation in it should encourage us to go—not make us hesitate.” He places a metal hand over his chest. “I believe in Miu’s good intentions, and I believe she did this at her own personal expense for our benefit.” He pauses, closing his eyes briefly before saying, “I have asked my inner voice, and it says that exploring the virtual world is our best course of action. Maybe it will lead to our escape, or to new clues, or even just provide relief from our current situation—all of which will be beneficial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A silence follows his almost inspirational words as they soak over the room. Kaede notices Monotaro’s eyes sparking, as he says, “Daddy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His earlier assuredness shatters, and Kiibo sputters in indignation while the tiny robot bear rushes to his side, clinging to his leg.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu seizes the opportunity. “K-Kiibs’s right!” she shouts. “So what if the virtual world was first made by Monokuma or some fucking asshole!? It’s full of clues and crap, <i>and</i> I’ve edited the absolute shit out of it, so it’s not dangerous!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede’s attentions. “Wait, you edited it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Miu responds. “Took out any crap that could be used as a weapon, or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi interrupts. “Um, does that mean that if we’re all in the virtual world, no one can be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu tosses her hair over her shoulder. “The fuck do you think I built this for, limp tits? Long as we’re in Miu-topia, we’re out of the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what you meant by escape…” Ryoma mumbles to himself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “What about everyone’s bodies?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves a hand. “I dunno. They’ll be here, but we’ll all be in the virtual world, where shit’s on tighter lock down than the stick up Harumukwa’s ass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares. “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu flounders, scrambling to hide behind Kiibo, still in the process of attempting to shake Monotaro off his leg. “I-I just mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaito says. “Your mind and body and shit are separate? And you have like an avatar or something kind of like in a video game instead?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “But what happens if something happens to your virtual body? Will it hurt or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing should happen in the godforsaken first place,” Miu insists. “Like I said—I fucking stayed up all goddamn night taking dangerous shit out. The only way you could kill someone was if you got real creative, and we all know none of you virgins have any imagination, so it’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But it’s still possible?” Tsumugi asks. “Someone could be killed inside—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And someone could also be killed outside if we stay here,” Maki says. “Our situation doesn’t change.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “I get it. Guess the real question then is if everyone wants to try and find whatever bait Monokuma put in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence falls over them again, punctuated only with Miu’s boots clomping against the metal floor as she squirms nervously on he spot. Finally, Kaito says, “Fuck it. Let’s do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him. “Really?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “I’m still mad Miu fucking lied, but it’s like Harumaki said. Maybe it’s dangerous in there but it’s also dangerous out here. We've got nothing to lose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stiffens, but says, “That… is true.” She turns her face away. “We won’t get any closer to actually ending this game if we refuse to take risks…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is correct,” Kiibo says, monetarily looking up from his struggle with Monotaro. “Escaping together should always be our number one priority.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For the first time since the yelling subsided, Kokichi speaks up. “That’s not what she said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him. “What do you mean? Maki said—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That we should end the game,” he places a finger against his lips. “Kiiboy said we should all try and hold hands and escape together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Aren’t those the same thing? Or don’t they go together at least?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles as he shrugs. “Sometimes they do, and sometimes they don’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know why you seem insistent on twisting my words,” Maki says. “But ensuring the end of this game is still my number one priority.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It should be everyone’s priority,” Ryoma says dully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that means we need to work together to do whatever it takes!” Kaito says, picking up his line of reasoning with far more enthusiasm. “And if that means going in Miu’s shitty computer world, I say we do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smile at his words. “I think we should go, too—especially since Miu said it’s at least marginally safer than just staying here, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah!” Miu says. “Shit’s fucking safer than Kiibs’s virgini—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And there’s a chance will be able to find out more about our missing memories, right?” Tsumugi adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“IF-YOU-ALL-WORK-TOGETHER,” Monodam adds, “YOU-CAN-DISCOVER-MORE-ABOUT-THE-OUTSIDE-WORLD-AND-BECOME-EVEN-BETTER-FRIENDS. SOMETIMES-IT-IS-STILL-NECESSARY-TO-PUNISH-YOUR-FRIENDS-IN-ORDER-TO-GET-ALONG-BUT—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monotaro squeaks, clinging again to Kiibo’s legs. “Dad! Protect me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I am not your father!” Kiibo shouts almost desperately.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I dunno,” Kokichi answers. “A tiny robot being attracted to a big robot—seems pretty suspicious to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There won’t be any Mono-whatevers to bother us in your program world either, right, Miu?” Ryoma asks, coolly observing the situation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it, powerbottom,” Miu answers. “Only the nine of us our invited to this orgy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “Are we all agreed then? We’re all going in together?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips over to a chair, “Ooh! This is so exciting! Hey, hey!” he pats the chair next to him. “Kaito! Come sit next to me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I thought you didn’t like him after—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just want to be virtual world buddies with someone big and strong who can protect me,” Kokichi says, swinging his legs. “And out of everyone here, Kaito would be your number one pick for a meat shield, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just glares, his mouth forming into a tight line. Maki says, “No one here would want to pro—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” Kaito says, much to Maki and Kaede’s bewilderment. He walks over, stares down at Kokichi grinning up at him for a moment before settling in the chair next to him. “Miu,” he says. “Wanna hurry up and tell us what the fuck we’re actually doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She springs into action. “Right! Alright, all of you sit the fuck down and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko’s not going,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips her head to face her. “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fuck do you mean you’re not going!?” Miu screeches. “Didn’t you just hear all the crap Kiibs and everyone said about escaping or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko did, and she understands, but,” she says. “Maybe everyone said they want to work together to escape, and Tenko doesn’t want to doubt her friends, but she can’t believe that everyone’s telling the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a sidelong look. “This is about what happened to Himiko, isn’t it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Her killer is someone in this room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You killed her,” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I wasn’t talking to you, Maki,” he just smiles. “Hey, Tenko, who do you think did it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop it,” Kaede says, moving to stand in front of Tenko protectively. “And how dare you mock her—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “It’s fine. Tenko…” she lets out a sigh. “Tenko has been thinking a lot about it. Tenko still believes in her friends but… she also know someone has to be hiding something. It’s the only thing that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s like what Kaede said the other day,” Ryoma says softly. “Thinking you know what’s going on in everyone else’s heads is just arrogant. We’ve all been saying how much we want to work together since day one, but, well,” he shrugs. “There were sixteen of us then, and now there’s not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her stomach twist. Every word out of Tenko and Ryoma’s mouths is a near reflection of the thoughts that had been plaguing her ever since the beginning of the killing game and her search for the mastermind. Her search that had gotten far too many people killed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito breaks the silence, because Kaede’s come to realize that’s what he does. “So what’s the plan then?” He looks to Tenko, his voice is genuinely questioning rather than accusatory. “You think Miu’s virtual world is full of crap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squawks as Tenko starts speaking over her. “Tenko… still thinks it might be a good idea for some of us to go, but,” her mouth twists into a frown. “Tenko would prefer to stay here and watch over everyone’s bodies. There’s just too high a chance that someone will try and do something when everyone’s distracted, like with what happened with… the blackout.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re trustworthy enough to leave alone?” Maki asks, voice cold. “For all we know, you could be planning to kill—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She isn’t,” Kaede says firmly. “Tenko would never kill someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if she did,” Kokichi chimes in. “We would totally know it was her, and that would be sooooo boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“S-So what?” Miu stutters. “You’re just gonna sit here, a-and stare at our helpless bodies?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s face almost involuntarily twists into an expression of disgust at her words while Kiibo says, “I do have to agree that having a lookout to watch over this place while we are not aware of our surroundings is a logical idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Tenko will guard us?” Tsumugi asks, pressing her hands to her heart. “If have to admit, that does make me feel a little safer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks up at Tenko. “You should probably still figure out how to get into Miu’s program world, though, in case something does happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Right. Tenko will do her very best to make sure nothing happens, but she will come get everyone if something does… go wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The implications of her words make Kaede wince but she says, “Here,” and walks over to the two remaining empty chairs next to Kaito. “You can watch me try and setup getting in when Miu tells us what to do. That way you can know what to do later, even though nothing bad is going to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods again. “Right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My, my,” Kokichi says. “It seems like everyone really trusts Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course we do,” Kaito says with a snort as Tenko takes her seat next to Kaede, watching intently as the other girl picks up the odd headset before her to inspect it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu fidgets. “This… you—you don’t wanna come with us for even a little bit?” she squeaks. “You don’t wanna come find whatever awesome clues or, uh,” she glances to Monodam standing at her feet, “become friends and shit with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Kaede frowns. “I can tell Tenko about anything we find when we're finished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is sorry for not helping with the search, if that’s what you are concerned about, Miu,” she says. “But she really thinks it is safer for everyone if Tenko stays here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Kokichi says, bouncing in his chair. “Though it’d be really cool if someone tried to fight Tenko and she had to battle them in an epic duel!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is nothing cool about someone attempting to commit murder,” Kiibo says sternly as he moves to one of the empty chairs, nearly tripping over the Monokubs at his feet in the process.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Monotaro says, pointing a paw at Monodam. “You hear that? New Dad says no killing your siblings!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sheer exasperation on Kiibo’s face as he settles into a chair is almost amusing enough to distract from Maki saying, “it would be difficult for someone to fight off Tenko, especially in such an enclosed space.” She frowns as she walks to the chair next to Kiibo. “Fine. I suppose this is the best we can hope for to put an end to this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess it is,” Ryoma says, moving to sit beside her, and Kaede does not miss the odd, meaningful look he gives Maki that she refuses to glance back at.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems to also recognize the tense atmosphere, though she says little other than, “Um, it sure, uh, sure seems that way,” as she takes a hesitant seat next to Ryoma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu remains the only one still standing. Everyone’s gazes move to her for further instructions, and she starts sweating on the spot. Her eyes dart around at the others, oddly lingering over Tenko, before she gives almost a full body sigh and stomps over to the last chair. She collapses into and picks up the odd headset before her, lazily waving it around with one hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, look, it’s not that fucking hard,” she says, voice one of frustration. “There are two wires that’ll hook up your brain into the virtual world. Red goes in the right socket, blue in the left, and if you fuck up,” she gestures vaguely, “I dunno. Something fucky will probably happen—like memory loss or some shit, maybe switching your consciousness with someone else’s, which,” she presses a hand to her chin, “actually that could be kinda cool.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let’s all do our best to ensure we do it correctly then,” Kiibo says quickly, being extra deliberate about the placement of the cords on his visor. “Miu,” he calls, turning it to her. “Is this right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She leans over to give him a thumbs up. “Yup. Everyone try to be less of a dumbass than normal and do what Kiibs did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up to double check that the position of the wires on her headset matches Kiibo’s. Tenko hovers behind her, probably taking too much effort to commit the relatively simple instructions to memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Next,” Miu says. “Put that visor over your ugly mug and flip the switch on your forehead, then bam! Virtual world!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s all there is to it?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Listen, I made this shit as simple as possible ‘cause I know one of you idiots would figure out a way to screw it up if I didn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at her words, but says, “Tenko believes she should be able to do all that by herself if need be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay,” says Kokichi, bouncing impatiently. “Enough waiting around already! I wanna see what my avatar looks like. I hope it’s really awesome and looks like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It looks like your fugly twink ass,” Miu says. “I designed all the avatars to look like you guys, except, you know,” she tosses her hair over her shoulder, “better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw,” Kokichi pouts, placing his visor over his head. “I wanted to be a horse…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito mumbles, “the fuck is wrong with you?” as he moves to do the same.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives the two of them a half smile, as she sees something akin to the familiar banter between them returning. She glances across the way to see Tsumugi and Kiibo put their visors over their heads as well, before turning back to give Tenko an encouraging smile.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles back, the reason why she’s staying behind looming over both of them. She reaches forward to squeeze Kaede’s hand one last time before Kaede puts the visor over her eyes and flicks the switch.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The experience is almost like that of the Flashback Light as strings of code seem to suddenly flash directly into Kaede’s brain, swimming into her very mind before giving way to a brief blackness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then there’s a flash of light, and she’s standing in a rather old looking room, decorated with plain looking rugs, portraits, furniture and a glittering telephone. More curiously, she notices tiny, rounded versions of Kaito and Kokichi behind her, as well as quick flashes of light that give way to similar versions of Tsumugi and Kiibo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at them. “You guys are all so cute,” she says without even thinking.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me and Kaito are always cute,” Kokichi grins back. “Except when Kaito’s being really gross.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, if I punch you does it hurt in real life?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi says, jerking to look down at her own body. “Oh, what? These graphics don’t look anything like what Miu said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… am still a robot,” Kiibo says, sadly, looking at his tiny hands. “That is a bit disappointing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances down at herself, noting her similarly rendered body. Kaito laughs, “Careful, Kaede, you might have trouble if your hat falls off. It’s fucking huge.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks at him before reaching up as best she can with her oddly proportioned limbs to feel the bill of her hat sticking out over her head. “Oh,” then she notices that the familiar texture of the slightly worn hat registers on her tiny rounded fingers, and she says, “huh, I can actually really feel it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like, um,” she frowns, trying to think how to phrase it. She brushes her fingers across the sleeve of her shirt to demonstrate. “Like, I can feel the textures and stuff of my clothes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words suddenly seem to register with the others, who all promptly begin feeling along their sleeves or the front of their shirts to confirm for themselves, with the notable exception of Kokichi, who opts to grab the sleeve still loosely hanging off Kaito’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” he says. “Just like I remember in the real world.” He smiles as he lets go, twirling on his toes in a circle. “Man! This place is the absolute coolest!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says, watching him hesitantly. “I guess this means we’re able to feel things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Perhaps we should wait for Miu’s confirmation,” Kiibo says. “But it would seem we have all five senses.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So I could punch Kokichi,” Kaito muses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Two bright flashes of light suddenly appear and fade away to reveal Maki and an even smaller than normal Ryoma. They both turn to look around, inspecting the room and their avatars. Maki mutters, “this is stupid…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma tilts his head up to examine some of the paintings on the wall, and Kaede swears she sees the now very large ears on his hat twitch like cat ears. Her first thought is that he now looks absolutely adorable, but she bites her tongue, also knowing how little he would probably appreciate that sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Ryoma says. “This feels strange. Odd thinking how this is connected to our bodies back in the real world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” Kaito says. “Guess we don’t really have to worry about anything happening to our bodies in here, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right, that’s right!” Kokichi says delightedly. “And that means Kaito can’t cough up blood and be totally gross in here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at him, though Kaede still can’t help but find the expression cute due to the avatar’s simplified graphics. For a moment, she internally worries about being able to take anything seriously with everyone looking the way they do when one more flash of light bursts into existence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It phases out as fast as it came, and Miu appears, looking around happily at the room before them before stretching her arms over her head. “Ah, I fucking love this place—feels great every time I come here.” She turns to the others. “Well? Ain’t it fucking amazing? Feel like getting down on your knees and thanking me yet—‘cause you should.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Tsumugi says. “I think you lied to us about our avatars. These don’t really look anything like us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves a hand. “Yeah, I know. They’d be ugly as fuck if I tried making ‘em realistic.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kaede says. “Miu, there’s something I wanted to ask about our avatars. We noticed that we could feel things, so do we have all five senses in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bet your whale tits you do,” Miu answers. “If you feel something in here, your brain’ll send a signal to your body so you get pain, pleasure, and all that good shit in between.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaito says. “If I punched Kokichi, he wouldn’t feel it but his brain would?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs. “I mean, yeah, basically. Also that reminds me, shit doesn’t break in here. Everything you see—including your avatars—isn’t programmed to break. Like if you decided to be a piece of shit and rip a leg off a table, you wouldn’t get very far. Make sense?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That applies to our bodies as well,” Maki says. “So, for instance, if someone decided to jump from a very high place like a cliff, they’d be fine?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shakes her head. “No, it’s like what Momomoron said. Your body in here would experience the pain of falling, and your brain would probably freak the fuck out or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“By that,” Ryoma sighs. “I assume you mean die, or something akin to it, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How the fuck would I know!?” she asks, flailing her arms. “I haven’t tested it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, seems like Miu hid quite a bit from us about this world, huh?” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I didn’t hide fucking anything!” she says. “There’s just a lotta crap to explain. Th-That’s all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there more we need to know before we can begin our exploration, then?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to him. “Uh, yeah, few things. Next rule about avatars is that everyone’s physical capabilities—like your strength and speed and shit—are averaged out across everyone, so we’re all the same.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” Kokichi says. “Does that mean I race Ryoma now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re the same speed,” Tsumugi says. “So it would be a tie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we decided we want to leave,” Ryoma says pointedly. “For whatever reason—how would we go about doing that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu jerks her chin towards the sparkling phone against the wall. “If you wanna log out, go over there and say your name in the receiver. That’s the only way out, and if you log back in, you’ll appear here again.” She frowns. “I think that’s everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have one more question,” Kaede says. “You mentioned earlier that you come here a lot, so does that mean you’ve already done some exploring on your own?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh yeah,” Kaito says. “Any idea where our mystery clues are?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu huffs and moves to fish something out of her pocket, producing a small card bearing a design identical to that of their monopads. “Was gonna talk about this when I had an example to show you and shit, but since Bakamatsu’s eager, might as well do it now. Anyway, you should all have one of these somewhere on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a second to fiddle around to sling her backpack off her shoulder, and upon opening it, she immediately identifies the sole object inside as a card similar to the one Miu displayed. She takes it and turns it over in her hands, seeing that the side not decorated in Monokuma black-and-white has little but her name inscribed on it. “Are these IDs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Basically,” Miu says. “Thing is, this world was always meant to be some team building shit like tiny, green, and homicidal was talking about earlier. And that means that if you wanna access half the shit here, you need other people with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kiibo says, examining his own card. “Are there card readers or something of that nature stationed around various parts of this world then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it,” Miu says. “And all of them need a certain number of different swipes to get through.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, so a friendless loser like Miu would have trouble getting around,” Kokichi says. “I see, I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki asks, “Can’t you edit this world? Why not just get rid of them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause when I asked, the bear said he’d take the clues and shit out,” she answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess they’re just really determined for us all to work together,” Tsumugi says. “Um, also is it going to be a problem then that Tenko isn’t with us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It seems like a light suddenly clicks on in Miu’s eyes. “Ah, fuck!” she shouts, pressing her hands to her face. “Why didn’t I think of that earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we need her here then?” Ryoma prompts. “There’s actually a place that’ll only open if there’s nine people?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu seems lost in her own mumblings, so Kaede takes the opportunity to add, “There were twelve of us when the computer room first opened, so maybe there are some areas that are just locked off for good now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck,” Kaito says, attempting to a run a hand through his hair, in spite of the familiar gesture not working with his avatar. “Guess we should have come here earlier then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no,” Miu says, waving a hand. “It’s fine, most any doors need is four or something, just…” she lets out a groan. “Fuck me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is something the matter, Miu?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She groans again and begins to stomp towards the door. “It’s not fucking important. Now c’mon there’s a fucking map or some bullshit over here. Just fuck my life…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede absently thinks that such a change in temperament would likely attract more attention for anyone other than Miu as the other girl huffs again, taking out her ID. She runs it over a small, strange machine on the door frame that Kaede hadn’t noticed before. Miu says, “If you wanna leave you gotta swipe your ID or some shit. This one only needs one to get through so form a line or something, I don’t fucking care.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After saying that, she continues mumbling as she walks out of the room, the door swinging shut behind her automatically. Alone with the others in the room, all Kaede can really do is share a general shrug of confusion with everyone before walking up to the card reader herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves the card in front of it, and the machine lets out a small beep as the door swings open. “Well,” she says casually over her shoulder to the others. “Seems straightforward enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She walks through the now open door, barely catching Kokichi asking what would happen if everyone traded cards and Kaito insisting that no one would trade with him. As Kaede steps through the opening, however, for a very brief moment for entire vision goes dark and the voices she had been listening to seconds before abruptly cut off. Before she can fully process what is happening or realize that her body is immobilized, Kaede finds herself in a reasonably empty hall, the door from before closed behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She quickly spots Miu standing in front of a wall plastered with maps, and rushes over to her, “Miu, when I went through—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Loading screen,” Miu says, waving a hand dismissively. “There’re ones between each room and shit. You get used to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to protest that what just happened to her is something she would not like to get used to when she hears the door open behind her again. She briefly glances behind her to see Ryoma blinking in confusion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Loading screen!” Miu says, growing irritated. “Am I just gonna have to go down the line, telling each of you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi suddenly appears behind Ryoma, slightly bumping into him and letting out a yelp. She looks up, concealing her panic poorly as she says, “W-What just happened? For a second everything went—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins to go on a tirade, only to start it anew when Maki appears to echo her confusion and force Miu to start over.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes the opportunity to approach Kaede standing near the maps, casually saying, “the second you left, they started fighting, by the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “I think they’d do that even if I stayed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably true,” Ryoma replies before jerking his chin towards the map. “This the layout we’re looking at?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” Kaede says. “Looks like there’s a mansion with a first floor, roof, and basement? And then an outside area on this map. Miu,” she turns to interrupt Miu’s yelling. “Is this everything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Miu sighs as she stomps back over. “Whole fucking program right here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “You sound disappointed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not fucking disappointed,” she snaps. “I’m just… I’m mad at myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There a reason for that?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede would question her further, but the door opens again, this time to reveal Kokichi who happily skips towards them, seemingly undisturbed by the loading screen in the slightest. “I hope there are no more one-at-a-time doors,” he says brightly. “I don’t think Kaito could handle another one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma rolls his eyes. “Wonder why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Every door is a fucking one-at-a-time door,” Miu says. “If it’s a two person door, you and your fuck buddy both swipe your cards, then enter in the order you did it, and the program tells anyone trying to sneak in for a threesome to go fuck themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nods. “Oh, I see, I see. That’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito appears then, announcing his presence with, “What the fuck just happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s avatar’s face turns an interesting shade of red, and the last arrival—Kiibo—manages to enter at an opportune point in her yelling to catch a full explanation of the program world’s quirks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that taking far more time and cursing than Kaede really thought it needed, Miu finally throws a hand out towards the maps on the wall with far less enthusiasm than before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Before you ask,” she says. “I didn’t make these, and I haven’t personally been to most of these fucking places because of the shitty multiple people rule, so I don’t know what’s in ‘em other than what I could figure out from looking at the code.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then, um,” Tsumugi says. “Can we be sure they’re safe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “I already fucking told you, I took out all the dangerous shit! ‘Took out’ as in deleted all the codes for, so stop getting your panties in a twist, ugly betty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay,” Tsumugi says. “Geeze…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Kaede and I were looking at them earlier. Gonna assume we’re in this mansion place, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup,” Miu says. “Right now we’re in the entrance hall, and the place we spawned in was the salon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It appears there is also a kitchen, cafeteria and bathroom,” Kiibo says, examining the map. “However, would we need any of those rooms?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says. “You don’t really need any of those rooms anyway, right Kiiboy? Just because you don’t need them doesn’t mean the rest of us should have to be deprived…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Real question,” Kaito says. “Eating isn’t a thing here, right? You said items and crap can’t break, so trying to eat would be… really fucking weird or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrugs. “Those were here when I made the program. Figure they're for aesthetics or some shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So did you make anything in this world?” Kaede asks. “Or only take things out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mostly I just removed a bunch of death traps—swinging saw blades, rat poison, a giant fucking hole in the floor—crap like that,” Miu says. “There are a few Miu Iruma special touches here and there, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If there’s a giant gold statue of you somewhere in this world, I’m leaving,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“U-Uh, w-well,” Miu begins fidgeting with her hair.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses a hand to her forehead. “Did you really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Hey! New idea!” Miu says quickly. “How ‘bout we all make a rule that none of us leave here ‘til we find out the shit about the outside world or something? Sound good?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi raises his hand. “Question!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With great hesitance, Miu says, “Y-Yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How many people do we need to get into each room in here?” he asks, his question innocent enough. “Because if too many people leave, then this place will be just as useless as Miu is normally…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu scowls, and says tightly, “Basement and the church both need three, but everywhere else is two.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Even the bathroom?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, bathroom’s one,” Miu says. “But unless you avatar suddenly needs to blow chunks, I doubt anyone would ever fucking go there, you weird perverts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito walks over to the map of the outside area and presses his small hand against a picture of a building on the far side. “Is this the church thing you said earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yup, unfortunately since Chabashitra bitched out, trying to get everyone in there at once isn’t possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yeah,” Kaede says. “If there are eight of us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The card readers go both ways, correct?” Kiibo asks. “Which means you if you wanted to leave an area, you would also have to exit with the correct amount of people, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is aggressively idiotic,” Maki says. “Who would implement something like this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A homicidal robot bear obsessed with friendship,” Ryoma answers, completely deadpan. “Were you expecting a different answer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes, saying, “Miu, which parts of this world have you actually physically—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Virtually!” Kokichi interrupts</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—been to?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This place and outside,” she says. “And the bathroom, I guess. Those are the only places you can go by yourself, so if any of you virgins need some alone time—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess what would make the most sense, then,” Kaede says, “Is for us to all maybe to do a cursory walk around together, and then split up into groups to really look around in depth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Two groups of three and one group of two would be most logical based on what Miu has told us, correct?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Buddy system!” Kokichi cheers. “Okay, okay, sooo who do I want to go with?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought we agreed we’d walk around together first before splitting up?” Tsumugi asks. “And we also need an even number of people to go to the roof, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu nods. “Roof should be a good place to go first, too, so we can get a bird’s eye view of—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I’ll go by myself!” Kokichi says, already skipping away. “I wonder what I’ll find outside all alone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stands with the others, staring after him. “Should someone go with him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu waves her hand dismissively. “Probably, but there’s not much he can fuck up, so it should be fine. Means one person will have to sit out of the roof party though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll wait here,” Maki says. “It’s just to get a better view of things, right? Kaito can tell me if there’s anything remotely interesting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives her an odd look. “You sure, Harumaki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrugs. “Long as she’s not planning to go choke shota or something, it’ll be fine, and if I had to uninvite one person here from an orgy, flat chest would be top of the list.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to be killed?” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eee!” Miu yelps, scurrying over to the nearby two way staircase, waving her card over a machine on the wall next to the one going up. “Kiibo! Bakamatsu! One of you come swipe your card!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why one of us?” Kaede asks as Kiibo hesitantly walks over to do as instructed.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu sprints up the stairs as soon as Kiibo finishes without explanation. He takes a long look up the staircase after her. “Even if Miu has not been able to explore firsthand, it sure seems like she is very familiar with this world. Oh well,” he looks back down. “I suppose we can discuss this world further together later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He ascends the stairs easily enough, prompting Kaede to turn to the others. “Alright,” she says. “We probably shouldn’t keep them waiting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “I doubt it really matters since we’re all going together, but I can go next with whoever wants to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Saying that she moves to the card reader, completing the transaction with little fanfare. Kaito takes the moment to look at Maki again. “Really sure you wanna stay behind? I could hang out here instead, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” she says. “It’s really not a big deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gives her a hard stare for a moment before saying, “If you’re sure,” and walking over to join Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two of them ascend the stairs, leaving Kaede alone with Ryoma and Maki. “Guess it’s me and you then, Kaede,” he says. “Also mind if ask you something, real quick?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, sure,” Kaede says. “Go ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually not sure if I’d call it a question, just,” Ryoma shakes his head. “This whole system seems weird to me. But then again I’m not great at computers,” he waves his card over the machine, “or making friends, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to respond to that and gives him a sympathetic enough smile as she swipes her ID as well. She waits for him to go up the stairs and feels the need to say some parting words to Maki before leaving herself. “Um, have fun, I guess, Maki,” she says awkwardly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki just rolls her eyes, and Kaede lets out a sigh before walking up the stairs to join the others, not entirely sure what she was expecting out of the interaction</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The loading screen in the middle of the staircase is rather disorienting, but Kaede manages to navigate it with little trouble and soon joins the others on the roof. As soon as she does, she notices the temperature seems to plummet. The first thing she hears is Kaito excitedly shouting, “Kaede, look! Snow!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sure enough, the roof is covered in powdery white snow, which Kaito childishly kicks his feet through, beaming with delight. Kaede watches, and notes aloud, “Huh, you don’t seem to leave footprints, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” he says. “Fucking weird, right? Hey, Miu, is it ‘cause of your no breaking shit rule?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kinda?” she answers from the far side of the roof, seemingly hovering over Kiibo as he stares out a telescope. “Mostly I just think the world wasn’t really programmed to know how to handle that. The program's pretty cool, but also a shoestring piece of shit in some places.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods at her explanation, and takes a moment to join Ryoma and Tsumugi in staring off the side of the roof in a different direction. What greets her is a bit of landscape and then almost a solid wall of complete darkness. Ryoma seems to notice her surprise and says, “Miu said it’s the end of the world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi adds. “Apparently this world is only so big, and that’s the bounds of the program. It's kind of like the cage back at the school, I guess…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I see,” Kaede says. “So… we’re stuck even in here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Even in Miu’s magic escape land, we’re still trapped. How about that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi fidgets, obviously uncomfortable with the tone of their conversation. “Um, there’s also a shed over there,” she says, attempting to change the topic. “Miu checked it out and said you can go in there by yourself. I looked around, and, well,” she frowns, “there’s mostly a lot of junk and, then, uh, well maybe you should see for yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s worrying,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “I took a quick look in there and it’s mostly just stupid. Also it’s a good thing Maki chose to stay behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives them a confused look before wandering over to the shed, swiping her card. She endures the brief loading screen to see a rather plain wood looking building appear into existence around her. It’s less a shed and more a closet, Kaede notes as she takes in a variety of heavy looking winter coats draped before her, along with several cardboard boxes stuffed full of mothballs below them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The only other thing of interest is a shelf shoved up against the side of the wall, lined with golden, gleaming statues of Miu in various poses, each inscribed with a title of what Kaede assumes is some sort of achievement underneath. Idly she picks up one of the surprisingly heavy trophies and starts reading, ‘<i>best rack in all of</i>—’ before rolling her eyes and putting it back down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is aware she should likely inspect the room more, but all she can think of is how much time Miu likely put into making each of the statues before her. Her estimate alone is enough to make her shake her head in disapproval and think how lucky it was for Miu that both Maki and Kokichi opted to not stumble upon her discovery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She swipes her card again to leave the room, and back out on the roof notices that the others have gathered around Kiibo at the telescope. She walks over asking, “Find anything interesting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head as he looks up. “Yes and no. This telescope only allows one to see so far due to a second loading screen that supposedly divides this world in half.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh-huh,” Miu says. “It’s right on the other side of the river. Speaking of which, that’s our next destination since we need to head to the church.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Isn’t that one of the places where three people have to enter at a time?” Tsumugi asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And there’re will be seven of us if Kokichi decides he just wants to wander around on his own,” Ryoma says. “So someone will have to wait outside again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shakes her head. “Nah, forget all that. See, I just need to show you virgins the deal with the river, then we can all split up and go on our merry fucking way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right, that reminds me,” Kiibo says. “I briefly examined the river through the telescope, and it seems we would need some kind of second bridge to get across since the one in place appears to only reach half way to the other side.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His statement is met with little fanfare, though Miu still says, “Alright, alright, all of you calm down, no need to get excited before the good stuff starts. The great Miu Iruma has got it taken care of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, so,” Kaito says. “Can we leave now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu wilts. “Y-Yeah, I guess… you can check out my trophy room again if you want…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma starts walking away. “Someone come swipe with me so we can leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m with you, buddy,” Kaito says, following after him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“By the way, Miu,” Tsumugi says gently. “Did you really build a room to show how great you are that you couldn’t even access by yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hands in the air. “I built this entire goddamn world! leave me the fuck alone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stomps away. Tsumugi walks behind her asking, “I thought you just edited it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone with Kiibo, Kaede turns to say something along the lines of how they probably shouldn’t keep the others waiting, but stops when she sees his oddly serious face. He says, “Kaede, excuse me for asking this, but you and Miu are friends, correct? She seems to trust you quite a bit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Kaede says. “I do consider her to be someone I can trust, and she seems to like being around me… I think. It's kind of hard to tell with her sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “I see. I suppose you know her reasonably well then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is something the matter, Kiibo?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns, and for some reason Kaede can tell that his avatar doesn’t have the capabilities to fully portray his sadness. “I meant what I said earlier that I believe Miu is a good person and she would not hurt her friends. However,” he looks at the ground. “I don’t understand why she was so intent on making this world…” he shakes his head. “My apologies, perhaps I am simply over thinking things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think it’s something to consider. My guess is that Miu’s just kind of scared, but,” she shrugs. “There’s no way for us to know other than to ask her straight out, right? When we all split up, she’ll probably want to be in a group with you, so maybe that would be a good time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo smiles. “I suppose you are right. Now, we should probably hurry or Miu might imply something… uncomfortable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces. “Yeah, good point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They join the others back at the bottom of the stairs. Everyone is gathered together with the exception of Kokichi, who Maki quickly informs them she did not see during her wait alone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu leads them out of the mansion. There is a small wait enforced due to the need to go through the doors leading outside one at a time, but soon they find themselves out in the snow they had briefly witnessed on the roof. The realistic feeling of cold alone is enough to impress Kaede, but the snow draped in piles across the landscape catches her attention at just how pretty it is.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves along with the others, admiring the scenery and only stopping when they come to a bridge sticking halfway out across a rapidly moving river as Kiibo had described earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says. “Right, kids, here’s the deal—this here river is the only way to get across, so what we need is a bridge.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why don’t we just use Kiiboy?” a voice calls out, and Kokichi happily prances up to them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns at him. “Were you hiding and waiting to show up just so you could insult me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi giggles. “Maybe! Does that sound like something I would do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright, shut up,” Kaito says. “Where’d you run off to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks up at him silently, blinking his eyes. Then he reaches up a tiny hand to stage whisper, “Kaito, I can’t tell you where I went if you also want me to be quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes, saying, “it looked like he came from the forest over there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “Did you find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head, pouting. “No, it was so boring, I nearly fell asleep. But, but, but,” he scurries around the others to stand on the very edge of the bridge. “I haven’t crossed the river yet, so I hope there’s something really exciting over there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, we’re about to find out,” Miu says. “Now, let’s see, who here looks like they like being ordered around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever you’re about to say, don’t,” Ryoma says harshly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu squirms. “I-I was just thinking who I should ask to go g-get the sign we need…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sign?” Kaito echoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm, mhmm!” Kokichi says. “I saw a funny sign with English on it earlier down near where the rivers connect, but I thought it was pretty dumb so I left it alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“With no objects breaking,” Kiibo says. “If the sign is large enough, could we use that as a makeshift bridge to cross the river?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it, Kiibs!” Miu says, confidence surging through her again as she slaps him on the back. “Now which one of you lonely singles wants to go get it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one moves, and Kaede sighs, rolling her eyes. “Fine, I’ll do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds good,” Miu says. “You’ve always been a kinda take charge, top kind of person, huh Bakamatsu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just shakes her head. “I’m not even gonna respond to that. Anyway, Kokichi said it was down where this river connects with the smaller one, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s where I saw it,” Kokichi says. “Maybe it went away though. Then we’d have a magic mystery of things moving on their own.” He throws his hands in the air. “How exciting!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m going to assume that hasn’t happened,” Kaede says before turning away from them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walk is short, and the sign is easy to find due to being the only thing of interest sticking out of the snow. The English writing on it catches her attention briefly but only for a moment as she makes her way back to the group.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Nothing much seems to have transpired other than Kokichi tugging on Kiibo’s arms and torso seemingly at random, between happily spinning in circles in the snow. Meanwhile Kaito seems caught up in trying to explain to Maki why snow is something to get excited about, both seemingly aware of the other’s actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles slightly at them, though her presence is quickly called out by Miu. “Oi, that was fast, Bakamatsu! Guess it really was your first time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doing what? Going to get something?” Kaede asks as she walks over to her. “Anyway, where do you want this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu gestures to the bridge. “Just put it so it reaches both sides, that way everyone can get across no problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and does as instructed. With the sign in place, she warily presses one small foot down on it, testing it for strength in spite of Miu yelling behind her how nothing will break. It seems stable enough, and she walks across perhaps a touch too quickly. Upon reaching the other side she turns to say, “Seems safe, everyone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course it’s fucking safe,” Miu says, walking across herself with little concern. “Would I lie to you, Bakamatsu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, hmm,” Kokichi says practically skipping across. “Good question—who would Miu lie to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you really going to complain about other people telling lies?” Maki asks as she makes her own way over the bridge.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See,” he says. “I only tell nice, gentle lies—happy lies that make everything better, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito snorts, coming to stand beside him. “Spewing bullshit doesn’t make anything better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head. “Is that what you really think, Kaito? You know, I’ve also always thought that the one person you shouldn’t lie to is yourself, but,” he twirls around again, before moving to skip away, “I guess I don’t know what it’s like to be you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito barks as he starts chasing after him. “The hell is that supposed to mean!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki starts running after them without a word other than, “that idiot…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches the three of them go and can hear Kokichi’s giggling and Kaito’s shouting until both get abruptly cut off. She blinks. “What just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They hit the world dividing loading screen,” Miu says. “Sound doesn’t pass through ‘em and shit, which also means each room is soundproof. So if any of you wanna get down and dirty, now is the time to do it, especially since you don’t need protection here, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay, we get it,” Tsumugi says, signaling her presence now on the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her Ryoma says, “Probably be best to follow them, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” Kiibo says, finally joining them. “After all, once we reach the church is when we will divide to better explore, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it,” Miu says. “Then we can finally get this orgy on the road!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop talking,” Ryoma says, already walking ahead.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu retreats into her usual sniffling, as she scurries after him, mumbling about how it was just a joke. Kaede sighs and follows after, Kiibo and Tsumugi close behind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The church is a rather small building that the others appear to already be gathered around, arguing inanely among each other as Kaede arrives, still shaking her head to shrug off the disorienting effects of the loading screen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu knocks the back of her hand against a familiar card reader on the door of the church. “Alright, now that I’ve given the grand tour, this is where we part ways. The church here’s for threesomes only.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I stated earlier that based on Miu’s explanation, it would make most sense to divide into two groups of three—one to search the church, the other basement—and a group of two to search the rest of the mansion,” Kiibo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me, Kiibs, and Bakamatsu will take the church,” Miu says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede says. “Why the three of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I dunno,” Miu gestures vaguely. “‘Cause we all have hair that sticks up or something, we all don’t suck. You’re creative, figure something out yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede frowns. “I mean, I guess I’m fine with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am as well,” Kiibo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Let’s seeeee,” as he rocks back and forth on his heels. “I wanna go with… my beloved Kaito!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pouts. “But I wasn’t talking to you! I was talking to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were doing nothing other than being a pest,” Maki snaps. “I’ll go with Kaito, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says. “It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words catch almost everyone off guard, and a brief silence flickers over the groups before Kokichi claps his tiny hands together. “Great! So me and Kaito will—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to go, too,” Ryoma says. “And the three of us can check out the basement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi tilts his head at him. “Hmm? Ryoma wants to come?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaito says. “I think the two of us can handle it. Don’t worry about it, man.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kokichi says. “Is something wrong, Kaito dearest?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says quickly. “I just… wanted to check out the roof, is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki frowns, looking hard at him. “That’s what this is about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito waves his hands vaguely. “Nothing’s about anything. I just wanna go to the fucking roof, that’s all. It’s—it’s fine, okay?” He glances to Ryoma. “We’ll all just go to the basement. Forget I fucking said anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, very aware something she doesn’t understand is happening right before her eyes as Kokichi delightedly claps his hands. “Okay, the three of us will go to the basement together, and Tsumugi and Maki will explore the rest of the mansion. Oh,” he frowns. “Poor Tsumugi… being stuck alone with a murderer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, um,” Tsumugi stutters. “I-I wasn’t thinking that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki hasn’t taken her eyes off of Kaito. “We can discuss teams again when we get back to the mansion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds good to me!” Miu says. “Now, c’mon, I’ll escort you guys back to the bridge, since with your intelligence, one of you dumbasses is sure to get lost.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cackles as she stomps off, the atmosphere hanging over those following her far too tense for her laughter.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches the others disappear through the loading screen with Kiibo. She says, “I’m worried about them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am as well,” he says. “I know Miu said she ensured this program was safe, but…” he shakes his head. “I have a very bad feeling about this. My inner voice is telling me to be extra careful, as well, and the last time it acted that way… I was sabotaged by Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “I-I didn’t know that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The eyes on his avatar droop. “I never told anyone. Perhaps it is illogical, but I do not like dwelling on that incident.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I understand.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s eyes suddenly light up in recognition. “Ah, yes, my apologies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, unsure what he’s talking about. Before she can ask, Miu comes back, wiping her hands together and jittering slightly as she says. “Well, now that that’s taken care of, we can organize this bitch.” She moves past them, quickly swiping her card over the reader. “C’mon—the stupid, magic, whatever clues won’t wait forever!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede exchanges a hesitant look with Kiibo, but they both do as instructed and follow her inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The loading screen flickers to life and back out again, and Kaede notes the extremely cluttered inside of the small building. She also notices Miu standing a few feet from her, hunching her shoulders over something.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu quickly fidgets on the spot, seeming to shove her ID back into her pocket, before spinning around saying, “Say something, Bakamatsu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Kaede frowns, shaking her head. “No, I guess we should start looking around, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo appears behind her, and Kaede can’t help but notice Miu frown slightly, furrowing her brow as if confused about something. Kiibo seems to notice, saying, “Is something—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope, nope,” Miu says. “Now, c’mon, let’s make sure the best team finds this bitch, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles in exasperation. “Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede begins to move to search through a pile of assorted boxes, each stuffed to the brim with junk, all too aware that she is likely out of the loop of something very, very bad.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As you probably noticed, things are a bit different in the program world than in canon, as due to its nature this was one of the few things I felt comfortable playing around with a little. And, yes, most changes will be important for the trial, haha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And there should be a victim next chapter, too! So that will be fun.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The church is absurdly full of boxes, which in turn are absurdly full themselves, and Kaede stops counting the sheer amount of golden Miu statues she pulls out, lining them up behind her in a tiny army.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems to be having similar results, though he also remains silent, only pulling mildly concerned—or perhaps mildly disappointed—faces as he removes countless of other seemingly useless objects from his boxes. With little noise other than the shuffling of their respective searches passing through the room, Kiibo finally decides to clear his throat with a forced cough before asking, “Miu? Do you mind if I ask you something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hums from her own place near the front of the church, noticeably less invested in organizing the various piles of objects dumped haphazardly around her. “Yeah,” she says, only half listening to him. “What’s up, Kiibs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “You’ve mentioned many times that you have the ability to add and remove objects from this world, so why is this place so…” he looks around, searching for the word among the mess surrounding them. “Full?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu waves a hand dismissively, still seemingly staring at something in front of her. “Extra assets,” she says. “Removing absolutely everything would be an even bigger pain in the ass than setting up all this shit already was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says, gesturing with an Miu statue in her hand. “But isn’t some of this stuff things you added?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu huffs. “Programming isn’t that fucking simple, Bakamatsu!” she says, finally shoving something in her pocket and turning to face them. “Especially when you’re dealin’ with a shitty shoe-string program like this one. Crap’s built on top of other crap, and sometimes when you mean to make ten of something you end up with a thousand!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I don’t really know much about computers, but…” she looks to Kiibo for support. “Is that true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course it’s fucking true!” Miu says. “Would I fucking lie to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede exchanges another look with Kiibo as he lets out a sigh. “I suppose not—and besides,” he turns back to the boxes in front of him. “Our objective is not to interrogate Miu. It is to find the hint about the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares after him, recalling what he had said to her earlier. She never took Kiibo as the type to run away from difficult topics, and she can’t help but notice the odd stiffness in his avatar’s movements, as if he were physically carrying his hesitation tight in his shoulders. She looks to him and then to Miu, deciding to speak for him, “Miu, there’s something else we need to ask you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah?” she says, crossing her arms. “Not like we got all the time in the fucking world, so spit it out—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why did you create this world in the first place?” Kaede asks. “When you first brought it up, you talked about it like it was a way for everyone to escape, but it’s not, and earlier when it was just the three of us, you said you didn’t care about the others, and,” she takes a deep breath, squaring her shoulders. “And this also seems like a lot of work for you to go through if you don’t actually care about everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We want to believe the best in you, Miu,” Kiibo chimes in. “I… I want to believe the best in all of my friends, but… you especially, but there are a lot of things I am having trouble overlooking as suspicious.” He bows his head. “Please understand where we are coming from.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s eyes dart between them, and she squirms on the spot, faltering under their scrutiny at an alarming rate. “I just—!” she begins. “I just really…!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head, tugging at her hair, and Kaede hears Kiibo very softly say, “Miu…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts over him. “I’m just really fucking scared, okay!?” She starts pacing, gesturing wildly as she does so. “Th-This place if fucking hell, and the mastermind is gonna come and fucking kill me—l-like they did to Himiko!—or they’re gonna t-trick someone’s dumbass, and then <i>they’ll</i> kill me, and,” she presses her hands to her face, her entire tiny avatar trembling as she sinks to her knees, “and every goddamn second in that world is a second I’m likely to fucking die!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo approaches her hesitantly, kneeling and placing a supportive hand on her shoulder. “You,” he says, voice barely rising over Miu’s whimpering. “You just want to be safe… is that why you created this world, Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Fucking… how can either of you trust fucking <i>anyone?</i>” she says. “Even in here, I don’t want any of those assholes near me. I just… I just <i>know</i> they’re waiting to kill someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip, very aware how little she can refute Miu’s paranoia, extreme as it may be. “Are we the only people you trust?” she asks gently.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said you were!” Miu shouts, jerking her head up. “I already said that the three of us are the only people we can even think about relying on without being fucked in the ass! But then you said—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We refused your plan to cooperate,” Kiibo says, staring at the ground. “I see. You were already planning this world before hand, but you only started in earnest once we rejected your offer.” He shakes his head. “My apologies, Miu. I… I did not know your feelings were this strong, and I should have taken them more seriously.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu leans on Kiibo to pull herself back up to her feet, mumbling, “don’t apologize—not your fault…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So then,” Kaede says. “What is your plan? The three of us just stay away from everyone else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Miu says, shaking her head. “Much as I’d prefer to keep this to a threesome, I know that’s not fucking possible. Just,” she tosses her hair over her shoulder. “Figured as long as we’re in the program world, I can control shit, and we wouldn’t have to worry about something stabbing a knife in my tits or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then the goal is just to stay here as long as possible to protect ourselves,” Kiibo says, frowning. “Is that… is that the only thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaede. “I mean, I get wanting to stay safe, but this is really temporary, isn’t it? Especially since everyone will probably just leave once we find the secret about our memories or the world or whatever hidden here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu looks over both of them, her avatar sweating profusely. “U-Uh, well…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo sighs. “Miu, I really do trust you. Please,” he clasps her tiny hands in his. “Please tell us the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her entire face starts to glow pink, and her stammering increases as her confidence dissolves. “W-W-Well, th-that’s, um.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a distinctly more threatening look than Kiibo’s sympathetic expression, finally prompting Miu to half shout, “F-Fine! It’s a quarantine, okay!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quarantine?” Kaede echoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” she says. “They all just stay on their side of the river, and we stay over here, and everything’s fine!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You wanted to trap the others here?” Kiibo asks, voice stern. “But wouldn’t they starve?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shakes her head rapidly. “N-No! I-I mean I’d let ‘em out eventually after the three of us do some shit to, you know,” she shrugs, “find things, prepare stuff, figure out who the fucking mastermind is—make crap easier for ourselves without worrying about corpses poppin’ up all over the place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede says. “The way to log out is on their side? Aren’t we the ones who are trapped in the program if something happens to the bridge?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu bites her lip, obviously debating something, though Kiibo gently squeezing her hands saying, “Miu…” seems to be enough to convince her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay, fine,” she says. “There’s some shit I left out of the grand tour—namely the fact that I can veto if people get to log out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu!” Kaede yells.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cowers. “E-Everyone can still leave now, though!” she says quickly. “I-I haven’t set it to reject anyone, s-so nothing’s <i>really</i> been decided yet, so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s why you were so upset Tenko decided to stay behind,” Kaede says. “I think I get it now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do as well,” Kiibo says, sighing deeply and letting go of Miu’s hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The gesture causes her to falter further, and Miu extends a shaking hand to him, “C-C’mon, Kiibs—I wasn’t-I wasn’t gonna do anything bad!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I still would like to believe that is the truth, but,” he shakes his head. “I cannot approve of your actions. I suppose… I suppose I am simply disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her own frustrations over Miu’s secrecy, Kaede can’t help but feel a bit sympathetic for the other girl due to just how crushed she looks at his words.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo turns his back to them and calmly walks over to the boxes he had been searching through. “I suppose now that that is answered, we should resume our search. The secret of the outside world is likely still worth finding and may still be hidden somewhere around here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s avatar seems to be trembling slightly, and Kaede lets out a deep sigh as she finds she can’t completely squash all of her compassion. “Miu,” she says. “Here, it’ll be faster if we look together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu looks to her weakly before nodding her head, not even bothering with making pretenses of hiding her moping as she turns back to the piles of stuff in front of her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede approaches, and Miu softly mumbles to her, “I was gonna save Kiibs, too, you know.” She looks at the boxes in front of her. “I was always gonna save him…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their search becomes far quieter and far more awkward after that, and they search fruitlessly in silence until Kaede decides she can’t take it anymore.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She darts a glance back at Kiibo before whispering, “You know, I think if you apologize, he’ll forgive you. Even if,” she frowns, “well, even though you made this place as a trap for everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu scowls. “I know I fucked up, Bakamatsu—what do you want from me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, finding it difficult to ignore the gnawing feeling of irritation of Miu only seeming to feel guilty due to Kiibo’s reaction rather than the full implications of her plan. “I understand what it’s like to feel paranoid,” Kaede says. “And like you can’t trust anyone, but doing rash things just gets more people hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shakes her head. “Bullshit—you’ve always had people fucking flocking around you. I mean,” she empties a box onto the floor with a loud clatter, “yeah Sighara turned out to be a murderer, but he never fucking went after you, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Miu,” Kaede cuts her off sharply. “I’m actually trying to help you so could you shut up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She drops the box to the ground, wilting in on herself. “I-I-I just meant I—” she shrugs helplessly. “Trustin’ peoples your thing,” Kaede winces at her words, though Miu doesn’t seem to notice, “and it always works out for you, and—oh!” she snaps her fingers. “I ever fucking tell you I finally got my drone back for horsefucker?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “You mean Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Same difference,” she dismisses with a wave of her hand, turning back to absently sort through the junk piled on the floor. “Point is, thing had been fucking missing since weedhead-dyejob kicked it, and it turns out the little cocksucker just had it piled under all his shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has very little idea what point Miu’s trying to make as she says, “I’m glad for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What I’m tryin’ to say,” Miu says. “Is people just steal shit from me and try to force me to make crap for ‘em—but you have one talk with someone and suddenly they’re on their knees, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Miu, I really don’t have as easy a time getting along with people as you think I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, everyone fucking likes you more than me!” she says, voice raising to a shout. “And I don’t get why—I’m smarter, my boobs are better, I make all the shit everyone wants me to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You also insult everyone,” Kaede points out. “Like, almost all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well so does fucking no-tits assassin bitch, and she gets a stupid prince charming trippin’ all over himself, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kaede says. “Are you jealous?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hands in the air. “I don’t know! Fucking—” she cuts herself off, physically turning away from Kaede. “I just wanna get the fuck out of this hell…” and Kaede barely catches her mumble, “finally go somewhere where people fucking appreciate me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to respond, though as she turns back to her own search, she distinctly catches Kiibo watching out of the corner of her eye. She supposes she can’t blame him due to the sheer volume of their conversation, and when Miu storms past them, announcing she’s going to look at a few things on the far side of the church, he hesitates for only a moment before approaching Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His first words are, “Kaede, was I too hard on Miu earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “I mean, no. I feel bad for her, but she still basically set this world up as a trap and lied to the others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” he says, frowning. “I was in the right. Still…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think you should apologize, if that’s what you’re getting at,” Kaede says. “But maybe tell her you’re still her friend or something. I think, it was actually Miu, herself, who said that you can still like or admire someone even if they make mistakes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods slowly. “She said that about Kirumi. That our situation forces people to do bad things, but that is not their entire character…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She offers him a sympathetic smile. “I don’t think she said it quite as eloquently as that, but yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo smiles. Then he calls out, “Miu,” and shuffles over to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede catches pieces of their conversation, though decides to give the two of them as much privacy as she can as she focuses on her search anew. A few boxes later, and it occurs to her she has no real idea what she’s looking for, though nothing catches her eye as suspicious as most of the boxes are filled with the same repetitive times—statues, mothballs, coats, books that talk repetitively talk about how great Miu is, and stuff seemingly meant for the beach rather than the snowing landscape surrounding them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She absently tosses a brightly colored beach ball over her shoulder when she catches Miu laughing, her previous good mood seemingly restored.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede allows herself a glance back and sees the two of them only giving searching the church a token effort, but sharing bright smiles. Miu tosses her hair over her shoulder, saying, “Sooooo what do you think, then Kiibs? After we get out of here, would you wanna go on a hot date with a babe like me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo tilts his head. “I am not sure I understand. I… would not like to, ahem,” his artificial skin begins to burn red, “date someone who is <i>like</i> you, but… just you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He begins to stammer out an elaboration, and Kaede smiles as she looks back to see Miu slack jawed and bright pink. There is quite a bit more she feels the need to sort out with Miu, though she supposes that can be done in time. For now a relative peace seems to have settled over the three of them, and Kaede makes the choice that finding the secret of the outside world is pretty important. After all, she spares them another glance over her shoulder, and gleams that Kiibo appears to have done the bulk of the work in talking Miu out of whatever half-baked scheme she had planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In spite of her efforts, however, Kaede finds little of interest. After what she idly assumes must have been the hundredth box, she turns to an equally exhausted Miu and Kiibo. She sighs, preparing to admit defeat. “Either of you find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have not,” Kiibo answers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu has both her hands in a box and appears to be frowning hard at something, but mumbles, “Barren as your sex life over here, too, Bakamatsu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “<i>Anyway</i> maybe we should go meet up with the others to see if they found anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” Kiibo says. “Perhaps we could search the perimeter first, though I am doubtful there are many other places that could hide…” he frowns. “This would be quite a bit easier if we knew what we were looking for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “Okay, okay, that sounds good, but, uh,” she gestures vaguely towards Kaede. “Hey, whale tits, could you grab that surfboard on your way out? There might have been a weird freak accident with the bridge or something earlier…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a moment to close her eyes and take in and let out a deep breath. She does as she’s instructed anyway, taking the surfboard in her tiny hands. “Hey, Kiibo,” she says approaching the door. “Can you swipe my card for me? It’s just in my backpack, and my hands are a little full.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Of course, if,” he turns to Miu. “Will the system allow that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says, swiping her own card. “Shouldn’t be much of a fucking problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods again, sending Kaede a quick affirmative smile before shuffling around her to get her card from her bag. He swipes them both, and Miu hurries outside first without a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows lingering will likely draw suspicion, so she’s quick when she says, “seems like Miu’s happy again.” She gives him a teasing smile. “Did you promise to be her prince charming when we get out of here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s face burns. “I, um,” he steps out of the way, pressing his fingers together and staring at the ground. “Please go ahead, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs. “I’ll help you keep an eye on her, but I don’t think we’ll need to worry much about Miu now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you for your support,” he says, though obviously still embarrassed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles again before carefully maneuvering the surfboard horizontally to get in through the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The loading screen blinks into existence and back out, and Kaede shakes her head, forgetting how disorienting it had been after spending so long just in the church. Miu’s standing a few feet down the path, her back turned to her, and her shoulders hunched. At the sound of Kaede’s steps behind her, she seemingly fiddles with something before turning to face her with a sharp frown.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Something wrong?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” Miu says. “Just thought something was kinda weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo appears suddenly, and Miu furrows her brow. As he approaches, he repeats, “Miu, is something wron—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no, nothing,” she says. “I was just, uh,” she glances around, and her eyes worryingly settle on Kaede. “I was just tellin’ Bakamatsu all about our hot date, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though it’s an obvious lie, Kaede finds it amusing and harmless enough to play along. “I think it’s really sweet,” she says, causing Kiibo to blush even harder. “You know, Tsumugi also thinks you two are really cute together—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No shit,” Miu says. “Shittygane wants up to hook up, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “She didn’t exactly say that, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo moves forward to take the surfboard from Kaede’s hands. “Perhaps I will go on ahead then,” he says quickly. “You two can search the perimeter of the church, and, ahem, discuss whatever you like. I will meet you at the mansion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs, giving up the surfboard easily enough. “Aw, are you sure you don’t want to walk around with Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Bakamatsu,” Miu snorts. “Give ‘im a break. Lesser men have overheated at one sight of my hot—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will see the two of you later then!” he says, hurriedly shuffling off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smile as she watches him go before finally disappearing through the loading zone. With him safely past the soundproof barrier, she decides to pose the same question she had to Kiibo only moments earlier, “So I take it the two of you made up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrugs. “Well, yeah.” She kicks at a bit of snow and starts walking forward to begin their search of the church’s perimeter, Kaede walking alongside her. “I mean, Kiibs did what he always fucking does—he tells me everything’ll be fine and we’re safe together and he’s my friend and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t seem happy about that,” Kaede observes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like fuck I’m not happy,” Miu says. “I’m fucking ecstatic, just,” she screws up her face. “He’s too fucking nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s bad?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Miu says, staring hard at the ground. “It’s not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s clearly something weighing on Miu’s mind, though she remains tightlipped for the rest of their walk around the church. Kaede almost idly suggests they take another lap to double check for anything they missed, and Miu shrugs, agreeing easily enough.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The crunch through the snow even as their tiny feet leave no footprints, and Miu says, “Hey—Sluthar—Shuichi was really nice to you and shit, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “He was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu looks forward. “Figured.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her another hard look, trying to piece what could possibly go in the other girl’s head from the simplified expression on her avatar’s face. But far too little is portrayed for Kaede to string anything together.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two continue their march in the snow, and though Kaede catches Miu occasionally attempting to secretly fiddle with something in her pocket, she remains silent, simply searching for whatever secret drove them to the virtual world in the first place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the computer room, Tenko sits in her chair with her legs folded up against her chest, resting her chin atop her knees. The arguing from outside the door floats in on occasion before returning to hushed voices that Tenko can’t make out anything but a few scattered words from. Their conversation—heated as it is—is currently in one of those quiet lulls, and Tenko lets her eyes drift over everyone still plugged into the program.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A voice gnawing in the back of her head reminds her that they’ve been in the simulation for a really long time. It was before the morning announcement that they all entered, and the many digital computer clocks around the room tell her it’s approaching evening.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Again, she thinks how everyone has been in for so long. Well—her eyes drift back to the ajar door—not everyone. Perhaps it’s the quiet yet burning conversation just out of range of her hearing or sitting alone for as long as she has, but Tenko’s nerves are starting to fray at the seems, and she stands, stretching her back to run through some simple stretches again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko moves slowly, her light steps barely making any noise over the soft beeps from the computers, occasional whirring of fans, and whatever hissed discussion is happening just outside the room. She’s bent in half to stretch down to her toes when a sudden clanking noise echoes behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She whips around, and footsteps echo behind her, altered as well by the odd sound. The two enter from outside, and Tenko hears, “Hey, what was that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then she hears a familiar chime and, “A body has been discovered!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They stand, absolutely stunned for a second as the message plays idly in the background. Through the roaring in her head, Tenko finds a single point of clarity, and she shouts, “Check everyone’s pulses!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Favoritism causes her to rush to Kaede’s side first, and she echos a deep sigh of relief at quickly confirming the other girl is alive. They move, checking the others one by one, the subtle, creeping dread increasing with each person confirmed to still be breathing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And everyone is. For a second, Tenko stands, furrowing her brow in pure confusion before the only possible solution strikes her all at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sheer horror of the situation slows her steps, but she manages to walk across the room and slowly lift the visor off of Kiibo’s face. There is no reaction. His eyes remain closed, and his body sits slightly collapsed in his chair. There is no pulse or breath or heartbeat to check, but there is absolutely no denying the body before Tenko’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rushes back to her empty chair, offering only the hurried explanation of, “Tenko needs to tell the others!” as she shoves the wires into her headset. It’s over her eyes, and she’s flipping the switch before a single word can be said against her actions.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches Miu wobble across the makeshift bridge Kiibo had set up earlier, the surfboard standing strong under her weight. It still shifts slightly from side to side, and Miu holds her hands out to help her balance as she takes the last few steps to the outstretched dock on the other side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Kaede says. “Now we just need to head to the mansion, and…” she cuts herself off, noticing Miu staring fixatedly as something behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns and starts in surprise at seeing a tiny version of Tenko rushing up to them, the bow on the back of her head almost comically large compared to the rest of her body.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede! Miu!” Tenko calls out, her feet moving quickly under her. “Where are the others!? Tenko can’t find them!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Can’t find?’” Kaede echoes. “They’re all—” she shakes her head. “Tenko, why are you here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Get lonely, Chabashitra?” Miu asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko finally catches up to them, and shakes her head, her pigtails whipping back and forth around her. “No! It’s an emergency! Tenko was just sitting in the computer room when—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels herself pale. “There’s been another murder, hasn’t there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods quickly. “Yes! The body announcement suddenly went off, and, and, uh…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, fucking spit it out already!” Miu says. “You tryin’ to keep us from clima—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s Kiibo,” Tenko says. “His body suddenly—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“WHAT!?” Miu screams.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“His body just seemed to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>What?</i> This can’t—!” Miu shakes her head wildly, the features of her avatar seem incapable of fully expressing her horror, but Kaede begins to see what she thinks are tears already flickering in her virtual eyes as she physically pushes past Tenko, running at full speed back towards the main house, chanting, “no, no, no, no, no,” at rapid fire to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s turns to stare after her, while Kaede takes a moment to process her sheer shock. “How… how could… we were together almost the whole time…” she shakes her head. “Tenko, did anything happen on your side?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know very much about computers,” she says quickly. “But she didn’t see anything wrong with him. Maki and Kaito also didn’t seem to notice anything—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says, doing a double take. “Kaito and Maki were with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “They had both logged out of the program—the three of us were together when the body announcement went off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks again. “Did—did they say why they were—” she shakes her head. “Tell me on the way—we need to find the others and get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says, and they start running back to the mansion. Hey voice is a touch unsteady as she runs, but Tenko manages to say, “Tenko didn’t see anyone else on her way here—do you know where the others are Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They should just be in the mansion, and the two of us can—” Kaede cuts herself as the sudden memory of her handing her card to Kiibo flashes into her head. “Crap—this might be bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can’t get back into the mansion,” Kaede answers. “I gave Kiibo my ID card?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They’re close enough to the mansion now, and Tenko slows her pace, looking at her in confusion. “ID card?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, everyone has ID cards they need to use to get from place to—” Kaede skids to a stop as the deeper meaning behind Tenko’s words catch up to her. “Wait. How did you get here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Tenko appeared in a strange lounge type place, looked around for the others, and then went outside.” She notices the panic beginning to settle over Kaede’s face, and she quickly adds, “There, were also, um, weird black spaces that happened whenever Tenko went through a door way, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Check your pockets,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks at her warily but does as instructed. She manages to a pull a similar ID card to the ones Kaede had seen everyone else use out of her pocket and blinks at it a few times. Her obvious confusion prompts Kaede to say, “You didn’t use that on the card readers, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There are card readers?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but curse under her breath. “Shit,” she shakes her head and starts walking towards the mansion again. “Tenko, keep this between us okay—if anyone asks, say you used the card on,” they approach the front doors, and Kaede gestures towards the apparently superfluous card reader, “that thing okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods but furrows her brow in concern. “Tenko will, but, Kaede, is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kaede says. “I think there’s a lot about this world that we still don’t know, and now there’s been a murder.” She shakes her head. “I have a really bad feeling about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip, shifting on the spot. “Tenko is sure that that is all very important, Kaede, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re right,” she says. “We need to get everyone, and… and got to Kiibo’s…” the rush she had felt earlier—even if it was born from panic—suddenly vanishes. She had spoken with Kiibo not half an hour ago—the idea that he’s suddenly gone doesn’t even seem real, and Kaede doesn’t even feel grief but instead an aching, hollow pit. “We need to go to him,” she decides on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They enter the mansion one at a time at Kaede’s insistence, even as she wonders just how unnecessary that action might be. Kaede blinks to clear her vision, and a blue blob appears at the end of the hallway. She blinks a bit more and identifies it as Tsumugi at roughly the same time Tenko calls out, “Tsumugi!” and starts to run over to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at them. “Tenko?” she asks. “What are you doing here—did something…” she suddenly looks down at the ground. “Oh no. Oh no, oh no.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries over to them. “Tsumugi, do you know what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She seems a bit more on edge that usual as she shakes her head. “Not the exact details, but,” she bites her lip. “Something happened to Kiibo, didn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How did you know?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I went to the basement with him, and, well—actually,” she shakes her head. “I’ll tell you later—Kokichi and Ryoma are probably wondering where I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are they up ahead?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “We, um, we were all in the same area, and then Kokichi said he heard something weird, so we all went upstairs and saw Miu running by in a panic, and, well, she would plainly only do something like that if—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But weren’t you supposed to be up here with Maki?” Kaede asks, a bit too aggressively.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sweats. “Sh-She left! S-So I went down to the basement with Kiibo, and, um…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wants to yell another question at her, but Tenko places a hand on her shoulder as she firmly says, “We need to get out of here—we can talk with Tsumugi later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut for a moment, desperately trying to process just how things fell apart as she stammers, “R-Right—sorry, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods weakly, muttering to herself, “Poor, Kiibo… why him?” as she swipes her card, Tenko and Kaede watching the action perhaps a bit too intensely. She walks through the door, leaving the two of them to briefly stare at each other.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but let out a shaking breath as she tries to piece together what’s in front of her. Aloud she says, “Did <i>anyone</i> do what they were supposed to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Kaede,” Tenko says again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” she answers. “You go first—if the others ask for any reason, just tell them I have my card, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, still obviously concerned as she hesitatingly moves her card over the reader, staring questioningly at it as she does so. Kaede waits a few seconds, squeezing her hands into fists and preparing to take the steps that will lead her to another one of her friend’s bodies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And she can’t help but think again, <i>I was just talking to him</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She squares her shoulders and steps through the doorway. The darkness engulfs her, and then fades back out again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the room before her, she catches the last images of Tsumugi’s form being engulfed in light in front of the phone, and hears Kokichi nonchalantly explaining to Tenko how logging out works. He stops abruptly, and looks around her towards Kaede. “Ryoma already logged out, so it’s just the three of us left. And Kiibo, too, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely resists the urge to slap him across the face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, also, Kaede-chan, a moment of your time,” Kokichi says, flashing her a grin.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko immediately begins to pull a face, but Kaede swiftly walks over to place a hand on her arm. “It’s alright, Tenko. You go ahead. I can handle this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns but relents. “If you’re sure,” she walks to the phone, squinting at it suspiciously as she says “Tenko Chabashira.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s avatar disappears from the world in a flash of light, and Kaede is left alone with Kokichi. “Whatever you’re about to say,” she says. “Make it quick—we need to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry about that,” he says, folding his hands behind his head. “To tell the truth, I think we all learned a little something from this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” she hisses. “If you’re about to say something about Kiibo not counting as a victim because he’s a robot—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says. “Nothing like that. Just,” he tilts his head, seeming to think for a moment how to phrase his next words, “I think I’m just thinking about the past. Seems like it finally caught up with us is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that means…?” Kaede prompts, quickly loosing patience.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means,” he hums. “It means if I were you, I would trust as many people as you did back when Rantaro died.” He smiles brightly. “That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “You know what happened, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips over to the phone. “Would you believe me if I said I did?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows this routine far too well, but this time, she has evidence to help her. “I already know that you lied earlier. Tsumugi told me that you said you heard Miu from the basement, and that’s impossible be—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—Because the loading screens make every room soundproof,” Kokichi finishes. “That’s right. I mean, there’s always a chance Tsumugi was lying, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” she says sharply. “I’m not going to play games with you about this, and if you had any part in what happened to Kiibo, then, then—” she shakes her head, physically feeling the anger boiling up inside, and she snaps, “Then I hope you’re really, really, really <i>fucking</i> proud of yourself. I hope you’re proud of everyone you’ve hurt, and I hope that you get absolutely everything you wanted out of this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares at her for a moment, and then says with almost no emotion, “Kokichi Oma,” and he vanishes in a beam of light.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at the spot where he was standing, a tiny flickering voice in the back of her mind wonders if she went too far, but Kaede quiets it with a shake of her head. She approaches the phone, picking it up with a shaking hand, knowing fully well what will start when she gets to the other side. “Kaede Akamatsu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The ring of light appears around her feet, and with that, the program world is just as dead as when they entered it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The world fades back to black, and Kaede blinks her eyes for a few seconds, taking in the new darkness before dully realizing it’s simply the turned off headset resting over her face. Sound begins to filter back into her world—there’s some talking in hushed whispers, but rising above them is Miu’s distinct hurried mumbling, broken only by cracks in her choked voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls her headset off, and blinks a few more times to clear her vision. The sight of Miu frantically moving around Kiibo’s still body, haphazardly bringing her arm up to wipe her tears with the back of her hand before returning to her skittering unfolds in Kaede’s vision before anything else. Everything else seems irrelevant anyway.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears movement nearby, and turns her head to notice Tenko standing beside her, staring at Miu with the deepest sympathy in her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede allows herself to follow her gaze again, and there’s an awkward stillness in the room as if saying anything to interrupt Miu’s half sobbed whispers would be disrespectful. Kaede makes out part of one as, “c’mon, c’mon, fuck, c’mon—Kiibs—c’mon, you-you have to be fine—you have to…” and forces herself to tune out, not wanting to invade Miu’s privacy even as everyone openly stares at her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone is quiet, even Kokichi who sits in his chair, absently swinging his short legs. Kaede takes a deep breath and stands. She takes a step towards Miu, saying, “Miu, he—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu suddenly jolts at her words, screaming “I can fix him!” With her eyes still locked on Kiibo’s body she repeats again, “I can—I—” she turns to the others, a near desperate expression on her face. “Someone—help me carry him to my lab—I can’t do it by myself!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others take perhaps a second too long to answer, and Miu jerks back to Kiibo’s body, tugging at his arm, biting out, “F-Fine! Then I <i>will</i> do it m-myself!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki walks over, brushing Miu aside with a bump of her shoulder. Kaede’s about to scold her for such an action when Maki casually bends Kiibo’s body at the waist slightly before hauling him up and over her shoulders. Kaede stutters, “H-Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Harumaki, isn’t Kiibo like really fucking heav—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shrugs nonchalantly. “It’s not that bad. Miu,” she turns to the other girl. “Open doors for me on the way there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu sputters out of her state of shock and sprints to the doors of the computer room, yanking them open. Maki heads to the doors at a casual stroll, pausing only briefly to send a pointed look to Kaito that he returns. Everyone just stands in silence, letting only Maki’s footsteps carry through the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors finally swinging shut when the two girls leave breaks the spell as Kokichi says, “So, I suppose this is the really dangerous part.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tsumugi asks hesitantly. “Y-You mean investigating so we can guess the culprit right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” says Ryoma suddenly, his deep voice startling Kaede. “He’s talking about what happened last time.” His eyes slide over to Kokichi. “That right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nods. “Mhmm,” he looks at his shoes, absently kicking the bottom of his chair as he swings his legs. “Now’s the time when anyone can kill anyone—which means things are super dangerous especially for me, right no—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says sharply, his sudden, passionate outburst also surprising Kaede. “No, that’s not…” he looks to the ground, and Kaede squints as she inspects him. Something about him seems off. Her first thought is that his bright confidence seems to missing, but then he slams his fists together, loudly announcing. “That’s not gonna fucking happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you can be sure about that?” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi begins saying, “I don’t think anyone here would go after—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m going to protect you,” Kaito announces, staring directly at Kokichi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi abruptly stops swinging his legs, and the statement is out of place enough to make Kaede says, “<i>What!?”</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaito seems to suddenly become aware of everyone staring at him in near shock, and he barely hides the falter in his bravado, saying, “I mean—I’m also gonna fucking make sure he doesn’t screw any shit up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“How are you planning to do that Kaito?” Tenko asks quizzically.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“I’d like to know that, too,” Kokichi hums.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede asks, “Why are you planning to do that?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaito throws his hands in the air. “Because he fucked with the last case—I don’t know!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“That’s not an answer,” Ryoma says coolly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“Do, um,” Tsumugi stutters. “Do you really think the mastermind is going to go after Kokichi?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaito glances around the room before staring hard at Kokichi, likely attempting to signal the smaller boy to give him an answer. Kokichi remains quiet, staring up at him evenly. Kaito lets out a sigh, “I’m just… I just really have to do this.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede looks between them, attempting to possible figure out what’s happening. Under the roar of her thoughts, Tenko asks, “Do you have something you need to talk to Kokichi about?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“If you do, do it here,” Ryoma says, not even hiding the challenge in his voice. “I’m sure we’d all like to hear it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>A tense silence settles over them, one which it seems Kaito has no response for. Kokichi rescues him then. “Geeze, Kaito,” he says, hopping to his feet. “If you want to spend time alone with me that badly, you could have just told me.” He folds his hands behind his head, walking over to him as if the other boy’s behavior wasn’t bizarre enough to make Kaede’s head hurt. “I don’t really like big public displays anyway, you know. I think I’d prefer to keep things just between us.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaito narrows his eyes at Kokichi’s words, and Kaede is all too aware that she is missing whatever silent conversation is happening between them. And Kaito doesn’t protest, merely shaking his head before looking back to the others. “We’ll just… fucking stay in my room until the investigation is over or something—too risky with the,” he gestures vaguely, “bodies in two places crap.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“Neither of you are going to investigate?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“I don’t think they need to,” Kaede answers, narrowing her eyes at Kokichi. “Or at least, one of them doesn’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kokichi returns her glare with a bland expression. Then his normal, cheerful smile appears back on his face, and he practically starts bouncing around Kaito, asking, “So are you gonna play with me for the whole investigation, Kaito?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaito lets out another deep sigh. “I guess. Come on,” he glances to Kaede, almost physically unable to hide the guilt in his expression, “sorry I’m not gonna fucking help this time either, but… this is important.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Tenko takes a step toward them. “Why is this important?” she asks, voice pleading. “Kaito, why did you log out of the program earlier, and why are you saying someone’s going to hurt Kokichi, and why are you hiding secrets from everyone?” She shakes her head. “The last person who acted like you did was Himiko, you know that, right?” He doesn’t answer, and Tenko’s voice spikes, “Right!?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>He doesn’t yell back at her, and that’s probably what concerns Kaede most of all. Instead, Kaito directs his eyes somewhere to the side of Tenko’s, muttering, “I’m really fucking sorry.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>He starts walking away then, Kokichi happily skipping at his side as if nothing had happened.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Tenko’s hands curl into fists, and as soon as the doors close, she shakes her head. “Everyone’s hiding something,” she says. “Everyone is keeping secrets, and Tenko knows…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>A few feet away, Ryoma sighs. “This isn’t about to end well, no.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Tsumugi presses her hands to her heart. “We need to focus on the investigation right now, though, right? Oh, but poor Kiibo… why would anyone go after him?” She takes her glasses off with one hand for a moment to brush away the beginnings of tears forming in her eyes. “I just don’t understand why this would happen to him…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede can’t help but quirk an eyebrow at her words. “Were you two close, Tsumugi?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“Yes, no, maybe,” she answers vaguely. “I just… I just don’t understand why something like this would happen to someone who was so nice…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“Think we’ve all been wondering that for a while,” Ryoma says. He looks to the chair Kiibo had been sitting in. “So, just the four of us then.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede glances around them. “I guess—wait,” just out of the very corner of her hearing, she registers a soft sniffling sound coming from the far corner of the room. With great hesitation, and Tenko walking behind her, ready to attack whatever might be making the sound, Kaede approaches.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>She comes to a desk, and peeks under it to see Monotaro, hiding and sobbing into his scarf. “Daddy…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede just shakes her head as she straightens, looking back to the others. “Never mind, it’s nothing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“That so,” Ryoma says. “Then I suppose we have to go through everything one last time.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>“‘Last time?’” Kaede echoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Ryoma shrugs. “Never mind,” he answers, parroting her words from only seconds ago. “It’s nothing.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Kaede watches him wander back over to Kiibo’s chair, then she hears Tsumugi call out in surprise, likely having found something important, and Kaede takes a moment to close her eyes, internally questioning just how much worse things are going to get.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Fun fact! Kiibo was meant to die this chapter from the very beginning, but in my earliest conceptions (before I had the details planned) he was going to somehow be an accidental culprit like Nanami, which is an idea I still like quite a bit. Also, yes, Kiibo's death does mean I have a new special plan for endgame. ; )</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And this fic has over 600 kudos, which is absolutely amazing, and I just want to thank everyone! And V3's English release is right around the corner, so that's exciting, too!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a mysterious puddle on the floor. Kaede finds herself crouched down next to it after Tsumugi had sounded her shock at finding such a thing near the chair where she had been sitting. Though she focuses her attention on Tsumugi as she begins to talk, Kaede keeps a tentative eye on Ryoma, who seems to be inspecting Kiibo’s headset, and Tenko, who’s on her hands and knees a few feet away from them in an attempt to find whatever the source of the strange liquid might be.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“To speak plainly,” Tsumugi says. “I feel like I would have noticed this if it had been here when I logged into the program world for the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That makes sense,” Kaede says. “So,” she reaches out to touch the chair. “You were sitting here, and you wouldn’t happen to remember who was sitting beside you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, if I recall,” she says. “Ryoma was on one side, and I think Miu was on the other.” She grimaces. “Actually Miu was definitely on the other. She, um, she spits a lot when she talks, and I remember having to clean some off my glasses now that I think about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “Not Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “No, I’m afraid not. So, maybe this isn’t related, even if it is plainly suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re right,” she says. “I don’t think we should ignore it since it is so odd.” She absently starts to reach forward towards the puddle, “but I just wonder how it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” Tenko calls out suddenly. “Don’t touch it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede retracts her hand immediately, looking up to see Tenko scrambling towards her. “What’s the matter?” Kaede asks. “Is it maybe battery acid or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does Kiibo have battery acid?” Tsumugi asks absently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko wouldn’t know the answer to that,” she says quickly. “But she does know that that liquid is poison.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “Poison?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “H-How can you be sure?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko points to direct their attention to a few pieces of broken glass shining in the dim lighting a couple of feet away from the back of the chairs. Kaede furrows her brow as she approaches it, careful not to touch the puddle leaking on the floor. As she does so, Tenko explains, “Tenko found glass shards over there, and there was part of a label on one that said it was poison…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi scrambles away from the puddle. “C-Can it seep through the skin?” she suddenly clasps her hands over her mouth. “W-What about inhaling? Have we breathed in too much already!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, let me see,” Kaede says, now kneeling in front of the remains of what she assumes was a glass bottle. Gingerly, she reaches out to slightly shift the shard of glass with part of the still reasonably intact label on it towards her. Other than being slightly damp, it appears whatever broke the bottle didn’t tear the label, and Kaede ponders this as she reads aloud, “—extremely potent… a single drop can be lethal, however, it must be directly administered orally to take effect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh, um,” Tsumugi slowly brings her hands down. “So then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no need to panic,” Ryoma says dully from his spot by Kiibo’s chair, though seemingly uninterested in their conversation as he continues to fiddle with the headset. “Also better reason for saying the poison is pointless—the victim’s a robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means the real question is,” Kaede frowns at it. “Why would something like this be here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says. “Though Tenko assumes it is impossible Kiibo’s cause of death is poison… what did kill him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she stands, brushing herself off as she does so. “I suppose we have to rely on the Monokuma File and maybe Miu if… she ends up performing an autopsy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How cruel…” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “A mechanic being forced to analyze the body of their dead robot friend—the only thing that could make that situation worse is if they were starving to death or something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, unsure how to respond. “I guess? Anyway,” she moves to pull her monopad from her backpack. “Let’s see what information we do have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She checks for a moment to ensure the others are doing the same before turning back to her screen alight with the information that Kiibo, the Ultimate Robot, is dead. The diagram of his body is unhelpful, listing only that he suffered a major malfunction of unknown origin, though similar to that of a human going into shock. His time of death was six-twenty in the evening, and there are no signs of external damage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath, uncomfortable with how familiar this process has become. “Tenko,” she says, starting the other girl out of her own reading. “You discovered Kiibo—was there anything strange about his body or anything else for that matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sighs. “Well, the only thing that was suspicious to Tenko at the time was the fact that Kaito and Maki were there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” says Ryoma. “So that’s what happened to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah!” Tsumugi says. “That’s right! Ryoma, you and Kaito were investigating together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you were investigating with Maki,” he replies evenly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, um,” Tsumugi says. “Well, that’s…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him, opting to let Tsumugi’s stuttering slide for now. “Ryoma, do you know something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Know he was a pain to search with. He also made up some dumb excuse to wander around alone with Kokichi for awhile, though I guess his plan was to ditch him, too, apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Kaede asks, unable to keep the concern out of her voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can’t say I know what happened between them,” Ryoma says. “But after I searched by myself for a while, I came back to find that Kokichi was by himself, and the room they had wandered off to was a mess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So he was just gone?” Tsumugi asks. “I guess it’s a good thing Kiibo and I came down to the basement, otherwise you two wouldn’t have been able to leave. Actually,” she frowns. “How did Kaito leave by himself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows the answer and finds herself infinitely thankful at Tenko quickly saying, “If it matters, when Kaito woke back up, he seemed really confused.” She fidgets nervously, “Um, Tenko had also been watching the clocks a lot since she was alone for… a long time, and Tenko remembers it was about five-forty when he started panicking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Panicking?’” Kaede echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “He started thrashing around a lot when he first woke up and seemed very insistent about logging back in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But he didn’t,” says Ryoma. “There a reason for that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tenko frowns. “Tenko tried to help him, but then,” she bites her lip. “Maki suddenly logged out, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “It was at the same time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe they coordinated then,” Ryoma says. “They’d have had to have done it before we split up though… and,” he pulls at his hat, “personally, Kaito doesn’t strike me as a particularly good actor—doubt he could trick someone like Tenko, who actually knows him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Tenko says hesitantly. “Tenko,” she sighs, “Tenko knows she stayed behind because we can’t trust anyone, but she also really wants to believe that Kaito wasn’t lying… even if he’s been acting strangely ever since he did log out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede offers her a sympathetic smile. “Well, he might be our friend,” she says. “But he’s still an awful boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko returns her smile. “He is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Kaede says. “We can get his side of the story later, too, but I’m less sure Maki is going to be willing to just say what she was doing, even if she’s not the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe I can help a little? Since, well, we were plainly supposed to be exploring together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Ryoma says. “So how did that go wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi flinches slightly at his words. “Well, we looked around the main house together for a while, but we didn’t find anything, and then Maki told me to swipe my card to leave because she wanted to check the map in the main hall again, though I guess that was a lie now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you did it?” Kaede asks. “And then she just left?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “That’s right. As soon as we got back into the main hall, she just walked away without another word and left to go to the salon. I wasn’t sure if I should follow her or not since we all agreed to search together, but I couldn’t get into the basement by myself, and Miu knocked the bridge down, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I forgot about that,” Kaede says, pressing a hand to her forehead. “She said it ‘was an accident’ or something—so that’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “Tenko saw you and Miu crossing a bridge?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We had to use a makeshift one,” Kaede answers. “We actually just ended up using a surfboard in the church—nothing special. In fact, I don’t really know what Miu’s plan to get us back to the other side was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Better question is why she stranded the three of you in the first place,” Ryoma says. “But the murder happened after the two sides were connected again—so I guess it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko suddenly perks up. “Oh, also, if Tenko understands correctly, Miu and Kaede were together the whole time, right? Does that mean they both have to be innocent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Ryoma says, letting out a deep sigh. “That’s a good point—guess they are.” He looks up to Kaede. “Congratulations, Kaede—got an alibi again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns. His words strike a distinctly hostile chord to her, yet Kaede finds herself at a loss for why he would feel that way. Part of her quickly questions if he managed to figure out that she lied about her alibi in the last trial, though how he would know that and <i>why</i> he would hold a grudge over that baffles her into silence.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tenko says. “Ryoma, you, Kokichi, and Tsumugi were also together in the virtual world when Kiibo was killed, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “I mean, I was a little ways away from them, but if anyone was trying to attack Kiibo, I definitely would have heard.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I assume that goes both ways, too,” Kaede says. “You would have heard if Kokichi or Ryoma did anything suspicious, and—and, wait,” she frowns before turning to Tenko. “Tenko, you were here with Kaito and Maki, so does that mean everyone has an alibi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” says Ryoma, an odd look flittering across his face before he turns away from them. Over his shoulder he says, “Maybe it was suicide then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. Behind her, Tsumugi gasps, bringing her hands to her mouth as she stutters, “S-Suicide? B-But why would Kiibo—<i>how</i> could he do that with the laws of robotics?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Laws of robotics?’” Kaede repeats. “What are those?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has never heard of those either,” she chimes in. “Was Kiibo bound by them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Tsumugi says, waving a hand. “He never talked about them, but the three laws of robotics are that, first, a robot can never hurt a human, second, a robot must protect its own existence, and, third, a robot must do whatever a human tells it as long as it doesn’t conflict with the first two laws.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, racking her brain to try to match Kiibo’s behavior with Tsumugi’s words. “I feel like… Kiibo ignored a lot of what he was told to do—mostly because Kokichi or Miu would tell him ridiculous things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “That last one is less important—my main point is that I just don’t think Kiibo would commit suicide. It’s not in his nature.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because he’s a robot?” Kaede asks. “Is that your argument?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, it’s certainly a possibility!” Tsumugi insists. “Either way, I plainly can’t believe Kiibo would abruptly kill himself with no reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he had a reason,” Ryoma says, still turned away from them. “Maybe he found what we were looking for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He likely senses Kaede’s incoming question, and waves his hand dismissively. “Sorry—forget it. I’m saying weird things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t buy his excuse for a second, even as Tsumugi innocently asks, “Oh, Ryoma, are you in mourning then? I didn’t know you and Kiibo were close.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma ignores her question, simply saying, “I said forget it. Anyway,” he lets out a sigh. “We should log back into the program or something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” says Kaede. “Maybe Kiibo’s avatar can tell us something—oh,” she turns to Tenko. “There’s actually one thing I want to ask you first, Tenko. What was Maki like when she logged out of the program? Was she acting strangely?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns for a moment, thinking on the question. “Maki…” she begins. “The entire situation was strange, so Tenko doesn’t know if she noticed anything in particular… she,” Tenko moves to stand in front of Maki’s chair, as if ready to recreate the scene. “She seemed… surprised when she noticed Tenko and Kaito, and he was surprised to see her as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did either of them say anything about it?” Kaede prompts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not in front of Tenko,” she says. “Tenko assumes Kaito decided talking with Maki was more important, since he gave up trying to log back in. Then,” she turns to look towards the doors. “They whispered for a while and went outside to talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They didn’t want you hearing their conversation…” Kaede says more to herself than anyone else. “Why is Kaito acting so weird…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says, fidgeting on the spot. “You don’t think Kaito’s…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Neither of them can say, and Kaede quickly counters with, “I think we should investigate. We’ll probably find something that will really show us what’s going on.” Internally, she adds <i>I hope</i>.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, um,” Tsumugi speaks up. “Is our next step going back into the program world to try and find Kiibo’s avatar?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Kaede says with a nod. “I think all four of us should go, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really now,” Ryoma says. “Seems like Tenko staying behind was helpful last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes closed for a moment. “I hate to say this, but what Kokichi said earlier is true. After what happened to Himiko, we just have to accept that this is the time when we’re in the most danger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks ill, shaking her head. “The idea that one of us would kill someone for no reason just because they could get away with it… ugh, it’s too horrible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she’s right,” Ryoma says. “This is just the world we live in now—for some reason we keep forgetting that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we all have to go in because,” Kaede says. She glances over the three people in front of her. “Because there’s a chance one of us is the culprit or worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Worse?’” Tsumugi parrots. “What’s worse than the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The mastermind,” Tenko says, voice soft. “They’re the one who killed Himiko, and with Kiibo’s death, they could murder anyone… and they could be in this room right now.” Her eyes flicker up to glance over each of them, a profound sadness in her gaze that causes Kaede’s stomach to lurch. “So,” she shakes her head. “Kaede is right—we all have to go in together—it’s the only way to make sure everyone is safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods as she moves back to her chair. “Right—let’s all go together, and,” she takes a deep breath, trying to summon any positive emotion over her own feelings of dread. “And we need to all work together to find out what happened to Kiibo—for his sake as well as all of ours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah!” Tsumugi says. “We can’t give into despair now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pause for a moment, staring hard at the floor. “We can’t… no,” he shakes his head before moving back to his chair. “The idea that we’d all just give up, and let ourselves be killed… it’s stupid. It’d take far more for that to happen…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches up to nervously fiddle with her hat, something about Ryoma’s words making her deeply uncomfortable. However, as she looks back to him almost mindlessly adjusting his headset, she finds herself merely biting her lip. All she can really think as she sits back in her chair and plugging in her headset again is how just how small the list of people she can trust has become. Kokichi told her to trust as many people as she did when Rantaro died. Kaede bites her lip again as Tenko offers her an encouraging smile before she places her own headset over her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pointedly waits to physically see the others enter the virtual world before she moves to turn her own headset back on. None of them seem to falter, though, and it’s soon enough that she’s flicking the switch to join them back in the virtual world.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The codes rushes fast and blaring through her brain again, and she’s left blinking her eyes hurriedly as the flash of light descends around her tiny feet and back into the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The now familiar, simplified, and almost frustratingly cute versions of Tsumugi, Ryoma, and Tenko stand before her, seemingly having recovered from the shock of entering the program.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others stare at her for a moment, and Kaede coughs to clear her throat before providing guidance. “Right, so, now that we’re all here, we should head to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, wait!” Tsumugi suddenly calls out. “I just remembered something strange—Kaede how did you get into this room when you left the program for the first time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks, caught off guard by her question. “Huh? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She points to the card reader. “I just remembered, Kiibo had your ID card—that’s how the two of us got into the basement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says. Then, Tsumugi’s words catch up with her. “Wait—what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think I mentioned this a bit before,” Tsumugi begins. “But after Maki left, I was kind of at a loss. I was just in the entrance hall by myself for a while, but then Kiibo came to try and get everyone together. Since Maki wasn’t there, I didn’t think we could get into the basement, but Kiibo had your card, too, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Ryoma says. “Remember Kiibo having two ID cards when he met up with us. It’s how he…” he suddenly stops, shaking his head. “Actually, Kaede, if Kiibo had your card, how did you even get back into the mansion?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, right!” says Tsumugi. “You would have been locked outside. So how—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu helped me,” Kaede says quickly, the lie coming easily enough. “We realized that Kiibo ran off with my card, so she made me a new one. It’s not really a big deal, so I didn’t think it mattered, too much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu made you a new one?” Ryoma asks. “I understand she can edit this world, but if that’s the case, why didn’t she just make multiple IDs earlier to explore alone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her lie starting to fall out from under her, and she stutters as she supplies, “I-I think it’s more about the spirit of things. I mean, the multiple people rule was implemented because we’re all supposed to work together and get along or something. A person just getting a new ID card wouldn’t really be breaking the rules or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a long look, and Kaede has no doubt that he doesn’t believe a word out of her mouth. In a low voice, he says, “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, um,” Tenko says. “Tenko saw Kaede use her ID when we came back to the house, so she definitely had one then, b-but her second card probably isn’t related to the case since she only used it to get back to log out, and Tenko was with her the entire time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says, perhaps a touch too quickly. “Kiibo having two IDs might be important, but the fact that Miu made me another one really doesn’t affect anything. All it means is that I didn’t have to get stuck outside in the snow, haha.” Her laugh is probably a bit forced, though Kaede knows her best chance is to convince Ryoma not to contradict her as talking him into believing in her seems to be an impossibility.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” he says tersely. “And Tenko and Miu can confirm that then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They can,” Kaede says brightly even as the thought of Miu ruining her lie immediately rages through her mind. “Like I said, it’s really not a big deal—and also while we should remain suspicious of each other to a degree, if we can’t trust anyone even a little, investigating would be impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma watches her for another moment before sighing and walking over to the card reader. “Fine,” he says, dully swiping his card. “I hear you. Let’s just leave it at that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He leaves then, and Kaede squeezes her eyes shut, knowing she lost whatever battle they were having. Tsumugi moves to hurry after him, saying, “Um, we probably shouldn’t keep Ryoma waiting—he seems like he’s in kind of a bad mood.” She swipes her card and sighs. “I really had no idea that Ryoma liked Kiibo so much. Maybe the real love triangle was between them and Miu? Oh, but I hate romance plots with no buildup—they’re always such a let down since there’s no emotional payoff, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure,” Kaede says, very unsure.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, sorry, maybe that didn’t make sense,” she says. “It’s just, like, you have a frog, for example, and then suddenly it meets another frog, and it’s on fire all of a sudden!” Kaede and Tenko give her twin looks of absolute confusion, and Tsumugi stammers, “U-Um, I-I’m going to go catch up with Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll be right after you,” Kaede says. Tsumugi nods and shuffles through the door. With her gone, Kaede turns to Tenko. “Tsumugi seems to have her mind on other things, so I don’t know how much we can rely on her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t think we can rely on Ryoma, either,” Tenko says. “The way he was talking to you earlier… Kaede, do you think he suspects you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “He could be, but, honestly, even though he’s not acting as strange as Kaito, I get the feeling he’s hiding something, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, Ryoma, and Kokichi are all acting strangely,” Tenko shakes her head. “Maybe the culprit really is an awful boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t rule it out,” Kaede answers. “But we probably shouldn’t keep Tsumugi and Ryoma waiting, oh,” she smiles, “and thank you for helping cover for me, by the way. I know it makes things more difficult for you, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is happy to do it,” she says. “Tenko… doesn’t have a lot of people she feels she can rely on now, but she knows Kaede is one of them. And Tenko’s said it before, but she’ll say it again—Tenko would rather die than not be able to believe in the people she trusts.” She smiles gently. “Person she trusts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede again hears Kokichi’s words—<i>as many people as when Rantaro died</i>—as she returns her smile.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Neither of them bother with the card reader on their way out, and their arrival in the entrance hall receives little notice from either Ryoma or Tsumugi who are both busy inspecting the map on the wall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As they approach, Ryoma says, “Basement’s priority—but one of us has to stay behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says as she comes to stand next to them to get a better view of the map, herself. “The last person could maybe look outside or something—there’s always a chance something happened to Kiibo on his way to the mansion that we don’t know about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I could do that,” Tsumugi says. “After all, I was the first person to meet Kiibo when he arrived.” A determined look crosses over her face. “I’ll do my very best to wring out my brain for anything strange he might have said in our conversation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, that sounds like a good idea,” Kaede says. “And the three of us will go down to the basement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re going to trust Tsumugi by herself then,” Ryoma says. “Even though the whole point of this is that we were going to stay together because we can’t trust anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi starts, waving her hand, quickly saying, “Ah—I promise I won’t do anything! Though… I suppose anyone would say that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “Actually, we can all investigate the basement together if someone just waits here for a little while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks at her oddly, clearly wondering if she’s about to break their own promise when Tsumugi gasps, “Oh, I think I know what you’re talking about—Kiibo had two IDs with him, so three people just need to go, grab those and then come back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if someone as fast as Tenko or Ryoma does it,” Tenko says. “There will be no time for anyone to even think of committing murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kaede says. “We’re all the same speed in here, but, yeah!” She pumps her fists. “In that case, I’ll wait here—I trust you guys to do it as fast as possible.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Alright, we’ll be right back Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her an odd look but doesn’t protest as the three of them move to go down to the basement. In their brief absences Kaede lets out a deep breath, briefly wondering how many more times she’ll have to lie to hold up her increasingly shaky charade. She then thinks that the entire purpose behind doing so is because Ryoma or Tsumugi might very well have just killed one of their friends.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Another moment passes as she turns that thought over again. Are they all friends? That had been one of her first promises—they’d all escape and become friends. Kaede squeezes her eyes closed as a brief flash of self loathing over how badly she failed burns through her. Then Tenko appears through the door, saying “Kaede?” and she has to go back to reality.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you find the cards?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko used all three of them in front of Ryoma and Tsumugi, so they’re still on the other side. Here,” she hands Kaede her old card. “Tenko’s… going to go back out of the program.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows we talked a lot about how we all had to go in together, but,” she shakes her head. “She isn’t sure if we can trust Ryoma or Tsumugi, but there’re also the others. Actually, Kaito and Kokichi seemed busy, and Miu is working on Kiibo, but Maki…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “That’s right. God,” she presses her hands to her eyes, and letting out a self deprecating laugh. “How could I forget about Maki trying to kill someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts nervously. “Tenko wasn’t sure how to say this earlier or if she should say it in front of everyone, but,” she bites her lip. “When Maki logged out of the program, for a second, Tenko felt… a killing intent coming from her. Tenko was only able to watch her for a little while since she left with Kaito pretty quickly, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you think it was directed towards Kiibo?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “The person Tenko noticed Maki kept looking at when she logged out was Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi…” Kaede frowns. “Do—wait. Do you think that had anything to do with the way Kaito was acting then? Like, when he said he would protect him? Did he mean from Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she says with a shake of her head. “And she also has no idea how any of that is related to what happened to Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I know there’s still probably a lot we haven’t investigated, but everything we know so far seems so disconnected.” She frowns. “Or maybe I’m just thinking about it wrong…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s face turns grim. “Tenko… only briefly investigated Kiibo’s body, but, um,” she looks to Kaede with far too much concern. “Kaede, the scene of the crime is… strange. Please… make sure you’re ready before you go there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s nerves spike—Tenko has been the bearer of awful news so many times, but had thus far always been direct about it. “I’ll—I’ll try.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles encouragingly and moves to squeezes Kaede’s hands. “Okay. Tenko will watch over everyone from the outside—she promises she won’t let anything happen to you. Or Tsumugi and Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you. I’ll be counting on you,” Kaede says, squeezing her hands back. “Oh, also—Tenko there’s one thing I’d like you to do when you log out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Whatever it is, Tenko will do her best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you talk to the Monokubs?” she asks. “I know they probably won’t help much with the investigation, but see if you can get any information out of them about the card readers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tenko says, suddenly perking up. “Oh! Tenko will ask them, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you also keep it a secret from the others?” Kaede asks quickly. “I mean, I’ll probably talk about it at the trial, but for now…” she takes a deep breath. “There’s a chance we could use this to get the upper hand on the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko understands,” she says. “She will try to keep her investigation quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you,” Kaede says. “I should probably catch up with Ryoma and Tsumugi now before they get too suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Okay. Tenko will see you later.” She squeezes her hands one more time before letting go to hand over her two ID cards, saying, “Just in case Ryoma or Tsumugi are watching. Good luck, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You, too,” Kaede says, smiling after her, as Tenko hurries down the hall and out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone again, Kaede takes another breath to calm herself, remembering Tenko’s warning about the crime scene as she steps through the door down into the basement.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a short staircase she descends easily enough after the loading screen fades out, and it opens out into a short hallway lined with open doorways. Kaede counts eight on each side as she walks down the hall, peeking into each room to see a rather basic setup of a bedroom. More notably—each room is an absolute mess with the sheets torn off the beds, blankets and pillows thrown on to the floor, and other pieces of furniture lying haphazardly on the ground and scattered about even into the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She finds Tsumugi in one room near the end of the hall, and announces her presence as she walks in behind her with, “I wonder how long it’s been since someone cleaned up down here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi starts a bit at her words, spinning on her heel as she says, “Ah! Kaede, I was actually just thinking that same thing,” she brings a hand to her chin, “it’s weird to think that this place is messy when the rest of the house is so nicely organized.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The church was kind of a mess, too,” Kaede answers. “Though there wasn’t stuff just scattered on the floor like this. I think Miu explained it as extra assets or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess that makes sense,” she answers. “Oh, and that actually reminds me—come look over here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows her as Tsumugi turns to a corner and sees a glittering gold statue of Miu lying on the ground. “Huh,” Kaede says. “There were a lot of those in the church, too, and on the shed on top of the roof, but,” she frowns, “maybe I should look harder, but I didn’t see any of those down here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is the first one I’ve seen here, too,” Tsumugi says. “I mean, this place was already kind of torn up when Kiibo and I first came here, so I could have missed some, but I didn’t see a place where you could get a statue from like the shelf in the shed on the roof.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “You think someone brought a statue down here? I guess they’d have to, but, why would someone do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have no idea,” Tsumugi says with a shake of her head. “But anyone who went to the roof or the church could have brought one here, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’d also have to be someone who went to the basement,” Kaede adds. “But it seems strange someone would still carry one around.” She bends down to pick it up, weighing it in her hands. “It’s pretty heavy… You’d definitely have to go out of your way to carry this around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods in agreement. “Maybe someone just thought it was cool?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “That’s a nice theory, though, I think that would narrow down our potential suspects to just Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s probably right,” Tsumugi says with a smile. “But, um,” she glances around the room. “I can look over the other rooms a bit more if you want to go ahead to Kiibo’s avatar… You’ll need to take a second person with you, but I plainly think you and Ryoma should go ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, swallowing her own dread. “Got it. Ryoma’s just in another room or something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” she says. “Um, also, Ryoma knows the layout, better than I do, but I think the basement just consists of this room of dorms and then a library in the back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A library—” Kaede suddenly remembers Tenko’s warning. “Wait—Kiibo’s avatar is in the library?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “When Kiibo and I first came down to the basement, we found Ryoma and Kokichi in one of the rooms near the end of the hall.” She pauses for a second, taking another look around. “I think it was this room actually… um, but then Kokichi said that I should look around this the bedrooms a little more, and Kiibo should go to the library with someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s what you all did?” Kaede prompts. “Who went with Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi tried to volunteer,” Tsumugi says, “but I actually think Ryoma is the one who ended up going with him. Kokichi was kind of upset for some reason, so I think he was hanging around the doorway while I was trying to search the other rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “And Kiibo… was killed in the library?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s right…” Tsumugi says, hugging her arm. She glances around for a moment, and lowers her voice as she says, “Ryoma said his avatar had already stopped moving when he followed after him and he came back almost immediately, but, in all honesty, I really suspect Ryoma did something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says. “Um, I guess I’ll still go with him, though—maybe see if he knows something since he was the first one to find Kiibo’s avatar. Also, do you mind telling me what happened after Ryoma came back? Just so I have a full picture of what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure,” Tsumugi says. “If I remember right—and you can ask Ryoma or Kokichi later in case I mess something up—after Ryoma came back, he said there was something wrong with Kiibo’s avatar. Ryoma had used Kiibo’s ID to get back through the door, but then we all went together to see what had happened… and his body wasn’t moving—it was just lying in the doorway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows. “Um, Tsumugi, this might sound weird, but by any chance… did it remind you of what happened to Rantaro?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi blinks. “I hadn’t been thinking about that, but kind of? I think I’d have to look at it again though… and honestly,” she sighs, “I really don’t like thinking about what happened to Rantaro—the entire thing was just too cruel.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was.” Kaede looks at the ground. “I think I’m going to go find Ryoma now, but thank you for your help, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” she says. “And I’ll keep looking to see if I can find anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in affirmation as she leaves. Ryoma’s leaning against the wall next to doorframe, and as soon as Kaede exits, he says, “it’s fine if you suspect me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips around, startled at the sound of his voice. “Oh! You’re… right there,” she says dumbly. “And you probably heard most of our conversation then, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” he says. “And I’ll say it again—I don’t care if you suspect me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I need to be suspicious of everyone,” Kaede answers diplomatically. “That’s the only way we can get through things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Ryoma says. “And I think we’ve wasted enough time—Kiibo’s avatar should be through here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He starts walking towards the door in the back, Kaede following after his tiny form. He swipes his card and looks at her almost challengingly as Kaede moves to do the same. She meets his gaze as evenly as she can, saying, “After you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He says, “Kiibo’s body is right on the other side—don’t trip over him on your way in,” and vanishes through the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits a few seconds to give him time to move away and takes a moment to steel herself be pressing forward. The darkness fades in, and it feels slightly longer than all the ones before it, but soon enough it vanishes again, and Kaede looks up to see a rather plain library around her and then down to see Kiibo’s unmoving avatar at her feet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She can’t help but let out a soft gasp at seeing him, and Ryoma says over her, “The only people in this room before Kiibo were Kaito and Kokichi. Thanks to Kaito, I got stuck searching the bedrooms by myself while they were supposed to investigate this place.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At his words, Kaede takes a moment to look up from Kiibo’s tiny, still body, and up at the room around her. The place is a near maze of haphazardly bookshelves that appear almost as if they were placed at random in the middle of the room and several ones rising all the way up to the ceiling line every wall, framing even the doorway. Kaede hesitantly walks around Kiibo’s body to inspect one of the shelves and sees titles identical to those of the books she had found in the church. She turns to another row, to see the exact same arrangement. The only things breaking up the monotony of books about how great Miu is are the occasionally placed golden statues of the girl in question.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, Ryoma says, “Honestly the number one thing this place tells us is just how big Miu’s ego is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can see that,” Kaede muses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma walks past her to another part of the rather awkward maze. “My guess is Kaito and Kokichi or maybe Kiibo and whoever killed him got into a fight over here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words catch Kaede’s attention, and she follows him to peer down the row where he stands. In it, several books have been ripped off their shelves to lie scattered about, as well as a few golden Miu statues. She walks down the aisle, trying to inspect it for any thing else out of place. “Our avatars don’t break,” Kaede says. “So I guess looking for injuries on Kiibo’s body is out of the question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would seem to be the case,” Ryoma answers absently.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede chooses to ignore the obvious lack of interest in his words as she continues on. “I wonder why if there was a fight, it’s only here, and not where Kiibo’s body is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess we’ll have to ask the culprit,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a breath and straightens her shoulders. “Hey, Ryoma,” she says. “I know you don’t care if I do have to suspect you during the trial, but for some reason, I’m starting to think you want me to think you murdered one of our friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Ryoma says dully. “Who else do you think did it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “Don’t try to change the subject.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not. Just asking a question,” he says. “Do you remember that last time we were in a library, talking about a murder, I asked Shuichi if he had a culprit in mind? Had no clue I was talking to a killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s hands clench into fists. “What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “A few things, I guess. You can’t just look at someone and know if they’re a murder—think that’s pretty important. But, also,” he looks at the ground as he reaches to pull his hat down. “Nothing’s changed. We’re still here, our friends are still dying, and all of our pointless suffering is still just for someone else’s amusement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She watches him intently for a moment before bodily turning away. “We need to investigate Kiibo’s murder. We can feel sorry for ourselves after everyone’s safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure,” Ryoma answers. “Just let me know when that is, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her tongue to stop herself from rising to his challenge as she approaches Kiibo’s avatar. She kneels next to it and notes that, like Ryoma said, it’s lying almost directly in the doorframe, as if he had just entered the room. The avatar itself is lying on its side as if he had just suddenly collapsed, and, though Kaede logically knows he must have been hurt somehow, there is a distinct lack of any external injuries. In the areas directly around his body, nothing seems amiss, and Kaede stands, moving to check the bookshelves on either side of his body, though those two seem untouched.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For a moment, she stands with her hands on her hips, rather frustrated at the complete lack of evidence. Then she remembers Kokichi and Tenko and Ryoma’s words, and takes a deep breath as she looks up. The bookshelves directly next to the door are almost unbelievably high, but, with a dawning horror, Kaede notices that the books lining one of the shelves are arranged in a slopping pattern—a pattern that would easily allow something round and heavy to roll along the tops of them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes dart to the ground again, and for a second she’s absolutely sure there has to be a bloody shotput somewhere around. But next to Kiibo’s body there is nothing. With her eyes still fixed on the ground, she says, “Ryoma—is there anything like a ladder around here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A what?” he asks, rounding the corner towards her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like a stepladder or just anything you could climb?” she asks. “Anything at all like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite all of his earlier aggression, Ryoma seems genuinely confused for a moment, as he says, “There’re some books stacked oddly in places—guess if you really wanted you could probably use them to climb or something. Might be possible with the rules of this world, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Stacking books to climb… that’d take a lot of time…” Her eyes dart back up to the horror above. “Could someone do that?” She scans the top of the shelf a bit more and makes note of the distinct lack of a vent like the one she had used so long ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her, Ryoma says, “Figure something out, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “Nothing. I didn’t find anything new.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “If you’re sure—you can look around more if you want, but I think that’s everything here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I’m done—let’s just go back for now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They head towards the door, and Kaede takes one more moment to look at Kiibo’s avatar, wondering how much she’s responsible for his death, too. Ryoma exits quickly once Kaede swipes her card after him, though her eyes remain locked on Kiibo as he exits. There are so many things she doesn’t know, but perhaps the biggest one is why anyone would choose to kill Kiibo of all people.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs again and exits the room. Tsumugi and Ryoma are standing in the hall, engaging each other in rather stiff small talk when Kaede enters. She does her best to put on a reasonably upbeat face, or—at the very least—a face that doesn’t betray the guilt threatening to eat her alive. “Tsumugi,” she says walking up to them. “Did you find anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually yes,” Tsumugi says. “Um, but I don’t think it can help us much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tell us anyway,” Kaede says. “Just in case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In that room,” Tsumugi says, pointing to one close to the library, “I found a used Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A what?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think it was a one time use only?” Tsumugi says. “But it was just lying under a blanket in one of the rooms. I tried turning it on, but nothing happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns, an odd look passing over his face. “So… wonder if that was our hint about the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it was here the whole time?” Kaede asks. “Did everyone searching here just miss it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Tsumugi says with a shake of her head. “This place is such a mess it’s kind of a lot to look through. I wish Miu made the program world a little tidier or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can’t be helped,” Ryoma says. “Now, is there anything else we need to check or can we get out of this place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can still check outside like I volunteered to do earlier,” Tsumugi says. “If everyone thinks it’s still necessary, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Go ahead,” Kaede says. “There’re a few things I still want to check on back in the school.” She turns to Ryoma. “Ryoma, is there anywhere you want to look around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks up at her, silent for a moment before saying, “I’ll go back to the school. There’s something I want to look into there as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright then,” Tsumugi says. “I have to admit being by myself in the program world is a little scary, but I’m sure I’ll be okay as long as someone’s watching over my body in the real world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We won’t let anything happen to you,” Kaede promises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They exit the basement and part ways at the top of the stairs with little fan fair. Tsumugi waves them goodbye as she goes to wander in the snow, and Kaede finds herself alone with Ryoma again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He says, “Kaede—think you’ve seen almost everything. So, you have a guess now who the culprit is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances down to him, refusing to take whatever bait he’s giving her. “Do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Pretty childish response, but, yeah, got a few people in mind.” He looks up at her. “You’re not one of them, by the way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That takes Kaede slightly off guard, and she says, “You… trust me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “After everything you’ve done for us, doubting you’s hard even for a guy like me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then earlier why were you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I trust you to find the truth,” Ryoma answers. “But I don’t believe for a second that you wouldn’t lie to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes, piecing his words together. “So I’m not the killer, but I am a liar. Is that what you’re saying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For the most part, yeah,” he says. “But,” his face darkens, “just because you can reveal the truth, doesn’t mean you should.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his cryptic words, Ryoma turns away from her, and Kaede doesn’t miss the fact that he enters the door to the salon without even glancing at the card reader. She follows after him, and on the other side, he’s already saying, “Ryoma Hoshi,” into the phone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s little Kaede can do other than sigh as she approaches the phone. She weighs it in her hands for a moment before saying her name, and the flash of light dutifully rises up around her before her world turns back to darkness.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The blackness engulfing her shifts to a plainer one, and this time Kaede doesn’t hesitate as she reaches up to pull her headset off of herself. Though she didn’t take a particularly long time to exit after him, Kaede notices Ryoma is already almost to the doors of the computer room as she blinks to clear her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The worlds finally swims back into focus as she hears the doors swing shut behind Ryoma, and then Tenko’s voice softly calling out, “Kaede? Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she answers, reaching up to rub at her eyes. “We just finished—well,” she glances towards Tsumugi. “Tsumugi said she’d stay in the program word for a little longer to try and see if she could find anything outside the mansion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Alright—Tenko will watch over her body to make sure nothing happens. Oh, but if you have a second, Tenko was also able to talk to the Monokubs a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede perks up at her words. “What did you find?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko asked the green one—she thinks it’s Monodam or something like that—about the card readers forcing everyone to travel in groups, and it said ‘something like that sounds like a great idea to help everyone get along.’”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede brings a hand up to fiddle with her hat. “Then Miu did lie,” she says. “I guess the question now is why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s one more thing that might be helpful,” Tenko says, and she points towards a computer in the back where Monotaro is sitting, his paws rapid fire hunt-pecking over the keyboard. “That one was referring to Kiibo as his father before and asked Tenko if he could do anything to help avenge him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at the odd sight. “So… what is he doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko was still trying to investigate the card readers, so she asked if he could find anything in the program’s code about them,” she says. “Tenko doesn’t really understand a lot about computers, but he said something about finding out their logs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Logs?’” Kaede echoes. “Were they recording something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “That’s Tenko’s guess, but,” she glances back to Monotaro. “She’ll ask when he’s done… however long that takes. Um,” she looks back to Kaede. “Is there anything else we need to check Kaede? Tenko needs to stay here, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is,” Kaede says. “I want to go talk to Kaito and Kokichi.” She sighs. “I don’t know if they’ll tell me the truth, but I need their testimonies.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says, looking to the ground. “Tenko… will watch over Tsumugi and read whatever the bear finds. Um,” she tries to smile. “Good luck, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says goodbye and walks out of the room, doing her best to keep her legs from giving out from under her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s far too thankful she doesn’t see anyone on the walk to the dorms, and Kaede takes a moment to straighten her shoulders and her hat before she knocks on Kaito’s door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a brief moment where she hears shuffling, then Kaito cracks the door open about a fraction. “Oh, Kaede,” he says opening it further. “Sorry—thought you were someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay?” Kaede says, attempting to look around him. “Is Kokichi there, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Kokichi’s voice call out, “Kaito played with me for the whole investigation!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nice to hear you two are getting along again,” Kaede says, not bothering to hide her skeptism.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs as he runs a hand through his hair. “Something like that—though if Kokichi makes me play one more game of fucking I Spy…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smiles. “Well, if I can interrupt your playdate, I have a few questions I’d like to ask you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright—also, uh,” he sighs again. “Sorry for acting so weird earlier. Something came up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you tell me what?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses, and Kokichi calls out, “Geeze, Kaede! Even though Kaito’s your friend, he doesn’t have to tell you everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “You admit you’re keeping secrets?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks up at her, face somber. “I fucking swear it has nothing to do with what happened to Kiibo.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I want to believe that,” she says. “So, can you tell me what happened then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says, nodding his head. “So first, Kokichi, me, and Ryoma went down to the basement, but there was a door in the back that would only let two people in, so Ryoma volunteered to stay behind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which was just as well!” Kokichi says, and Kaede hears his footsteps hurry towards the door before he peaks out at her from around Kaito. “Because Ryoma’s cool and all, but we was being such a third wheel.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “Shut the fuck up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “So the two of you went to the library by yourselves then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “We looked around there for a bit but found jack shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaito was really mean and wouldn’t even let me ride on his shoulders to check the higher shelves,” Kokichi adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did anything else happen?” Kaede persists. “Even if it seems small, it could be important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” Kokichi says brightly. “We just had a lovely time together, that’s all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “It was honestly just really boring to tell you the truth. Also Miu’s a huge fucking ego case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, so you just looked around?” Kaede asks. “And then you got logged out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yeah—no fucking clue why though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says. “And what happened after that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “Tenko tried to help me log back in, but then, uh,” he frowns. “Something came up that I had to deal with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already talked to Tenko,” Kaede says. “She said Maki—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I already took care of it,” he says quickly. “So it’s not a problem.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks at him, and he says, “Really.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t have to say anymore to know he’s not going to budge on this. She turns to Kokichi. “And what happened to you after that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he puts a finger to his chin. “First I was sad that my beloved Kaito disappeared, so I went back to other room to look for clues for a little while… and chatted with Ryoma. Then Kiibo and Tsumugi showed up—oh, and Kiibo had your ID, Kaede! Did he steal it from you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I just gave it to him and forgot to take it back, but that’s not what we’re talking about. Can you tell me what happened next?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow, Kaede, so many questions!” Kokichi says. “Almost like a real detective—I didn’t know you had two talen—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I asked you what happened next,” Kaede says tightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles back her. “I was bored of the library, but Kiibo wanted to explore it, so he and Ryoma went ahead. But then Ryoma came back super fast and told us something was wrong with Kiibo. We looked around for a while to try and get him to wake up, but then I said I heard Miu and everyone believed me for some reason, so we all went back upstairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns at him. “So you admit to lying to everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede already figured it out earlier,” he answers. “And besides, this was a helpful lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right…” Kaede says warily, looking to Kaito for confirmation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs in response. “Wasn’t there, but that’s probably what happened. At least none of it seemed weird to me. I mean, he could be lying—don’t know why he fucking would though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “My Kaito knows I only tell helpful lies, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks between them. “Well, I think that’s everything. Thanks for your help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito salutes her. “You got it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tries to smile back as nonchalantly as she can as Kaito shuts the door. She hears the two of them begin to argue over something inane, and she clenches her jaw, trying not to dwell on just how much their story conflicted with the one Ryoma had told her earlier.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When the doors to the school close behind her, Kaede resolves to take a brief trip to the bathroom to splash water on her face to calm every raging emotion threatening to overtake her before heading back to the computer room. She makes the walk in peace until she notices Maki standing alone outside the girls’ bathroom, leaning against the wall with her arms crossed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki?” she says. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Waiting for Miu,” Maki says. “She was working in her lab, and then suddenly shouted that she had to go to the bathroom. So,” she shrugs. “I’m waiting to force her to explain herself when she’s done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Has she been in there long?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Almost twenty minutes now,” Maki says. “Of course, I’m sure if I bring that up she’ll say something disgusting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… probably true,” Kaede says before shaking her head. “Anyway, Maki, I want to ask you something. Tenko said you logged out of the program ear—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” she says. “Is there a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede resists the urge to roll her eyes. “You really don’t need to withhold information from me for literally everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it’s not important to the trial,” Maki says. “Then I see no reason why I need to tell anyone what I was doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t stop herself from glaring. Then she says, “Tenko said she saw you watching Kokichi. What do you have to say about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d say she’s always had a wildly out of control imagination,” Maki says evenly. “Also, I understand the two of you are attached at the hip, but Tenko’s a rather poor choice for an investigation partner in my opinion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Maki, I really don’t care about your opinion,” Kaede replies. “And I have no idea why you think I do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face darkens, and she opens her mouth to speak when the door to the girls’ bathroom suddenly slams open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They both turn to see Miu framed in the doorway, her monopad held in one hand. Her eyes dart between them, and she says, “Can’t a girl fucking shit in peace?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Miu, were you able to figure out anything about what happened to Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu runs a hand through her hair. “Almost everything was fucking fried—nothing in his body would respond to any commands—honestly most of him is fucking scrap metal now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Poor Kiibo,” Kaede says, looking at the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“His main A.I. was shot to shit, too,” Miu says before breaking out into a bright, genuine smile. “So it’s a really good fucking thing I set his A.I. to back up earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You saved him!?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu turns the monopad towards them. “Check it out, baby—maybe his body’s gone, but Kiibs isn’t out of the game yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares intently at the screen and notices out of the corner of her eye that Maki does as well as it lights up. Then Kiibo’s face is blinking at them. “Kiibo,” Kaede breathes out. “Is that you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles. “Hello, Kaede and Maki! I am afraid my processes are limited now, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you know who killed you?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His smile falters. “I… was killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up at Miu in confusion. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I set him to back his A.I. up at midnight every night,” Miu says. “Which means,” she sighs, “this is a copy of Kiibo who doesn’t have any memories of what happened after that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he lives in your monopad,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did my fucking best!” Miu screams, not flinching even under Maki’s cold glare. “I fucking saved him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice calls out, “Miu, are you alright? Is something wrong—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “Everything’s fine—and the fucking trial’s cancelled now, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Oh. That’s actually a really good—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wrong!” says a voice behind them, and all three girls spin around to see Monokuma back from the dead behind them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s the first to recover, asking, “What do you mean ‘wrong?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean of course there’s going to be a trial!” he says. “Even if the victim isn’t dead, their body was discovered and a victim they remain—that’s why we could count a robot like Kiibo at all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede’s mind races. “Wait. We’re going to have a trial when there isn’t a victim!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There may not be a victim,” Monokuma says, bringing his paws to his mouth. “But there certainly was an attempt to graduate, and there certainly is a blackened among you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if Kiibo’s fine—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was still murdered,” Maki says. “Like Miu said,” she gestures towards the monopad. “This is just a copy. If you cloned someone after you killed them, you couldn’t just say that undid their death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you want someone else to die!?” Kaede shouts at her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please, ladies,” Monokuma says. “Save it for the class trial—speaking of which, I think it’s about time we get that ball rolling!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns back to him. “No, this is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A chime goes off to echo Monokuma’s words, and Kaede uselessly shouts over it, “He’s not dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma disappears in the midst of a fit of laughter, and Kaede distantly hears Kiibo say, “Was someone killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The entire time I was writing this chapter I was making "sometimes I can still hear his voice" jokes to myself. But, for the record as described, Kiibo is still officially dead, and isn't going to participate in a lot of things because of that. Also English V3 is out and that is great (even though I'm still on chapter 1)!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Another quick announcement is that hopefully I will be able to update next week, though I might not due to having some midterms coming up. If I am unable to update, I will instead start doing something I've been meaning to do for a while now, which is go back through this story from the beginning to generally edit typos, clean up language, etc., just to make it better overall!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki storms away, her hair whipping after her and trailing slightly aloft from the speed she moves at. Kaede can’t help but glare after her, curling her hands into fists, purely from her own frustration. She’s very aware how illogical and rude it would be to hope someone is the killer, as no one deserves Monokuma’s executions. But if the culprit has to be someone… Kaede shakes her head to rid herself of her guilt over her own horrid thoughts, and turns back to Miu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shifts awkwardly on the spot, gripping tightly onto her monopad—or, Kaede, supposes, Kiibo—as he says, “There’s going to be a trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede exchanges a look with Miu and lets out a sigh. “Someone… destroyed your body, Kiibo, and Monokuma’s counting it as a corpse,” she says. “Even if you’re fine, we still need to figure out who did this to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still need to fucking execute someone,” Miu mutters darkly under her breath.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip, pausing for a moment as Kiibo says, “I… see. I am afraid I will be of little help in the trial due to, ah, my current circumstances.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t need to solve your own fucking murder,” Miu says. “Bakamatsu’ll figure out who fucked you in the ass before you even finished installing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Finished installing?” Kaede echoes. “Is Kiibo—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu waves a hand. “He’s got a bunch more shit to run that takes longer to finish than some people around here if you know who I’m talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow at Miu’s specific turn of phrase as Kiibo interjects, “I believe Miu is referring to the fact that while I am able to speak to you now, there are several more parts of myself that are still be configured. Fortunately, it seems this software is strangely compatible with my own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” Kaede says. “I don’t really know a lot about computers, but that’s…” she looks up to Miu. “Actually that sounds really weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She just shrugs in response. “Don’t know what to fucking tell you—I thought it was gonna be actual hell, but it fit perfectly—nice and tight, with no—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Kaede says quickly. “Kiibo, if you need to… focus on installing yourself or something, it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Miu says, her enthusiasm surprising Kaede. “Make sure you’re at a hundred percent and all that shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo seems a bit confused as well, saying, “That is my goal, so I will try. Very well then,” he smiles. “I will attempt to join the trial after I have finished. However,” his smile falters. “If there is still time to bring this up, there is one issue that is troubling me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu frowns. “What? I didn’t fuck anything up—I checked like eighty million times to make sure it was right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is the only thing that that seems to be amiss,” he adds quickly, though remaining persistent in his train of thought. “Though all other parts of my A.I. seem to be functioning correctly thus far, given their limited spaces, I can no longer hear my inner voice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to respond to that question, and looks over him to Miu as she says, “Oh, um, is that not part of your programming, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only thing I backed up was the A.I. itself,” Miu says. “If God or your conscience or the fucking devil on your shoulder wasn’t part of that, then it’s shot to shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kiibo says. “That is rather unfortunate… but I suppose there is nothing that can be done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Miu’s bravado falters, and she mumbles, “S-Sorry, Kiibs… you—your inner something was really important to you, uh,” she suddenly begins to stammer, “I-I can look over your body and see if I can figure it out later! I’ll go over every part and work you all night until I find the special spot!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces, though Kiibo doesn’t appear to pick up the double meaning of her words, saying, “Thank you, Miu! After this trial, I’m sure you will sort everything out! I shall leave my hope with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah—” Miu stutters. “Y-Yeah, s-sure—I’m pretty fucking great, so, uh, I’ll help you out and shit after the stupid trial o-or whatever…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles. “Thank you, Miu. I will be counting on you then to look after me, and I will hopefully join you again later. Goodbye for now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, bye, Kiibs…” she says, her cheerfulness suddenly fading away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bye, Kiibo,” Kaede says. “Do your best to recover, and we’ll find out why this happened to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you, Kaede,” he says. “Well, is you’ll excuse me, I will be shutting down now until I am more fully operational. Please, do your best until then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles again at them, and then screen flickers for a second before turning off completely. Kaede blinks. “He can just turn himself off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “He can do a bunch of shit—like I said, I’ll keep an eye on how he’s doing during the trial, but I don’t think he’ll need any help if I set everything up right, and,” she tosses her hair over her shoulder, “since I am the great Miu Iruma, there’s no fucking doubt that he’s good to go—no need to think twice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t you say you checked a bunch of times first to make sure he was running, right?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well, you also can’t rush genius!” Miu spits back. “I mean, yeah, I could shat out better crap than you with my eyes closed, but there’s some shit you gotta finesse, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes, but can’t help smile. “And Kiibo’s wellbeing is one of those things you wanted to make sure you did right, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu freezes for a moment before moving to shove her monopad back into her pocket. “Shut the fuck up,” she tosses her hair over her shoulder. “As if a frigid virgin like you knows anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just shakes her head before looking the soberness of their situation fall back over her. “Anyway, while this is really good news, we still need to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know!” Miu snaps. “As if I don’t fucking know! Especially after all that crap everyone always says about finding justice, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I know. What we have to do next… there’s nothing just about it, not just because Kiibo’s alive, either.” She squeezes her eyes shut for a moment. “The trials have never been about justice or finding the truth—they’re just there to make us suffer. But,” she looks at Miu, trying to summon what little inspiration she has, “we still have to get through them, and I’m still going to uncover what happened here, for the good of everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu frowns, pulling at her hair, “I guess—long as my ass doesn’t get killed, I don’t really give a shit what you uncover…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Kaede falters. “I guess—oh!” she suddenly springs to attention. “I just remembered, I need to go check something with Tenko before the trial—ugh, I hope there’s enough time left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “You don’t have to fucking hold my hand on the way there. I can go to the goddamn trial myself—not like I don’t know where it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright then,” Kaede says, already beginning to jog away from her, “I’ll see you later then, Miu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu gives her a dull wave goodbye as Kaede starts sprinting back to the computer room, wondering just how much time she’ll have to go over what for all she knows might be the most important piece of evidence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s exiting the computer room with a long folded piece of paper in her hands as Kaede rounds the corner towards her. “Ah, Tenko!” she says, rushing up to her. “Did you and Tsumugi find anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi already left,” Tenko says. “And if she found anything, she did not tell Tenko, ah,” she looks back down at the paper in her hands. “Sorry, Kaede, Tenko was kind of distracted with this when Tsumugi logged out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko holds it out slightly to her, and Kaede leans closer to get a better look. She scans it briefly, noting the paper seems to be a list of names with a time and location written after each one. She randomly reads one aloud, choosing, “Maki Harukawa—5:56, entrance hall to salon.” She looks to Tenko. “Is this… a list of when we used the card readers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks so,” Tenko says. “She asked the bear, and it said this information was apparently being recorded and sent somewhere within the program world. Tenko doesn’t think it would lie, so this is probably trustworthy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can look it over to see if everything roughly matches up with how I remembered it, too,” Kaede says. “And I guess we really don’t have a choice in trusting if the information was being sent somewhere else since we can’t really prove or disprove it… especially since the investigation is over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, right,” Tenko says. “Um, Kaede, we can talk on the way, and you’d probably know more about what happened in the program, but Tenko thinks she found one thing that was sort of strange when she was reading it over earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods as they start walking together. “Really? What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She points to part of the list as they go, saying, “Tenko wasn’t really sure what to look for, so she just tried looking for things about Kiibo since… he’s the victim, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh!” Kaede says suddenly. “Tenko, I forgot to say, but Kiibo’s okay—Miu saved him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “She did!? Ah,” she smiles, pressing her hands with the list still in them to her heart. “Tenko is so happy Kiibo’s alright… Does this mean no one has to die now, too? No one has to be punished?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten. “Uh, no…” she looks at the ground as she walks. “When Miu told me, Monokuma appeared and announced we still had to do the trial, so,” she sighs. “Our lives are still on the line, and, if everything goes right, someone’s still going to be executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh…” Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko supposes Monokuma would do something like that… and one of us still at least tried to murder Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They did,” Kaede says, “but,” she looks back up to Tenko, trying to halt the sheer misery creeping over her. “Anyway, what did you say you found when you were reading the list?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko looks to it again, eyes quickly scanning over the rows and rows of text before she points to a specific section. “Tenko doesn’t really know what everyone was doing, so this could be nothing, but she noticed that after a certain point, it looks like Kiibo stopped using his card.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, here,” Tenko says, finger underlining a Kiibo’s name in one section. “This is the last time it seemed that Kiibo used his card anywhere except for the time Tenko used it in front of Ryoma and Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reads line Tenko’s pointing to aloud, “Kiibo—2:48, mansion front doors to outside… almost everyone else’s names are listed right before and after him, so I think that’s when we all left together to go to the church, but,” she frowns. “I definitely saw him using his ID later—he was with me and Miu after we split up, and I remember watching him use it to enter and exit the church.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, and shifts the list to find a different part. “Um, no,” she says as she points to a different section. “Tenko obviously wasn’t there, but you, Miu, and Kokichi went to the church.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede off guard enough that she physically stops in her tracks for a moment. “What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tenko walks over to her, showing off part of the list. “From what Tenko read, everyone else, not including Kiibo, went back to the mansion. Um,” she shifts nervously. “Does that help things make sense?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No—if anything this just creates another mystery.” She starts walking again. “Tenko, let’s also just be quiet about this until it seems right to bring it up. I have a pretty strong feeling the culprit probably knew about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko will not mention it until you do Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thank you,” she says. “Honestly, after talking to everyone, I think you might be the only person I can trust right now. So,” Kaede tries to give her best supportive smile. “We’ll just have to be a team—we’ll back each other up no matter what happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles. “Tenko will do everything she can, and no matter what, Tenko will believe in you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede feels her smile grow more genuine. “I believe in you, too. And,” she pumps her fists, “I believe we can get through this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They finish the walk towards the trial grounds, exchanging words of encouragement and further going over the log for information. Tenko’s observations can only do so much, though as Kaede takes it in, she notes plainly that according to its data, she was supposedly with Miu and Kokichi for most of her time in the virtual world. And again she thinks, <i>why does it always come back to him?</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone else is already gathered by the elevator, and Miu seems to be engaged in a rather heated argument with the others. As they approach, Kaede starts to ask, “What’s going—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede! Tenko!” Kaito shouts. “Did you hear? Kiibo’s fucking alive!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As alive as a robot can be!” Kokichi adds pleasantly. “Looks like Kiiboy lives to beep and boop another day—and that Miu isn’t a total waste of space!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu scowls. “Shut your fucking whore mouth,” she says, jabbing a finger at him as he grins up at her. “You spent the whole investigation sucking flowerbrain’s dick, and you’re giving me shit for being useful!? I’ll have you know the great Miu Iruma—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can we get this started already?” Maki says. “Miu’s given me enough of a headache already. The sooner I can stop having to hear her voice the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu wilts, stuttering, “I-I was j-just defending myself…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma ignores her, saying, “Have to agree—the sooner we get this over with the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “Our lives are still on the line, after all, so we probably shouldn’t dawdle, especially we can’t just save and reload if we need a break. Oh,” she hugs her arm, “this would be so much easier if we could just make a contract with Monokuma and rewind time, though that might only lead to more despair…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As I was saying,” Maki says. “My patience with listening to idiotic nonsense is already wearing dangerously thin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’ll threaten to kill us a bunch?” Kokichi asks. “Man, I wonder what it would be like if I tried using the same terrible answer for every problem I ever had.” He grins, folding his hands behind his head. “I bet I would be as interesting and unpredictable as you, Harumaki-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares. “Do you want to be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kokichi just smiles back, her answer speaking to his victory more than anything he could say would. Kaito steps between them, saying, “Maki—calm down—I get thinking Kokichi’s a fucking brat, but now’s really not the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “Our personal problems with each other aren’t important right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” asks Kokichi. “Is that so? Personally, I think that’s the only thing that’s important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede regards him warily as Ryoma asks, “And just what is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko steps forward. “Kokichi, Tenko will not tolerate anyone—especially a terrible boy like yourself—withholding information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guys,” Kaito says with a sigh. “Just ignore him for now—I’m sure he’ll say whatever cryptic bullshit’s important at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aww,” Kokichi says practically beaming up at him. “I can always count on my beloved Kaito to protect me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes in response. “Shut up—I’m not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki suddenly snaps. “Why do you always take his side?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He throws his hands in the air. “I’m not fucking taking sides—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are,” Maki insists, taking a step towards him. “And for some reason you always end up supporting him, even after all he’s done, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not true!” Kaito shouts. His sudden spike in volume casts a brief silence over them as everyone turns to stare with mixed looks of confusion and concern. And he falters, words catching up to his thoughts. “I mean—fuck,” he shakes his head. “Look I just… I just made a fucking mistake, and I’m dealing with it, and that’s really all anyone needs to know.” He turns to Maki and speaks only to her. “Okay, Harumaki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her glare doesn’t falter as her eyes flicker over him, and her pigtails snap violently as she jerks her head away from him saying, “Fine—be a hypocrite,” as she stomps towards the elevator.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He just sighs and looks at the ground, cursing under his breath. Kokichi hums, “Trouble in paradise?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think this is a little more than just that,” Tsumugi adds. “Usually conflicts in shoujo romance manga—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says gently. “I really don’t think now is the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “As if anyone gives a shit about dumb and fucking idiot’s sex life anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Talking about this is a waste of time,” Ryoma says, pointedly walking past her to the elevator. “If anyone has anything important to say, they can do it at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yep, yep!” Kokichi says cheerily, skipping after him. “I have a feeling this will be an extra fun one, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “How can anyone say something like that? But, ugh,” she starts to warily follow after him, “we really should get going…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says with a nod before glancing back over to Kaito, still looking down. She thinks almost absently that she would reach out in reassurance if she trusted him more. But as it stands, she says, “Hey, we have to go now—if you want to talk something over with Maki, you can do it later, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He swears again as he nods. “Yeah—yeah, I fucking know.” With another sigh, he looks up finally and walks past Kaede without a glance her way.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Alone with Tenko and Miu, the latter voices Kaede’s thoughts on their situation aloud, “What the fuck is wrong with everyone?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s been another murder,” Tenko says. “That is what is wrong with everyone, Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says, leading the way to the elevator with as much confidence as she can muster, even as she thinks <i>is that it?</i></span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The ride down is quiet, and Kaede notes that with only half of the people she promised she would save remaining, the tiny room feels so, so empty.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the trial room, Monokuma dutifully gives his explanation, his children butting in every so often to voice their surprise that their father is alive again. It all means very little to Kaede as she moves to her all too familiar podium. The entire thing feels so routine—so normal, and she sees Monokuma decorated Angie’s portrait with tiny angel wings and Kiibo’s with a perfectly uniform typeset X.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not her, and she’s decided to put faith in Tenko, and that’s where her belief ends. Before a word has even been said, Kaede rationalizes that at the very least, it’s a one in six shot of getting it right. Earlier she had realized it was a one in five guess of picking the mastermind, and as their numbers dwindle further and further, they have less people to hide behind. The more they play the game, the harder keeping their secret becomes. Of course, blindly murdering each other until they get it right is a lesson Kaede learned a long time ago.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But thinking of Rantaro makes her think of Kokichi’s warning, and she turns to him as he gets the first word in, “So first thing’s first,” he says, “the first person to find the body is always the most suspicious—so, Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has found almost every body so far,” Tenko says, voice firm. “She discovered Rantaro in the library, and Kirumi in the pool, and Gonta on the fourth floor.” She squeezes her eyes shut for a moment. “And now Kiibo in the computer room. The only thing that means is that Tenko has seen her friends’ corpses too many times.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, also,” Kaito says. “Me and Harumaki were right outside the door—I mean we were talking, but we probably would’ve heard if Tenko was doing any weird crap. Plus, when we came in, she was just kinda standing around confused before the body announcement went off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doing anything when someone’s getting it on right outside doesn’t seem possible, then, huh?” Miu adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clears her throat and Miu’s words away with a cough. “And, Tenko was also outside the program world the whole time—if she had wanted to do anything to any of us—which she didn’t—she could have done it at a much more convenient time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yeah,” Tsumugi says. “It would seem weird for the culprit to wait until witnesses are literally right outside the door to try anything, unless they had a magic notebook that could—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Maki says. “The Monokuma File said Kiibo suffered no external injuries, which we can probably take to mean that no one broke into his circuits from the outside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That sounds right, Miu,” she turns to the other girl. “You know the computer room pretty well—there aren’t any tools up there someone could use to dismantle Kiibo or remove any parts of him, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, it was fucking shit!” Miu says. “I had to get no-tits to carry him down to my lab since there was fuck all to repair him with up there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And when you were examining him, were there any signs that someone had tampered with him or injured him from the outside?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu rolls her eyes. “If there was, I would’ve already fucking said something, whale tits.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Alright—basically all that means, that whatever happened to Kiibo had nothing to do with Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that means it is impossible that Tenko is the culprit,” Tenko says. “And all of that is ignoring that Tenko would never harm Kiibo in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, duh,” Kokichi says easily. “I knew that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “And then you accused her because…? Did you think it would be funny to waste our time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi clicks his tongue. “Not a waste of time—I just think it’s really important we established that Tenko is innocent. After all,” he places a finger to his lips, “I think we need to know whose word we can trust before we move any further.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “And what is that supposed to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Simple,” he says, folding his hands behind his head. “Tenko is telling the truth—so any testimonies that conflict with hers must be lies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Would you like to provide more logic a four year old could figure out or can we actually move on with our lives?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says. “That Kokichi has a point—we were all really split up during the incident, so establishing a baseline for what has to be true might be a good idea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘What has to be…’” Kaito begins to say before frowning. “Kaede, are you saying that you think some of us—other than fucking Kokichi—are lying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyone who lies who isn’t the killer is only hurting themselves,” Tenko adds. “However… Tenko believes that might very well be the case—after what happened to Himiko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Blah, blah, blah,” Kokichi says. “As if we haven’t heard that story a million times. Point is,” he beams, “I just think we need to accept the fact that maybe more than just the killer has something to hide.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “What the fuck are you doing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles back at him. “Nothing, but, oh,” his smile darkens. “Did you assume I was talking about you, Kaito? Please, you know I would never betray my beloved—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Leave him alone,” Maki says sharply. “Kaito was with me when the murder happened—he has nothing to do with this. Questioning him would just be a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes dart between the three of them, not believing Maki’s declaration for a second. “Right… in that case,” she’s very aware how false her cheerfulness sounds when she asks, “Maki, would you mind telling everyone what you were doing before Kiibo’s death? I already asked Tsumugi, but she said she might remember wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares. “I was with Kaito. Tenko can confirm, and we all agreed to blindly trust her apparently.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not blind,” Kaede says. “We already went over all the reasons why it makes no sense for Tenko to be the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she could always be hiding something else,” Ryoma says. “Isn’t that what Kokichi just said? Someone other than the killer might be keeping secrets.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Keeping secrets when my ass is on the line,” Miu says. “Also,” her voice raises, “whoever the fuck you are thinking about yourself when Kiibs is the one we’re here for has a lot of fucking nerve.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi presses her hands to her heart. “Miu…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to her, squaring her shoulders. “That’s right. No matter what problems we have with each other, this is about Kiibo… and making sure we all live to another day.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma fiddles with his cigarette. “So it is,” he says dully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him, as Tenko haltingly adds, “S-So where would be a good place to start? Tenko only waited outside, so she doesn’t know what happened in the program world…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Far as I get it,” Kaito says, “whatever killed Kiibo happened to him in the program—if Tenko was watching his body the whole time, it seems pretty fucking unlikely anything happened to him on the outside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that means we can rule out Kaito, myself, and Tenko as suspects,” Maki says. “Obviously none of us had anything to do with this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-You can’t just make up a fucking alibi like that!” Miu shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why not?” Maki says. “It’s true—we already confirmed as much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well, fine!” Miu’s eyes dart around the room before landing on Kaede. “I was with boob-job the whole time—that means we have alibis, too, right Bakamatsu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “I guess, I mean,” she shakes her head. “Miu and I were together for basically the entire time once we entered the program.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Basically?” Ryoma says. “Which means…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we’d go through doors,” Kaede answers simply. “There would always be a brief moment we were apart, but that’s true for everyone in the program world because of how it was built.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s true, isn’t it,” Kokichi says. “And Kiiboy’s murder would take more than a few seconds to complete.” He glances to Kaede out of the corner of his eye. “Speaking of which, just how was he killed? Doing in a robot has to be a bit trickier than slicing up a meatbag.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Tenko says, frowning down at him. “You spent the entire investigation alone with Kaito, and you didn’t read the Monokuma File?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito quickly says, “No—we did, he’s just,” he coughs. “Just being an asshole or something, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oooookay,” Kokichi says, turning to him. “Soooo, Kaito, how do you think Kiiboy died?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Haven’t we already talked about this?” he asks. “Someone fucked with him in the program world?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s kind of vague…” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “Why are we bothering questioning him? Miu did an autopsy—ask her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Miu mostly just said that he suffered a shut down. I think the Monokuma File said it was sort of like if a person went into shock.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Miu says. “I already explained this to you, assholes—if you throw yourself off a fucking building in the program, your brain’s gonna think you just did that and freak the fuck out when you hit the ground.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” says Tsumugi. “So if you die in the game, you die in real life! Just like in that MMORPG that uses nerve gear! Although, that show’s really entry level…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito ignores her. “Yeah, and didn’t Miu say we could feel pain and shit, even if our avatars were indestructible?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And she also said we could die in the program,” Maki says. “It seems like someone decided to take advantage of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip as her she glances towards Kiibo’s portrait. Above almost everything else, she still wonders why someone would possibly go after him, of all people. But her chain of thought is cut short as Ryoma says, “doesn’t all this mean that we don’t know the cause of death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was killed in the program, sure,” he says. “But how his killer went about doing that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi cheers. “Is a mystery!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The details are,” Kaede says. “But, from what Miu’s told us, we can assume that he was probably killed… pretty normally.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” says Kokichi with absolute wonder. “So, so, so—was he stabbed, beaten, drowned, strangled, electro—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Ryoma snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “I… I was just trying to offer suggestions…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “How would Kiibo’s killer even do any of those things? Didn’t Miu say she removed everything dangerous?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe that was a lie,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu suddenly pales. “Wha—fuck—no!” she shouts. “I-I did remove everything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “Did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes!” she yells.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi continues to torment Miu, leveling a rapid fire volley of accusations at her, his list of possible weapons getting increasingly ridiculous as Kaede thinks. She hadn’t explored the entirety of the virtual world, and she knows Miu kept her secrets about many parts of it, but… was there anything dangerous?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, Miu!” Kokichi starts. “What did you leave in the program?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing!” Miu shouts back. “It was emptier than your pea sized skull!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Were there knives, or hammers, or saws?” Kokichi lists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki adds, “no one knew the virtual world better than you—you could have easily hidden something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or swords, or attack dogs, or wild bears?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo’s body was in the library,” Tsumugi says. “So if there was a weapon, it was probably in there…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or spears, or tasers, or poison?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When me and Kokichi were looking around the library,” Kaito adds. “I don’t remember seeing anything dangerous in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe they just used a pillow and smothered him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts, “For the last fucking time—there was nothing that could be used as a weapon! Do you think I’m an idiot!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “You’re really going to ask Kokichi that question?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “Kaito, that’s right! I remember during the investigation, it was really strange that there wasn’t anything that looked like it could have been a murder weapon in the library.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There wasn’t because I fucking took out all that shit!” Miu says. “Do you all get off on hearing me repeat myself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing in the library that could be a murder weapon,” Kokichi muses. “Is that right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course not,” Maki says. “It doesn’t matter how many times Miu says there were no weapons—Kiibo was obviously killed using something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at the ground, an odd expression on his face. “What if… we’re looking at this wrong? What if Kiibo wasn’t murdered?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “What are you talking about? He was killed—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He could have committed suicide,” Ryoma says suddenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth forms a thin, tight line. “We did talk about that possibility earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I remember that, but,” Tsumugi says, shaking her head. “I still don’t believe that possible. The laws of robotics wouldn’t allow it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “The fuck are the laws of robotics?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, well,” Kaede says, wary of Tsumugi rattling off another speech. “Basically they boil down to the idea that a robot wouldn’t purposefully harm itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if Kiibo follows the laws of robotics then him committing suicide is plainly impossible!” Tsumugi asserts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>No</i>,” Miu suddenly asserts, jabbing a finger at Tsumugi. “Kiibs committing suicide is impossible because he—” she cuts her self off, and her hand curls into a fist. “He just… fucking promised me we’d do shit when we got out of here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to her, “That’s right,” she says. “I remember him saying that, and it would be odd for him to do such a thing if he was intending to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What if he discovered something?” Maki says plainly. “Something that made him want to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Ryoma says lowly. “What are you trying to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What…” Tenko breathes out. “What could Kiibo—what could anyone have found that would have made them want to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses before turning away from them. “The reason we went into the virtual world in the first place was to find clues about the outside world, right? So maybe Kiibo found something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The clue to the outside world would make Kiibo kill himself?” Tenko asks, near horrified.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” Miu says, voice shaking. “That’s bullshit—that has to be bullshit! H-Hey! Titless, why the fuck are you lying to me about Kiibo!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually, Miu,” Kaede says. “I think the real question is why does Maki sound so sure about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks at her, expression unreadable. “Hey, Harumaki, if you know something you can tell us, okay? We know you’re not the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do we know that?” Kokichi asks darkly. “Because Maki was acting very strangely in the program world before Kiiboy’s murder, right, Tsumugi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi shoots a nervous look towards Maki. “That is true… Maki and I were supposed to investigate together, and then she suddenly left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s why you and Kiibo came down to the basement later,” Ryoma says. “It was just the two of you, and you were trying to meet up with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Tenko doesn’t know what Maki was doing in the program, but she just logged out though, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She left Tsumugi alone without a word to suddenly leave the program for no reason,” says Kokichi. “When you put it like that, Maki seems super-duper innocent, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she didn’t do anything,” Kaito says. “She logged out, and we spent the whole time talking—she has a fucking alibi, end of story.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, though seems rather unsure of herself as she says, “Kiibo was killed inside the virtual world, and Maki was definitely outside of it when that happened, so she has to be innocent…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says. “Not necessarily.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Maki asks darkly. “I was outside the pro—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kiiboy was in, but,” his smile twists into something cruel. “If you set a trap inside the program, you could kill him while you were on the outside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Trap?” Kaede echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “No—no that’s not possible. Harumaki was with us the whole—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She wasn’t,” Ryoma says. “She stayed back when we went to the roof, and Kokichi went outside.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks, and parrots perhaps the oddest part of that statement to Kaede. “Kokichi went outside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did!” he responds happily. “I went to go explore!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Again Tenko says, “Kokichi went outside when everyone else went to the roof…” she furrows her brow. “Uh—um, K-Kaede told Tenko this happened pretty early on when everyone entered the program…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow, all too aware she’s lying, as she backs up her story, “That’s right—is there something wrong with that, though?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns again, looking down in confusion as she says, “Did Kokichi actually go outside?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks up at her, mild curiosity on his face before he says, “You’re making an interesting point, Tenko, but we should talk about that later—now’s not the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?” Miu asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means, now’s the time to grill Maki until she confesses!” he says. “Duh!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t kill Kiibo,” Maki says dully. “Being alone for five seconds doesn’t change that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaito says. “And I’ll say it a hundred times if I have to—the fact that she was outside of the program has nothing to do with Kiibo! I believe in Harumaki, and I believe she would never just try to kill someone to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him an odd look. “That’s right,” she says, even as her tone holds almost no confidence in her words. “I wouldn’t do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what were you doing outside of the program?” Miu asks. “Did you log out just to get freaky with spacecase?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki jerks her head towards her. “Do you want me to kill you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu retreats, as Kaede bites her lip, going over the possibilities before her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko can confirm that Maki was logged out of the program when Kiibo died,” Tenko says. “However, she did not tell Tenko why…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She did it on purpose,” Kokichi adds. “So it wasn’t a weird, freak thing like what happened with Kaito.” His face darkens. “It was a premeditated act to carry out her evil plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “I didn’t have an ‘evil plan.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you can tell us what you were doing,” Kokichi insists. “If you have nothing to hide, you’ll tell us, right Harumaki-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says. “Leave her alone—she told me what she was doing, and it’s nothing strange.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you tell us what it was, dickhead!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko adds in a softer voice, “Kaito didn’t tell Tenko what he was doing outside the program either…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kaede says. “You just said Maki told you why she logged out, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He frowns. “Yeah… it’s what we were talking about, but it’s really not a prob—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you knew she was trying to kill Kokichi,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A harsh silence falls over the room, and Kaito just stares at her, struck dumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His speechlessness is enough to confirm her suspicious, and Kaede presses forward. “Tenko told me that she sensed a killing intent coming from Maki when she logged out, and that it was directed towards Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know anything,” Maki snaps. “There’s no reason to believe—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s the only person I can believe,” Kaede says. “And we agreed we’d trust in her word.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “She’s an overly emotional idiot who—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows what she felt,” she says coldly. “Maybe her emotions haven’t been as clear lately, but she knows what happened, and—and,” her voice twists into something angry, “and how <i>dare</i> you tell Tenko that she doesn’t know her own feelings.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d put faith in Tenko’s ability to read emotions before almost anything else,” Kaede says. “And if she says that she sensed you were attempting to kill Kokichi, then I believe her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that <i>is</i> what Tenko felt,” Tenko says. “There is no doubt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, obviously I didn’t kill Kokichi,” Maki spits back. “So you can stop with your meaningless deductions. If you think you’re cornering me into anything, you’re delusional.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, wait,” Tsumugi says, shooting increasingly fearful glances towards Maki. “I have a question—if Maki left the program world because she intended to… to kill Kokichi, does that mean she was planning to fight Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, seemingly undisturbed by the revelations floating around him as he rocks on his heels. “Oooh, that would be something—a duel between Maki and Tenko, especially since Maki herself said it would be silly to try such a thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She did,” Ryoma says. “Which I suppose is just more evidence that she was thinking about it from the get-go. If it matters,” he fiddles with his cigarette, staring intently at it rather than anyone hanging on his words, “Tenko’s been skipping meals lately, meaning she’s been undernourished and low on energy—if Maki was planning to fight her, now would be the best time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands on the air. “What kind of bullshit deduction is that!? There’s no way Harumaki was tracking something like that! And,” he slams his hands down on the front of his podium. “In case you’ve all fucking forgotten, the victim is Kiibo—maybe Harumaki was thinking about doing something for, like, five seconds, but that doesn’t mean she’s the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him and finds herself feeling frustrated over everything else. “So you don’t deny that she was planning to kill. Is that what you two were talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That would explain why they did not want Tenko to hear,” Tenko adds. “And also… it is a possible explanation for why Kaito agreed to protect Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s smile isn’t bright or childish like the one Kaede has seen him wear in the face of horror so many times before. Instead, if Kaede didn’t know better, she’d almost label it as melancholy or, perhaps, remorseful. He says, “That certainly is one possibility. Kaito protected me to protect Maki. It’s almost funny how much Maki needs to be saved from herself. I wonder what would happen if she didn’t have Kaito around to tell her what to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a look of pure death. “I can still kill you, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “But you won’t as long as Kaito’s around. Because what happened,” he smiles, “is that Maki logged out of the program to come after me, but stopped when she saw Kaito who scolded her and hit her on the nose with a newspaper until she calmed down. The end!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ha!” Miu suddenly blurts out. “Guess Whore-ukawa really is spacecase’s bitch!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I can kill you, too,” Maki says darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eeeeey!” Miu shrieks. “I-I w-was just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shutting up,” Maki says. “If you want to keep all of your limbs, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s the end of this!” Kaito shouts. “Harumaki almost did something, but she didn’t, and she’s not fucking responsible for what happened!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at him, and she asks as evenly as she can, “Why did she try to kill Kokichi? You know the answer to that, too, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks at her, clenching his jaw. He pauses too long, before finally saying, “reason doesn’t matter. And…” his eyes dart to Maki and then pointedly away again. “And she promised not to try anything again, so none of this matters.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s one problem I have with just dismissing Maki as suspicious,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head, muttering under his breath. “Fucking hell… She didn’t do it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki had the keycard to access the motive,” Ryoma says plainly. “Far as we know, she’s the only one who could have seen it. Even if she wasn’t acting sketchy, that alone should be enough to make her a suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Kaede says. “Maki did—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki answers. “The motive doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone’s a liar,” Kokichi says in a sing-song voice. “So, real question: when did you look at the motive? Ooh, ooh! And how super cool was it that it caused you to murder Kiiboy in cold blood?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls. “The motive is stupid, and I never even saw Kiibo in the simulation after we split up.” She crosses her arms. “My brief intentions to end your miserable existence and stop this game had nothing to do with Kiibo’s murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “‘Stop this game?’ Maki… do you think Kokichi is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito cuts in, “He’s not, and it doesn’t matter. So let’s just fucking talk about something else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to him as she fiddles with her hat. Attempting to convince him to stop protecting Maki is likely a lost cause, especially since the girl in question being a generally suspicious person and Kaede’s own distaste for her are rather removed from being concrete evidence. And, of course, how Kiibo factors into anything described is far, far out of reach of any logic Kaede finds herself able to throw together at the moment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s still staring at her, eyes silently pleading, as Kaede finally says, “Fine—there’s more to discuss anyway. So,” she sighs and turns back to face the group as a whole. “Does anyone else have a question—it might jumpstart a new conversation.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, I’ve fucking got a question,” Miu says. “The hell does flat-chest mcstabby get off on saying Kiibs found something that would have made him commit suicide?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s right!” Tsumugi says. “Earlier, Maki was really confident when she brought up that possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “It was simply a theory—don’t put too much stock into it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We should still think about it,” Ryoma says with a sigh. “And another thing to consider: the whole damn reason we went into the virtual world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The clues about the outside world, and something that would cause Kiibo to take his own life,” Kaede says. “Do you think there’s a connection between those two things, too, Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To the ground he says, “Just saying no one here’s spoken up about finding what we were looking for, and also no one else ended up dead while everyone had an alibi.” He shrugs. “Maybe my logic’s out of order, but it just makes sense to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Ryoma isn’t fighting particularly hard for his argument, Kaede finds herself furrowing her brow as she thinks over his words and all the testimonies she had heard before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the program,” Tsumugi says hesitantly. “Did Kiibo find the secret of the outside world? And then… did he decide he didn’t want to live anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bullshit!” Miu shouts. “Kiibs’s a team player—he woulda fucking said something if he found it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would anyone here keep something that important secret?” Kaito asks. “It’s the whole fucking reason we went into Miu’s shitty world in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi chirps, “I dunno—would anyone here possibly do something that devious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Question fucking retracted,” Kaito says completely deadpan.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But even if someone did find it,” Tsumugi says. “What were we even looking for? Do we have any idea what the clue to the outside world even is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We should ask Maki!” Kokichi says. “She found it, after all! Right before she killed Kiiboy, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there a rule against committing murder at a class trial?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sounds almost tired as he says, “No one’s fucking killing anyone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, Tsumugi,” Kaede says. “I think we did find the clue to the outside world earlier. Do you remember? There was a Flashback Light in the basement, though it seemed like it had already been used when we tried to turn it on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s right,” Tsumugi says. “But I guess that means that someone did really just find it and keep it a secret, though I don’t know why anyone would do that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be what Maki was talking about earlier,” Ryoma says. “Maybe it’s a truth we’re better off not knowing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with the brim of her hat, choosing her words carefully before saying, “Even if that is the case—which I hope it’s not—this might be a pretty important clue to discover what happened to Kiibo, especially since it’s clear someone used it but is keeping quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snaps her fingers. “So all we need to do is figure out who used the Fleshback Light, and then vote for their ass!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Makes sense to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh—hey, wait,” Kaito says suddenly. “I’m not gonna try and say that the Flashback Light or whatever isn’t related, but couldn’t this be some of that shit Kokichi was talking about earlier? Like people just lying or hiding crap for different reasons?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko voices aloud the accusation rolling through Kaede’s head. “Kaito… that sounds very suspicious. Did you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “I’m just thinking about it—can’t a guy fucking throw out theories without being accused of murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not at a class trial, my dear Kaito,” Kokichi answers. “Here, everything you say can and should be used against you because one of us isn’t trying to find the culprit, or perhaps,” his smile stretches to almost split his face in half, “in this case, more than one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“More than one of us?” Kaede echoes. “Kokichi, you’re saying there’s someone else here besides the killer who wants us to get it wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He presses a finger to his lips. “Of course,” he answers. “Would I lie to you guys?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You always say that right before lying,” Maki says. “And,” like a light switch, her face flickers from banal to something predatory. “Why don’t you tell us exactly what your alibi is since you seem so intent on talking down to us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi taps a finger to his chin. “Me? Why do I need an alibi? I’m as innocent as can be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not an answer…” Tsumugi mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As far as Tenko understands it from what Kaede told her,” she says. “After Kaito’s strange log out, Kokichi was left alone in the program world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So I was!” he answers cheerily before suddenly descending into sniffles. “Seeing my beloved Kaito just vanish before my eyes… whoever made him disappear is so mean!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Can’t say when Kaito left, but Kokichi did come back out of the library alone.” He lowers his hat. “That also means he was at the scene of the crime by himself—and we don’t know how long for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I get it,” Miu snarls, jabbing a finger in Kokichi’s direction. “After closet case fucked off, that little abortion sabotaged the library to kill Kiibo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, hey,” Kaito cuts in. “Just saying Kokichi sabotaged some crap is pretty fucking vague, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares. “Why are you defending him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a good question, Maki!” Kokichi cheers. “Why is Kaito helping me out? Could it be that he believes in—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kaito says suddenly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His answer manages to catch both of them off guard, and Kokichi and Maki ask, “What?” at the same time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Kaito, what do you mean? Do you trust Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought you two wanted to rip each other’s heads off?” Miu says. “D-Did one night of passion really turn things around that much!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a sigh as he runs a hand through his hair. Before anything else, he breathes out, “Shut up, Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Hey! I only—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kokichi says sweetly. “Kaito asked you to keep your filthy mouth shut, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She falters again and begins to mumble more excuses to herself as Maki says, “Kaito—you’re going to explain yourself to me right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses again before shaking his head. “Don’t get me wrong—Kokichi’s still a fucking asshole, but… I’ve decided he’s not our enemy, and I’m gonna believe in him. And, if that screws us over, then it’s no one’s fault but my own, but right now it’s the only thing I can do. So,” he looks up with something close to renewed determination. “For now, I’m gonna believe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And perhaps the strangest thing is how unsurprised Kokichi suddenly seems. “Can’t say I ever remember a time when someone decided to say something like that to a liar like me, but,” he grins. “I guess it makes sense given Kaito’s position. And,” he flickers back to his cheery, sing-song voice, “It looks like my Kaito really is a standup kinda guy! At least, when he’s able to stand up that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s hands tighten into fists. “If you’re blackmailing him, I will kill you right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki, it’s fine,” Kaito says trying to smile at her. “I wouldn’t be much of a man if I couldn’t handle my own mistakes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Nothing about his words seem console her, and Maki responds in the same tight voice. “Why are you acting this way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, Harumaki-chan,” Kokichi says. “You and Kaito are pretty good friends, and not even the best of friends tell each other every—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is a class trial,” Ryoma intones coldly. “If we need to interrogate Kaito, we will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we don’t,” Maki says. “So this conversation is over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her shoulders as she prepares to cut in. “Actually, it’s not because Kaito and Kokichi are both still really suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Kaede, if you’re saying that because I disappeared or whatever, I already told you I have no idea why the fuck that happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I believe that,” she says. “Tenko basically confirmed as much for me during the investigation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Tenko says. “When Tenko went to help Kaito, he seemed to almost be in a panic about getting back into the program. Tenko does not think he was just acting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I had no idea what the fuck was going on!” he announces. “If anything that just makes me less suspicious, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi quietly adds, “I… don’t think that makes sense…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that’s not my point,” Kaede says. “My point is that you and Kokichi were the only people in the library before Kiibo arrived and was killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s just a coincidence,” Kaito says. “And Kaede—what the hell is with this?” There’s something almost hurt in his expression that makes Kaede’s throat tighten even as she refuses to back down. “Do you… do you really think I did it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t have to answer any of her questions,” Maki says. “You don’t need to tell anyone anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “If Kaede doubts me she should clear her doubts, but, fuck…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede does let her gaze falter to stare at a place slightly to the side of his face then. “There’s really just one thing that’s been bothering me, but… as soon as I get an answer to that, I can decide for sure whether or not to suspect you. I,” she hugs her arm. “I am sorry for this, Kaito, I do want to believe in you, but…” and Kaede stops herself from saying just how little she trusts perhaps the first person to have faith in her since Shuichi died.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But for as nice and supportive as Kaito has been since the very beginning, Kaede can’t look at him without doubt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kokichi suddenly cuts through her thoughts, saying, “Kaito’s not a killer, but let’s hear what Kaede has to say. I have a feeling it will be important as we move forward towards a real suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snorts. “Sticking up for your fuck buddy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi practically twirls around. “Of course! If Kaito believes in me, then I’ll believe in him—I’m all about paying people back, you know. Soooo,” he turns to Kaede. “Give me your best shot, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Isn’t Kaito the one who should be arguing?” as the room then devolves into chatter, and Kaede knows that now is the time to finally catch someone in their lie.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m a suspect,” Kaito says. “Because I was in the library with Kokichi before the murder, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That means Kokichi’s a suspect, too,” Maki adds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts, “You fucking tried to kill the shota—sit your ass down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re suspect buddies because no one else was in the library before Kiiboy,” Kokichi says. “Buuut, neither of us were there when he actually died, soooo…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks maybe one of them could have set a trap or something,” she says. “But it’s hard to believe two people—even if it’s two boys—would work together to kill someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The two of them were alone for a while,” Ryoma says. “So if that is what happened, they had the time and opportunity to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, well,” Kaito says. “We didn’t do anything in the library besides talk and look for clues or whatever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi adds, “I did find the Flashback Light in the room next to the library, so… I actually don’t know if that supports if they’re innocent or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gasps. “The Flashback Light was right in the next room!? Aw, boo! And we spent so long looking for it, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scoffs. “Boys might be terrible at paying attention, but were you even listening? We already discussed that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” he says. “So we did!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Kaito—you said you and Kokichi didn’t do anything in the library besides talk, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he answers. “I told you that during the investigation, too, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You did,” she says. “And it bothered me then because… it just doesn’t match with the scene of the crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns, and Kaede swears she sees him start to sweat. “Okay, so maybe the room was a little messed up—that’s just what you do when you’re looking for shit, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “It looked like there had been a fight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then Kiibo fought with his killer,” Maki snaps. “That’s the most obvious—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo was alone in the library for seconds at most,” Kaede says. “Ryoma, Kokichi, and Tsumugi can all confirm that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “Ryoma followed after him, but he came back very shortly afterwards… it probably wouldn’t have been enough time to have a fight, especially in a place so far away from the body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki spits, “Kiibo wasn’t even there.” She turns her glare on Kaede. “Even if there was a fight, it has nothing to do with the murder—all of this is irrelevant.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true…” Tenko says. “If Kiibo was not there, then what would they have been doing to make the crime scene look like there had been a fight?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu cackles, “Well I can tell you what they <i>weren’t</i> doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just stares blankly for a moment before folding his arms behind his head. “You know, I actually think Maki is right. None of this is really important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would like to believe that,” Kaede says. “But the fact that it happened in the room where Kiibo was attacked just can’t be a coincidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bzzt!” Kokichi says. “Wrong! It is just a coincidence—now back to Kiiboy—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know you’re just going to lie,” Kaede says. “But there’s obviously a secret here, and if you want me to drop it, I’m going to have to hear it from Kaito. So,” she turns to Kaito to see him gripping the front of his podium and looking at the ground. “I don’t want to think you’d hurt Kiibo, but you have to tell me now why you’ve been acting the way you have. What happened in the library and why did—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaito’s head snaps up as he says, “I tried to kill Kokichi,” so fast Kaede thinks she dreamed the words for a second.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Absolute silence falls over the room, and Kaede can only stare at him in shock.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a shaky breath as everyone collectively fails to take in his confession. Kaede barely hears Kokichi say very softly, and mostly to himself, “you didn’t need to tell them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But he keeps going, showing Kaede the truth she had been pushing so hard for. “It was fucking stupid, and I barely did anything, and I regretted it immediately, and it ended with Kokichi fucking feeling sorry for me,” he says, voice labored with deep a self-hatred Kaede never could have imagined him possessing. “The only thing that happened is I knocked some books off the shelf like an idiot and shoved Kokichi against a different shelf before he talked me down…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head, trying to possibly process what she’s hearing. “Is—is that tru—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” Maki suddenly asks. “Why are you telling them anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks at her. “Harumaki, wha—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just shut up,” she says. “Just shut up and stop making things worse for yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito lets out a humorless laugh. “The hell are you trying to protect a hypocrite like me for? After all the crap I said to you, you should be more pissed off at me than anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares hard at him for a moment, before turning away sharply. Kaede watches her then turns to Kokichi only a trial stand away to see him just staring forward almost vacantly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows before she decides to ask her own question, “But why? Why would you do something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He goes silent again, and Kaede thinks he isn’t going to answer at all when he finally says, “I thought… I thought he was the mastermind. After everything Harumaki said, and everything we talked about I felt I had to, but… I still couldn’t go through with it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their conversations that had stretched on and on about saving everyone run through Kaede’s head as she just stares at him, and the question <i>did I talk someone into murder?</i> burns bright and painfully in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kokichi says coldly, “Kaito’s not a killer. And none of this,” he looks directly at Kaede. “Has anything to do with Kiiboy’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside him, Tenko hesitantly asks, “H-How can you be so certain?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because Kiiboy barely has anything to do with Kiiboy’s death,” Kokichi answers plainly. “Because the real truth behind this case is that almost everyone here is capable of murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And chapter 4 trial has begun! I want to take a moment also here to give a huge thanks to everyone who has been commenting and say that even if I don't reply to every comment (especially lately since I've been kinda pressed for time between school work and writing this fic, haha) know that I read and adore every single one!

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s words seem to almost cast a spell over them. Or perhaps it’s Kaito’s confession or Maki’s seething rage ready to bite the head off of anyone who says another word against them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No matter the cause, however, Kaede finds herself gripping the edges of her podium as the implications of everything she strove to unveil comes rushing up to her. Before his death, Shuichi had told her why he was so afraid of the truth—why he had allowed himself to die rather than facing it again. Kaede had understood his fears only from a distance, but now they surround her, asking if she’s proud of herself and everything she’s accomplished by dragging out someone’s secrets into the light.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s too caught up in thinking how all of this, everything about this entire case, about the entire game, is her fault to say anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Miu shouts, “As if you <i>fucking</i> know anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede snaps her head up to see Miu practically trembling with anger on the other side of the room. “Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi says, sparing Miu a glance. “Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said shut the fuck up!” she screams. “I said—” she leans forward over her podium, thrusting a finger in his direction, absolute fury in her eyes, “That you don’t fucking know anything about Kiibo, you miserable little prick!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Miu,” Tsumugi says. “Do you know something about Kiibo’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls and casts a pointed glare over Kokichi, Maki, and Kaito in turn before huffing and crossing her arms. “I know the three stooges apparently all have egos bigger than my tits if they’re trying to make Kiibs fucking <i>dying</i> about themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re saying their testimonies aren’t important?” Ryoma questions.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m saying,” Miu begins. “I don’t fucking feel like taking the time to throw the twunk-wannabe a pity party when someone here tried to kill Kiibo.” She tosses her hair over her shoulder. “I get that you’re all brainless enough to buy into the crap horseshit says about Kiibs not counting as a person, but if you think he didn’t matter at all, then, then—” she gestures wildly, obviously trying to think of an appropriate threat, “Then I’ll fucking lick you until you cry!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “That would be… pretty gross…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Tenko does not know what Kokichi truly meant, but… Tenko also believes that acting like Kiibo did not matter to fight amongst each other…” she shakes her head. “Tenko is tired of people saying her friends’ deaths don’t matter, and she refuses to let it happen to anyone else!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi raises an eyebrow at her, contemplating the situation rather distantly as he says, “Your platitude are nice and all, and, well,” he grins, folding his arms behind his head. “If you want to ignore my help and go off on the wrong track, who am I to stop you? Soooo,” he beams, “have lots of fun!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I thought I told you to shut your fucking mouth!” Miu shouts. “The next time you even think about saying Kiibs was just a useless robot, and everything’s just about your threesome fuckbuddies, I’m gonna stomp over there and kick your fucking teeth in!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts sniffling. “Why are you being so mean to me? I already said you could just do whatever you want… and I’ve already been through so much today with people trying to kill me, a-and, and,” his sniffling escalates into ear shatteringly loud sobs, “Waahhhh! Miu’s a bully!!!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Yet at her words, Kaito sighs and returns to staring at the ground, seemingly too ashamed of himself to argue. To the floor he says, “But… Miu’s got a fucking point—I did a lot of stupid shit, but this isn’t about me or Harumaki or Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi could still be the culprit,” Maki says sharply.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oooh,” Kokichi says, suddenly cheerful again. “Could I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Why do you sound excited about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Kokichi’s not the culprit.” He runs a hand over his face. “Haven’t we already been over this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “If anything, someone’s been steering us away from it.” He shakes his head. “Guess it makes sense why Kaito’s been protecting him now though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu points an accusatory finger at him. “You were gonna try and guilt us into the wrong vote just so your fucking boytoy could get away with murdering Kiibs!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “I take it back—Miu doesn’t know what the fuck she’s talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then allow me to clarify,” Maki says. “Kaito’s not the culprit—that much is obvious, but Kokichi’s still suspicious since he was in the library by himself after Kaito got logged out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says, sounding almost completely exhausted. “I get why you’re accusing him, but just trust me, okay?” he sighs again. “It’s not Kokichi—he talks a lot of shit, but he’d never actually do anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have any proof of that?” Ryoma asks. “Or is this just a hunch?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Neither,” he says. “Maybe I didn’t investigate so I don’t have evidence, but I already said I believe in Kokichi, and after the shit I pulled, I’m not going to just fucking go back on that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it is out of guilt,” Tenko says softly, eyes not so subtly darting down to Kokichi standing vacantly beside her. “Kaito—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t call me an idiot and don’t fucking tell me I’m wrong,” Kaito snaps. “I get it if you guys can’t trust me, but I’m not backing down on this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. Kokichi and Maki are both silent, and she knows that if they possibly want to move the conversation forward, it has to be her. “Then let’s stop just accusing each other,” Kaede says, “and actually try and figure out one of the puzzles surrounding Kiibo’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her suggestion is briefly meant with silence—though not a hostile one—before Ryoma says, “and which puzzle do you suggest we start with?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Kaede,” Tenko says. “If you do not mind, Tenko has a question that’s been bothering her for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, fairly certain Tenko is one of the few people who will not immediately turn the conversation back to finger pointing. “Alright, what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” she says, “We’ve talked a lot about how Kaito was strangely logged out of the program world, but Tenko doesn’t think we’ve actually established how that happened.” She bites her lip. “Tenko just thinks it’s very strange because she didn’t see anything physically happen to him on the outside beforehand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “I’d actually like to know the answer to that as well. Maybe his synchronization score was so low that the program wouldn’t respond to him at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know about that,” Kaede says. “But this does seem like a good place to start.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Yeah—hate to say this, ‘cause I wanna know what the fuck happened, but there’s not much I can tell you that we haven’t gone over already in… detail, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi finally speaks up saying, “Me and Kaito were chatting, and then a shiny circle appeared around his feet like when you log out at the phone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But can we really trust either of you?” Ryoma says. “After everything we’ve talked about, it’s pretty safe to say they could just be lying for each other—maybe Kaito did it on purpose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Tenko doubts it—Kaito was pretty panicked, and also Tenko doesn’t think he would even know enough about computers to do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito shouts. “I know shit about technology and crap! Just not Miu’s stupid program!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m pretty sure it was someone else that caused Kaito to get logged out,” Kaede says. “And I think I have a theory about what happened, too, and if I’m right about this, it should hopefully clear him of all suspicion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then get on with it,” Maki says. “Are you trying to impress us by dragging everything out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Harumaki—let her talk. After all,” he laughs humorlessly. “I’ve got nothing left to hide.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses before saying to Kaede, “Fine—just don’t screw it up, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she fiddles with the brim of Shuichi’s hat. “I don’t intend to, Maki—all I want is to find the truth behind this case and end things as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then hurry up already if you’re so sure you have the answer,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely resists rolling her eyes as she takes a breath instead to center herself and listen to the others talking around her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko still isn’t sure,” Tenko says, “why Kaito was logged out of the program world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe there was a glitch,” Maki says. “It was just a coincidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But the timing was strange,” Ryoma says. “Kaito logged out right before Maki, right? There’s a chance they were planning something together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Kokichi says. “No chance!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi adds, “I was in the entrance hall after Maki logged out, and I didn’t see anyone go past. Ryoma and Kokichi were also down in the basement, so I plainly doubt that Kaito could have just walked to the phone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And also the fact that I keep saying that I never fucking went to the salon,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well,” Miu says. “The phone’s the only fucking way out of the program, so obviously dickless had to have used it to get out! A-And that is the only possibility!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stage whispers, “Kaede, someone’s lying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“M-Maybe he hacked the system from the inside!” Miu says quickly. “O-Obviously it had to be something like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze,” Kokichi says. “I wonder what it could be…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s already sweating when Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose and says, “Miu, you already told me yourself that you can veto people logging out of the program world from inside of it. You’re going to have to give me a very good explanation if you want me to believe you really have no idea what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well,” Miu stutters. “S-See—sh-shit’s fucking complicated, y’know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at her. “So it was you! What the fuck, Miu?!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Of course—it’s so obvious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kokichi says. “If it was so obvious, why didn’t you say so earlier, Harumaki-chan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls, her eyes practically glowing. “I see—you and Miu want to die, is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko speaks up, “Tenko thinks we should let Miu explain herself before we move on to discuss anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to hear her reasons, too,” Ryoma says. “And also how she even did something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s eyes dart between her accusers, her earlier, angry, confidence, fading fast. “W-What are you virgins talking about? I-I never said any of that crap! Whatever shit Bakamatsu’s saying is obviously as fake as her tits!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s the argument you’re going with?” Tsumugi asks. “But why would Kaede lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t fucking know!” Miu shouts, throwing her hands in the air. “Maybe she’s the killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares. “Miu, we were together literally the entire time—it’s impossible for me to be the killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-And that means it’s also impossible for me to have done any of the crap you’re accusing me of!” she shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ve had enough of this nonsense,” Maki says. “I think it’s safe to say Miu is somehow responsible for logging Kaito out of the program, but I also doubt she’s the killer—does anyone here actually think Miu, of all people, could convincingly lie long enough to last in a trial without breaking down?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko adds, “Tenko also does not believe that Miu would harm Kiibo—perhaps it is naïve, but Tenko believes that alone is enough to dismiss her of suspicion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Gotta agree with that. I mean, I think Miu’d try shit, but she’d probably fuck it up—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Miu shouts. “Fuck you! I could totally kill a bitch if I wanted to! N-Not that I did!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—and I doubt she’d do anything to Kiibo,” he finishes. “‘Specially after her whole speech earlier about how special he is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “Alright, but even if Miu’s not the culprit, she’s still suspicious if she purposefully logged someone out. I noticed that when we were together it seemed like Miu kept fiddling with something in her pocket—if she had the ability to log someone out remotely, I think she probably did it one of those times.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Kokichi says. “That sounds pretty right to me. Soooo, what do you think Miu? Your lies are usually pretty funny, so you can tell a few more of them if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or she could just cut to the point,” Maki says. “Miu,” she turns to her, “Answer. Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Under Maki’s icy stare, Miu squirms and then practically bursts as she shouts, “O-Okay fine! Fucking fine! M-Maybe I logged the purple dildo out of the program! B-But that’s the only thing I did, right Bakamatsu? Never left your fucking side the whole time!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “I mean, that is true, but why would you do something like logging someone out in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Seriously!” Kaito shouts. “And why the fuck did you do it to me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She throws her hands in the air. “I just fucking picked someone at random, okay!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi presses. “Why did you plainly pick someone at all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Kokichi says. “Even if she didn’t go after Kiiboy, Miu was planning to kill, too, weren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu clenches her jaw, the sweat beading down her forehead only growing in intensity. Kaede says, “Miu… were you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets, looking down as she says, “Now that Tenko thinks about it, Miu did not seem happy that Tenko stayed behind when everyone went into the virtual world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “And… Miu seemed annoyed when we pointed out something that would have forced all of us to go, as if it was an idea that hadn’t occurred to her before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, holy shit,” Kaito says. “Miu fucking botched her own murder attempt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sh-Shut up, dickweed!” Miu snaps. “I-I did not!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “So Miu tried to murder someone but was too incompetent. I suppose that is the most logical outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “Would that also maybe explain the poison we found at the crime scene? I mean, if I remember right, Miu was sitting in the chair next to mine, and we found the puddle between our chairs…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu frantically waves her hands. “That has nothing to do with anything, you rat bitch!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Rat bitch?’” Tsumugi echoes. “Hey, I’m not some member of a cursed family!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “I take it that means we can assume she was planning to poison someone.” He sighs, “Suppose having a murderer who’s terrible at lying has some upsides.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sh-Shut up!” she shouts again. “I-I don’t know anything about a-any poison, a-and I definitely didn’t get it from Shithara’s lab!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she presses a hand to her forehead. “Alright, so, that answers that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko adds, “Tenko remembers that she found the bottle for the poison broken behind Tsumugi’s chair, and she does not remember it being there while she was in the computer room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s right,” Tsumugi says. “I remember only finding it after I logged out, so did Miu try to kill someone after she logged out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When she logged out of the program,” Maki says. “She ran straight to Kiibo in a panic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also, I think Tenko or I would have noticed if Miu logged out before that,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Remember seeing the poison, and I really don’t think this is much of a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Kokichi. “Ryoma is stepping up to the plate to rat out Miu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs, saying, “It’s not ratting out if it you’re proving someone innocent. But my point is mostly just that Tenko probably ruined Miu’s plans, and Miu’s really clumsy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Miu barks. “I’m graceful as fuck!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede simply raises an eyebrow at her defense before saying, “Ah, okay, but, Ryoma,” she turns to him, “you have a theory about what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” he says. “And Maki or Kaito could probably back this up since they were there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” Kaito says, slamming his fists together. “Let’s figure this shit out!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “Don’t think it’s worth getting that excited about…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu mumbles, “I fucking hate all of you…” as the conversation continues.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The bottle was only broken,” Tenko says, “After Tenko logged out of the program world—she saw no signs of it before that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s probably true,” Ryoma fiddles with his cigarette as he goes on, saying, “my theory is that Miu just had the poison with her—probably in her pocket or just next to her on her chair. Something like that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Getting poison is super duper easy, too!” Kokichi chimes in. “I have some of my very own, straight from Shuichi’s lab!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu protests, “I-I don’t even know where the fuck that is!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Maki says, “just let Ryoma speak.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All I was gonna say,” Ryoma continues, “is that she probably wasn’t paying much attention to the poison when she rushed to Kiibo after logging out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “It just fell on the ground and smashed by itself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It fell because Miu’s a clumsy idiot,” Maki says. “That is fairly open and shut.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Weakly, Miu mumbles, “I… I don’t even know what poison is…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “I wasn’t there when Miu left the program world, but she was in a panic when she logged out, right? So it’s completely possible the entire reason it was broken in the first place was just an accident.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Something like that, yeah,” Ryoma says. “My guess is she had more on her mind then than her failed murder attempt. It’s her own fault we discovered it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki adds, “The actual smashed bottle was behind Tsumugi’s chair, right? In her panic, it probably fell, and then Miu kicked it when she was running to Kiibo or something like that. If that happened, the broken pieces of the bottle would be farther away from some of the spill, and it would take us longer to notice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu was very distressed, too, right?” Tenko asks. “If she was yelling or screaming when she logged out, that may have also distracted from the sounds of glass breaking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” Kaede says, “especially if her kicking the bottle caused it to shatter away from everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That makes sense,” Kaito says. “But doesn’t that mean the poison isn’t really a clue to, like, anything other than the fact that Miu’s an idiot?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you shut the fuck up,” Miu says. “You fuck up trying to kill shrimp dick, and everyone just brushes over it, but when I do it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What!?” Kaede says. “Miu—you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Miu makes three!” Kokichi says. “Hmm,” he taps a finger to his chin. “Let’s see? How many killers does that make in the room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s hands practically jump to her mouth. “I-I didn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu’s target was Kokichi?” Tsumugi says. “A-And she was going to poison him!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Tenko foiled Miu’s evil plans!” Kokichi says. “And that alone was enough to ruin a plan she created an entire virtual world for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Miu—” he shakes his head, trying to take in his words. “The entire fucking thing was a setup just to kill Kokichi!?” He turns to her, clenching his jaw tightly, saying through gritted teeth, “You fucking told us to stop thinking of ways out of this school because you were planning to kill someone? What the fuck is wrong with you!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shrinks back with a yelp. “St-Stop yelling at me! M-My plan failed, a-and I just helped everyone after that, o-okay? I swear I didn’t fucking do anything else, and I’d never hurt Kiibs! So none of this crap matters!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito still seems furious, muttering again, “What the fuck is wrong with everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s wrong,” Kokichi says. “Is what I said earlier—almost everyone here is capable of being a dirty, filthy killer.” He starts sniffling, mumbling, “Everyone is so mean, getting mad and accusing me of lying…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Three different people tried to kill you, and you’re still alive somehow. How unfortunate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” says Miu, suddenly bouncing back in spirits. “He’s like a fucking cockroach!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Kaede holds no affection for Kokichi, something about the callousness of their statements and the gravity of the situation causes her to snap, “The hell are you saying—you’d be happy if you managed to kill him!? You’d be happy to be a murderer? You want to be the person we’re going to have to vote for to <i>die</i>?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu retreats immediately, hurriedly saying, “I-I didn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your actions speak for you,” Ryoma says coldly. “Even if you were unsuccessful, you still made an attempt on someone’s life—that’s almost as unforgivable as actually committing murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles cruelly. “Couldn’t have said it better myself, Ryoma. Speaking of which, do you feel like sharing anything with the class?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “Me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually you’re right,” Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “Let’s ask someone else first—it will be more exciting that way. Sooo, Kaede, why don’t you talk about what you found when you investigated the basement? It might shed a bit of light on our situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, very aware she’s being tested on something. “Kokichi, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m just asking a question!” he says. “And if you won’t tell me, then I’ll just ask Tsumugi instead! I’m sure she can give the same answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “Um, I don’t mind going over what we found in the basement, but, well,” she sends Kaede a hesitant look, “if I just say what happened, that plainly can’t be a trap, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly!” Kokichi says. “So, so, so, you and Kaede and Ryoma all went down to the basement during the investigation—tell us what you found, spare no detail.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “After Tenko left, Ryoma was still investigating a few of the other rooms in the basement, but Kaede came down to talk to me. I don’t… think we said much that was too important. Really, our conversation was plainly mostly just me complaining about how much of a mess the basement was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “We looked around a little, but the entire area was a complete mess so it was kind of a lot to look through, though Tsumugi did manage to find the Flashback Light later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Kaito suddenly looks very confused, saying, “Wait—when you mean the basement, you mean, like, the hall with all the beds and shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” says Tsumugi. “I also went down there with Kiibo earlier when we were trying to get everyone together, though… I guess if we hadn’t done that, he might not have died…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, yeah,” Kaito says, rubbing the back of his head. “That’s sad and shit, but the rooms were all messed up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems confused, and goes on to say, “That’s right—there were, like, blankets and pillows and furniture scattered all over the place. Honestly, I don’t blame you guys for not finding the Flashback Light—there was just so much to look through.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, there shouldn’t have been,” Kaito says. “Because when I went down there, everything was fucking clean.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu tosses her hair over her shoulder. “Yeah, Shittygane—you need to get your eyes fucking checked. All the crap programmed by the great Miu Iruma is clean and organized as fuck, for your information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, mildly perplexed by their conversation. She says, “Miu, the church was pretty messy, too, but are you saying that the basement was neat before Kaito got logged out and got messed up by the time Tsumugi and Kiibo showed up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually, uh,” Tenko says. “Tenko is confused about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Maki asks. “Are you really having that much trouble following along?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at Maki as she says, “What is it, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well…” she says. “When Kaede went to the library and it was messed up, she and Ryoma assumed a fight had taken place, but the bedrooms were messed up, too, and Tsumugi told us that she and Kiibo just thought they were normally like that. That just… seemed weird to Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “You’re right, that is weird…” she looks to Tsumugi. “Tsumugi, why did just think that, actually?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “Well, when I asked, that’s just what Ryoma and Kokichi said—I didn’t really think to question them at the time, I admit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “So either a hurricane went through when I was logged out, or they lied.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is a chance that Ryoma simply tore up the place when he was looking around,” Tenko says. “Awful boys tend to make awful messes, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if that’s true, then wouldn’t he have found the Flashback Light?” Maki says. “It’s impossible for it to have been hidden in a mess that wasn’t there to begin with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So those two fuckheads screwed all my shit up is what you’re saying,” Miu says. “What the fuck did you do that for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts. “Why are you getting mad at me? It’s not my fault I had to run away…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “You were running away?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Ryoma says. “If you’re trying to tell them something, just say it outright.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He puffs out his cheeks. “I don’t like being ordered around by Ryoma, especially after he chased me all around in the virtual world. So if you’re going to blame me for making a mess, you should blame Ryoma, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Tenko says. “Didn’t you bring this up in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kokichi taps his chin. “I guess I did.” He grins, folding his arms behind his head. “I just thought this would be fun to share with everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just ignore him,” Maki says. “His story doesn’t make any sense anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at her oddly. “Which part of it seems strange?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The whole thing is strange!” Miu says. “Is your head as empty as your sex life?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “Kokichi always lies—if you just take his testimony at face value after all this time, you really are hopeless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then tell me what you think he’s lying about,” Kaede insists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” Maki says. “And then maybe all of you will finally realize how idiotic listening to Kokichi is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s a hole in Kokichi’s story,” Maki says. “If you know anything about anything, you should be able to realize that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts, “Knock it off with the fucking cryptic bullshit and just tell us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what Harumaki-chan’s talking about!” Kokichi says. “All I said was that the basement got messed up when I was running from Ryoma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you think is wrong about that, Harumaki?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think it’s wrong that Kokichi would run at all,” Maki says. “Kokichi’s a weakling, and someone as fast and strong as Ryoma would catch him immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma is very fast,” Tenko says. “So, you think the chase would be over before it even started?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls his hat down, muttering, “I suppose that is one possibility…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaito says. “Why were you guys even running in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was running because Ryoma was chasing me,” Kokichi says. “Like how now I’m arguing because Maki is dumb!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “Maki, that’s wrong. I think what Kokichi’s saying is completely possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki looks more skeptical than anything else when she turns to Kaede. “You’re actually taking Kokichi’s side in this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not about sides,” Kaede says. “It’s about getting through this trial, and the fact is that I have evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh,” says Kokichi. “Kaede’s really stepping up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes. “When we were in the program, Miu explained how the avatars worked, and one of the things she said was that strength and speed were averaged out across all of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means gremlin and limp-wrist would be the same speed,” Miu says. Then she cackles, “Yup! In Miutopia, everyone finishes at the same speed!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kokichi could plausibly run away from Ryoma if he needed to?” Tenko asks. “Tenko knows awful boys like playing stupid games like that, but why would they do something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what we need to find out,” Kaede says. “Kokichi has just been giving us circular answers, so Ryoma, can you tell us why you two were fighting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs and stares at the ground. “You want me to come out and say it, but, I have to admit, I think it’s pretty obvious. After all, there’s really only one reason anyone would get into a fight in a place like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You… you were gonna kill him. God,” Kaito runs a hand over his face. “You fucking asked to come with us because… fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s cheer fades as he says, “And Ryoma makes four.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“S-So—wait,” Tsumugi says. “How long were you two fighting for—did you find the Flashback Light before you started?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “As soon as I left the library by myself, and told Ryoma that Kaito had disappeared, the chase begun! Really it was pretty silly of me to tell a known killer I was all by my lonesome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just pulls down his hat. “And there you have it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Ryoma… Ryoma,” she looks hard at him. “The day before, when you came to see Tenko at her lab, you said things were only going to get worse for us—were you planning to kill Kokichi even then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He fiddles with his cigarette and remains silent. Tenko’s voice is strained as she says, “Ryoma! Did you,” she brings her hands to up to wipe at what Kaede thinks are the beginning of tears born from anger forming in her eyes, “did you just come to Tenko’s lab to comfort her because you were planning to let her and everyone else die!? Is that why you came—you were just trying to trick Tenko into thinking you cared about anything other than yourself!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stays quiet. Kaito shouts, “Hey! Tenko’s fucking talking to you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I doubt she’d want to hear any excuses from a murderer,” Ryoma answers coldly. “Don’t know what she wants me to say other than I saw an opportunity to kill, and I took it—it’s not that complicated…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-This is horrible, but,” Tsumugi says. “You went after Kokichi, right? So what about Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut for a second before squaring her shoulders, saying, “I don’t know. But… we know four of us went into the program world ready to commit murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s what we should stay focused on!” Kokichi says. “Four merry murderers, all trying to prove their innocence!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu shouts, “We already proved my fucking innocence, you grape flavored asswipe!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we’ve been over that it’s impossible for it to be me or Kaito,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “That’s right—me and Harumaki had nothing to do with Kiibo’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Quieter, Ryoma says, “I don’t expect to be forgiven for my actions—fact is, I really shouldn’t be…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The four of them continue to talk on top of each other, each going over their story and their innocence in rapid fire. Kaede says, “Everyone—calm down, stop—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says, softly. “If you let a murderer keep talking, eventually they’ll slip up, especially if they don’t think anyone’s paying attention. Sooo,” he grins up at her, “now’s your chance to shine, Kaede! Use your magic ears, and go get ‘em!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “‘My magic ears?’” Despite the oddity of his choice of words, his point dawns on Kaede as the panic around her increases.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a deep breath, she straightens Shuichi’s hat on her head and focuses on the job in front of her that only she has the ability to complete.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Panic Talk Action)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu says, “I was with Bakamatsu the whole fucking time!”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“I’m getting sick of you blindly accusing me,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“When Kokichi and I were alone in the basement,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Especially when I have an alibi for the murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But weren’t there moments when the two of you were alone for a little while?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“I tried to kill him—that’s why the room was a mess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was seconds at fucking most! As if anyone could pull off a murder like that!” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"> Ryoma adds, “But I didn’t remember seeing the Flashback Light at all until Tsumugi found it.”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says. “I know you didn’t do it, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“How can we trust anything someone as horrible as you says!?” Tenko shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> “I suppose that is a good point…” Tsumugi says. “That actually reminds me…”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1"> “We still fucked up, y’know? Both of us—and we have to make up for that.”</span></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“That’s fair—I deserve that,” Ryoma says. “I did mean what I said earlier…”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Amidst the chaos, Kaede hears, not a confession of guilt from a killer, but something she knows is untrue. “Tsumugi,” she says suddenly. “What you said, ‘there was nothing in the virtual world that could be used as a weapon,’ is that really true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her, clearly taken by surprise at being singled out. “Um, well I thought it was—do you think that’s wrong, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” says Kokichi. “Are you doubting Miu, then? Well, I suppose that makes sense since she is a horrible, useless liar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Miu barks. “Who are you calling a liar, you little shitstain?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kaede says. “There is something I think could be used as a murder weapon, though it’s a little… unorthodox.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unorthodox?” Tsumugi says. “How unorthodox? Was it a hairpin, or a playing card, a tiara? Ugh,” she pulls a face, “it wasn’t anything like nose hair was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, no, one of those,” Kaede answers, mildly disturbed. “What I was thinking of were the golden statues Miu made of herself—they were almost everywhere in the virtual world, you could carry them around easily enough and wield them in your hands.” She sighs. “And when I briefly picked one up in the storage shed on the roof, I noticed that they’re pretty heavy, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko asks, very softly. “Were the statues heavy enough to use a blunt weapon like when…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten as the words Tenko does not say resonate deeply through her. “I think so,” she still manages to say. “You could definitely use one to attack someone—a hard enough blow to the head with one would probably result in death…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito curses under his breath. “Fuck—hey, didn’t everyone who went to the roof also go into the storage shed, like, one at a time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means anyone who went there could have taken one,” Maki says. “So then, the only people who couldn’t have done it are me, Tenko, and…” she takes a deep breath, “Kokichi, apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi’s not quite off the table yet,” Ryoma says. “There were statues in the library, too—so it’s a possibility he grabbed one there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, over Kokichi beginning to sniffle about Ryoma bullying him, Tenko shouts, “Don’t <i>you</i> accuse him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After everything that’s happened since the trial began, that alone seems to stun Ryoma, leaving him to only mutter, “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t you—how dare you,” her anger causes her to trip over her words, but Tenko finally manages to say, “Kokichi wouldn’t kill anyone, a-and—and when Himiko died, Gonta was killed, too! And Tenko thought that because of that when you came to her lab maybe you understood!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks at her for a moment before letting his eyes flicker back to the floor. “Don’t know what to tell you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sweeps her arm over the room. “Tenko has said so many times how tired she is of everyone only just thinking of themselves! She’s tired of people keeping secrets and lying to her, and trying to hurt each other while Himiko’s killer just gets to watch us and laugh!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito also hangs his head in shame. “Shit, Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thought,” she rubs angrily at her eyes, “Tenko thought that since Ryoma lost someone important to him, too, maybe he’d understand just how horrible this game is. But it looks like she was wrong…” she shakes her head, snapping, “that’s what Tenko gets for thinking she could believe in boys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t take his eyes off the floor as he pulls at his hat. “You’re right,” he says. “This game is horrible—everything about our situation is horrible, and I’m only making it worse.” He shakes his head. “I’m sorry—that’s all I can tell you, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t respond other than to wipe her eyes on the back of her sleeves. Beside her, Kokichi hums. “Very insightful, Tenko—and while we’re picking on Ryoma, I think Kaede should finish saying why she thought Miu’s tacky statues could be the murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard, keeping her gaze fixed on him as she says, “When Tsumugi and I were investigating the bedrooms in the basement, we found a statue hidden in one of the rooms. And… that wouldn’t be too suspicious by itself, but there wasn’t a storage of them there like in the library or on the roof, which means someone brought it there deliberately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it’s pretty hard to believe someone would just decide to carry one of those around with them for no reason,” Maki says. “If it was found in a place where we know there was a fight, it all plainly adds up to someone trying to use it as a makeshift murder weapon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Miu says. “How ‘bout Ryomat—you try and bash in the midget’s brains with my beautiful bod?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares at her. “Wouldn’t phrase it like that, but that is what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can confirm!” Kokichi says happily. “Being chased around by itself is pretty scary, but being chased by someone holding something that looks like Miu?” He shudders. “Ugh, gives me chills just thinking about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That all makes sense,” Kaito says. “But,” he scratches the back of his head, “are we any closer to figuring out what happened to Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, that’s right,” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “Maybe one of the statues of Miu could have been used as a murder weapon, but… there plainly wasn’t one near his body at the crime scene.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That’s right, and there’s a few other mysteries we still don’t know the answers to, although,” she crosses her arms, “the one that’s the strangest to me has to be just how quickly Kiibo was killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He entered a room and died in seconds at most,” Maki says. “If we can trust the timeframe we’ve been given, it’s likely he had just made it past the loading screen when his death occurred.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “Killed right after spawning is the absolute worst—though it makes sense Miu would create a game as awful and bug-ridden as her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu scowls. “There only bug in the program was you, you little pest.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow as she thinks over her time entering the library again. “Hey,” she says. “Maybe it was just me, but did the loading screen in the library seem to take longer than the others?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand through his hair, trying to recall. “Fuck—hell if I can remember—maybe? Why? You think someone took advantage of that if it was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The loading screens,” Tenko says softly, “Tenko remembers being very surprised when she tried going through one—you’re totally blind and deaf and it’s impossible to move…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “Completely helpless, wouldn’t you say? Be pretty easy to sneak up on someone if they were in a position like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, um,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe this is wrong, but wouldn’t the culprit get stuck in the loading screen, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If they followed after Kiibo, they would,” Kaede says. “Which means, I think the only thing we can—<i>have</i>—to assume about Kiibo’s death is that someone set up a trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why we assumin’ that?” Miu asks. “‘Cause everyone’s got alibis?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Right—that and the fact that Kiibo was basically alone when he died means the only way this could have happened is if someone set something up beforehand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only people who could have done something like that are Kaito—who we know is innocent—and Kokichi,” Maki says. “So Kokichi’s the culprit, and it’s an answer we could have come to hours ago if you weren’t all so obsessed with believing in a compulsive liar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Compulsive <i>friendly</i> liar,” Kokichi corrects. “But nope! Good try, Maki! You’re on the right track.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “Kokichi—knock it off. If you say crap like that it’ll only make you more suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So when I said everyone was obsessed with defending him,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede decides to cut in. “If we want to clear Kokichi of suspicion, all we need to do is figure out how long he was in the library by himself. I… have a feeling the trap used to kill Kiibo probably took a while to make.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, maybe purple dildo number one helped purple dildo number two,” Miu suggests. “They’ve been pretty fucking buddy-buddy and crap, haven’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” Tenko says, still holding her hands close to her heart. “Tenko… doesn’t know if she can trust them, but, with the way Kaito has been acting, she really doubts he would help Kokichi do something that could result in his death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would never,” Kaito says. “My word probably doesn’t fucking mean much, but I swear I didn’t help set up any crap that would hurt anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, if we believe that Kaito didn’t help,” Tsumugi says. “Um, then if Kokichi was the killer, he would have had to build whatever trap was used alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, point for Tsumugi!” Kokichi cheers. “Buuut, I was alone in the library for barely a minute at most.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “And we’re going to just believe that without evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Evidence… evidence… evi… dence… Kaede!” he beams as he turns to her. “You’re really good at carrying the team, even if most of the team are dirty murderers, sooo what do you think? Have any special evi-dence that can prove an angel like me innocent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “Tenko,” she says. “You remember what time Kaito was logged out, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, yes,” Tenko responds. “Tenko… didn’t have much to do in the computer room, so she was watching the clocks a lot, and she remembers that it was about five-forty when Kaito started suddenly panicking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fuck does that get us?” Miu asks. “There wasn’t a fucking clock in the virtual world, so unless one of us is physic, whatever time flowerbrain got zapped doesn’t mean anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You say that like you’re not the one responsible,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to examine Kokichi. There were no ladders in the library, and he had no one to help him. The chances that he could actually, physically set up the same trap she did so long ago are slim, but, revealing what she suspects the nature of the trap is has other complications. And… even if she has to lie, there’s another lie she needs exposed more. Perhaps her own sins will come out in time, but for now, there’s still another way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “I have other evidence, too. Something Tenko and I were able to get from the computer room at the end of the investigation,” she shifts her gaze to give Tenko a meaningful look, “and I know if we all trust exactly what it says, then we should be able to shed some light on exactly what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems a bit confused but nods along easily enough. “That’s right—Tenko was able to get something that… might possibly prove Kokichi innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, don’t let me stop, you,” Kokichi says, pressing a finger to his lips, “I’m sure Kaede won’t let us down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw, and the arguments begin anew.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi could have set up a trap to kill Kiibo,” Maki says. “He had the means, the motive, and the time to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Slow down, Harumaki,” Kaito says. “We can’t know if all that’s true yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But isn’t the problem with knowing if he had the time to build a trap,” Tsumugi says, “the fact that there were no clocks in the virtual world?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey! Hey, Miu!” Kokichi says. “Why’d you take out all the clocks?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She growls, “I didn’t take out crap that wasn’t there to begin with!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means there was nothing keeping track of time,” Maki says, “and that means we only have Kokichi’s word to decide if he left the scene of the crime when he says he did—and we all know how much we can trust that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “This would be so much easier if one of the bedrooms had just had an alarm clock or something so Ryoma could have seen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t see anything like that,” Ryoma says. “But even if there was, my word’s not worth much either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “When I first tried to get everyone’s alibis, I also thought it was true that there was no way to keep track of time in the program… but it turns out that’s wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito asks, “Is that the evidence you and Tenko found?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where exactly did you get this evidence from?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tenko says. “A-Actually one of the Monokubs got it for Tenko… the red one said it wanted to avenge its father.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From just in front of Monokuma’s stand, there’s a squawk of, “She doesn’t even know my name! Actually… what’s my name again? Monokid? Monomi? Monoch—” before it gets punched by the pink one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Sincerely doubt there’s a less reliable source than that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s all we have,” Kaede says. “And it seems odd to me that they’d go to all that trouble to fake such extensive evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, what is it already?” Miu asks. “Quit being a fucking tease and spit it out!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quirks an eyebrow, deeply unimpressed by Miu’s reaction. She says, “It’s a read out of every time someone used one of the card readers—apparently that information was being recorded with the person’s name, place, and the time they used it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means it is possible to know when Kokichi left the library,” Tsumugi says. “So, what does the log say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I looked it over with Tenko earlier, and it backs up what Kokichi told us,” Kaede says, keeping her voice as even as possible. “Kaito was logged out at five-forty, and apparently Kokichi used his card to exit the library just two minutes later, which isn’t nearly enough time to set up a secret trap that none of us would be able to easily spot after the murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods curtly. “That is correct,” she confirms. Beside her, Kokichi just looks amused.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And across the room, Kaede hears the response she had been hoping to get—Miu making a slight, spluttering choked noise. “Wait—what?” she says. “W-When the fuck did that happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi responds, “Well, if you take a time, and you add two minutes to that, then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The real question,” Maki says, shooting a dark glare at Miu, “is why were our movements being recorded?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves her hands wildly in defense, saying, “D-Don’t fucking ask me! The bears put them in and shit, you know—to build team bone-ing or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do… do you mean bonding?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaito says. “Even if that’s why they were there, the fuck would they need to record all that crap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doubt anyone’s interested in the exact time people ‘become friends’ or ‘start getting along,’” Ryoma says. “But… if that is true, Kokichi can’t be a suspect then, can he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I am cleared from suspicion once again!” Kokichi says. “Personally, I’d like to thank the academy, my parents, Kaede—even if she does smell—my cat—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Miu jabs a finger at him. “You sit the fuck down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Is there a problem, Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck yeah, there’s a problem!” she says. “Hey!” she barks. “Chabashitra—you still got that log or whatever with you? I wanna take a look.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko starts to sweat. “U-Uh, Tenko left it in the computer room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I don’t think Monokuma would just let us go back for it,” Kaede says. “So, if you have a problem, we’re going to have to just talk about it here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kaede!” Kokichi says. “You’re being so mean to Miu—and I thought you two were best friends! Though,” his face darkens even as his smile grows, “I suppose it makes sense after what she did to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Did to me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Miu says. “I’ll have you know that I have fucking standards. Maybe Bakamatsu’s like a six or a six and a half, but I only go for other tens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think there’s a conversation I want to hear less in my life than this one,” Maki says. “Miu, say something useful or don’t say anything at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She retreats in on herself, mumbling, “I-I was j-just thinking that, uh—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She thinks Kaede’s lying about when Kokichi left the library,” Ryoma says abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips towards him. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head in response. “The fact is if you think logically about Kokichi’s situation after Kaito logged out, it’s literally impossible for him to have left the library at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito slowly says, “That’s… right, isn’t it? Fuck—if I left the library, and Kokichi was alone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He wouldn’t have a second person to leave the library with him,” Maki finishes. “Which means he should have been trapped.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But obviously I wasn’t!” Kokichi says. “Oh, good thing, too—libraries make me break out in hives, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… doubt that last part is true,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “To stay on track, all of this can only mean one thing about the rules of the virtual world we were told when we first entered.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu’s a liar!” Kokichi practically sings.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, a different voice says, “Miu is what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At it’s call, everyone immediately turns to the source of the sound, which happens to be Miu hurriedly pulling her monopad out of her pocket. Even from her distant podium, Kaede can see a soft glow emanating from it, and when it speaks again, saying, “did I miss something important?” there is absolutely no mistake that Kiibo is back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito physically leans almost all the way across the empty podium separating him from Miu to say, “Hey! Kiibo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scoffs, turning away from the sight. “How convenient.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, my apologies,” Kiibo says. “If you were discussing something important, please continue. I will do my best to follow along.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right!” Kokichi says. “Kiiboy is dead and should be quiet! Let us humans have a chance to shine!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma rolls his eyes. “Kiibo, all you need to know is that Miu lied to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Lied?” he echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… just wants to know why she would do something like that,” Tenko says. “Miu sent up the program that way for a reason, right? So… what is that reason?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu sweats as she spits out, “Alright—fine! Maybe I lied, but that doesn’t mean squat fuck, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you don’t intend to just answer her question, do you?” Maki sighs. “Then we’ll just have to figure it out ourselves then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Softly Kiibo says, “Miu?” as they begin to debate her lie.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu plainly lied to us when we entered the program,” Tsumugi says. “The fact that Kokichi was able to leave the library alone proves that, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The library…” Kiibo parrots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “So the ID cards were complete bullshit, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“ID cards…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But… why would Miu do something like that?” Tenko asks. “Was she trying to keep everyone in the program divided?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Divided…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, or maybe she was trying to trap us!” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A… trap…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito suggests, “maybe she was just recording us? Or tracking? Or spying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And maybe you were all just shutting the fuck up!” Miu yells. “Can’t you see you’re scaring, Kiibs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite his previous echoes, Kiibo remains quiet after her last statement.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s it,” Kaede says. “She was tracking us—when we got the log from the computer room, the bear said that apparently that information was also being sent somewhere inside the virtual world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Aaaand, I think we can all agree only one person here could have set something like that up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu sweats even harder, shaking her head as she mutters, “N-No, I-I don’t even know how to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kaede says. “Please, just tell us the truth. You’re someone I really want to believe in,” <i>because I know you’re not the mastermind</i>, she thinks, “for a lot of reasons. So please just admit it, especially if you’re not the culprit—keeping secrets only makes finding Kiibo’s real killer harder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kiibo repeats to himself, “My real killer…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu bites her lip as she stares down at the screen in her hands. Then, taking in one tight breath, she says, “fine—fine. M-Maybe the card readers were just to track everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito prompts, “And you did something that shitty because?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Cause I was fucking scared!” she shouts. “‘Cause I can’t fucking trust anyone in this hellhole besides Kiibs and Bakamatsu, and the second he left my goddamn side, someone murdered him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Were you…” Tenko begins. “Were you also afraid of the mastermind, Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her grip tightens even more at Tenko’s question before she darkly mutters, “you all know they’re gonna fucking come for me. They’re just biding their fucking time before they come to murder me in my sleep—and don’t any of you assholes pretend you didn’t know that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “you’ve… been thinking that for a while now, haven’t you? Miu…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares at her, clearly unimpressed as she says, “You… actually are that paranoid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it turns out we should have been the paranoid ones,” Kokichi says. “After all—Miu was watching our every movement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu rolls her eyes. “Wasn’t fucking watching shit—yeah, I had crap telling me where people were going, but it was just a list like what I’m guessing the scissor sisters found.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess,” Kaito says, “guess that also explains why you fucked up the bridge, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were afraid of us…” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “But… after everything everyone confessed today, and the fact that the mastermind is still hiding… I guess I’d be pretty afraid of us, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There, Bakamatsu,” Miu says sharply. “You fucking happy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “I… don’t think I would say happy, but,” she squares her shoulders, “I do think I know how this incident played out and who the killer is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “I think you’ve known for a while now and didn’t want to say anything, buuut,” he beams at her, “get ready to pump yourself up, Kaede! This is where the real fight is going to begin!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The real fight?” Tenko says. “If Kaede needs to fight someone then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then she’ll have to face a very special challenger <i>and</i>,” he grins. “Another very special someone from the past—Rantaro!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces as the others startle. Kaito says, “The fuck are you bringing him up for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “D-Did Rantaro’s ghost—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s just trying to delay the inevitable to entertain himself,” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins towards Kokichi to deliver a sharp chop to the top of his head, something fierce and protective gleaming in her eyes. “Ow!” Kokichi whines, hands flying to where she hit him. “What was that for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you are just trying to torment Kaede further, then you will have to answer to Tenko—trial or not,” she says harshly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But I was just trying to warn her—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were threatening her!” Tenko shouts back. “And Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says. “It’s okay—I know what he’s talking about.” She pulls Shuichi’s hat just over her eyes. “I… I had a feeling this would come up since the investigation, no matter how much I didn’t want it to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives her an odd look, crossing her arms as she says, “Are you confessing to being the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “But this murder is my fault, too, because this is a copycat crime, and there’re very, very few people who could have done something like that. In fact, there’s really only one person, and I’m so, so sorry.”</span></p>

I think the culprit is reasonably simple to pinpoint now, though I'd be a pretty bad mystery writer if it wasn't after they went over almost all the clues, haha. Also, as you might be able to guess, I've wanted to have a trial where the twist was multiple murder attempts on top of each other, and I decided since this is DR that I might as well see just how many I could stack, though perhaps four might be a little much, haha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Anyway, thank you for reading as we near the end of chapter 4!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. She says, “The culprit is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Ryoma says, “It’s fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Said it’s fine,” he says almost nonchalant. “You don’t need to say it. I confess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Kaede stares at him, furrowing her brow in confusion. “You what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I confess,” Ryoma says again. “What more do you want?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares at him. “So it was you… you were planning to kill this whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Guess I was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “What the fuck, man? Why did you keep quiet until now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because the little assmunch wanted to escape and leave us all to die!” Miu shouts, slamming a hand on her podium. “And he’s only confessing because he doesn’t want Bakamatsu to beat the shit out of him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean… verbally?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shakes his head. “Think I’ve put up enough of a fight already—don’t see much of a point in making myself look even worse by resisting when it’s pointless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s glare intensifies. “So you killed one of our friends, lied to us, and now you’re just going to let yourself die because you don’t want to look bad!? How—how can you be this horrible!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t know what to tell you,” Ryoma says with a sigh. “Just figured it be better to hear the truth straight from me instead of making Kaede do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu glares, too. “You know what? Fuck you. You fucking murdered Kiibs because you were pissed off that rat face got away.” She turns to Kaede. “Kill him, blimp tits.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just looks at him searchingly. “Ryoma… what is this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s a confession,” Kokichi says. “What do you think about that, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are you asking her?” Kaito asks. “Ryoma’s the one we need to be interrogating, right? Like,” he sighs, “I get confessing to crap because… it’s the right thing to do, and this is about Ryoma not Kaede, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma…” Kiibo says. “He… killed me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” Ryoma answers. “And I had the time and opportunity. Tsumugi and Kokichi can testify as much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi fidgets. “Well, I did suspect Ryoma a bit during the investigation, I’ll admit. I mean, he was the only one who was alone with Kiibo, so I just plainly thought that made him a little suspicious…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you were right,” Ryoma says. “This case really isn’t that complicated. Don’t have much interest in setting elaborate traps or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares at him. “So… you’re saying our assumption that someone set a trap was wrong. That’s your argument?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not arguing,” he responds. “Just saying what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “The simplest solution usually is the correct one, but… sometimes someone’s so suspicious they wrap around to not being suspicious anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And sometimes you should shut the fuck up!” Miu says. “I can’t fucking believe Kiibo was killed as gremlin’s sloppy seconds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “So… that’s your motive. ayou just wanted to escape and… you saw an opportunity to go after Kiibo after Kokichi got away?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “That’s righ—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki cuts in. “There’s more to it than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Kokichi says. “Does Maki know something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pauses for a moment too long, and Kaito says, “It’s okay to tell us. We’re gonna believe you, you know, and we’re also done with suspecting you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shoots a glare towards Kaede out of the corner of her eye. “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki, please,” Kaede says, taking a moment to swallow her pride. “I want to hear it. If you know what the motive is, it might help me… make sense of what’s going on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki regards her warily for a moment. Then, “There are only two people who ever had the keycard and the opportunity to discover where it went to. And the ability.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The ability?” Tenko asks. “Isn’t having the keycard the ability?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “You’d need more than that because the keycard goes to a door at the end of the trapped tunnel Kaede forced us to try and use to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “You—you both made it through the tunnel?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weeeell,” Kokichi says. “Without the rest of us slowing them down, a professional athlete like Ryoma and a trained super assassin like Maki could probably do it after a few tries.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “Harumaki… during the black out, you said there was something you wanted to check, right? And no one saw you the whole time—did you go to the tunnels?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” she says. “And that was the only time I went there. I discovered a door that required a keycard and left.” She shakes her head. “Whether I could have made it through the tunnels when the traps were operational is irrelevant because I never went back after that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So do you or do you not fucking know why ankle biter went berserk?” Miu asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I never saw the motive, if that’s what you’re asking,” Maki says. “But Ryoma did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because he had the opportunity?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because he told me,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at her for a moment before turning to Ryoma who stares somewhere far away. “Ryoma, did you? And why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He told me he’d help me if I wanted to kill someone,” Maki says. “In other words, he offered to be my accomplice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “You—you just wanted someone dead that badly…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, maybe,” Kokichi says. “I guess some killers just always have a thirst for blood. I mean,” his face darkens, “it was easy to talk down someone like Kaito, but Ryoma’s used to killing, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not the point,” Maki says. “Offering to be an accomplice is strange, no matter how you look at it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to agree when Ryoma says, “it’s not strange if Tenko’s right. Saw the motive and decided to kill—that’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fucking hell,” Kaito breathes out. “The fuck was the motive then if it’d make you wanna do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doesn’t matter,” Ryoma says. “Already told Kaede—some truths are better off not being discovered. So,” he sighs. “Think that’s all I have to say. If you don’t mind, I’d like to start the vote now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “The vote… this is how this ends?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His statement seems odd and disconnected, but something about it causes the already uneasy feeling in Kaede’s stomach to spur her into more immediate action. “Wait—I really think we should talk about this more,” she says. “Ryoma, I know you keep saying this murder was simple, so why don’t you just go over what you did?” He sends her a skeptical look, and she quickly tacks on, “Just to clear all of our doubts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You want me to explain how I killed someone?” Ryoma asks in a low voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko and Miu already requested I do it,” Kaede says. “But there are still a few things I’m not sure about, and I’d like to hear it from you, since you are confessing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s clear the fact that he’s being tested does not escape him, and Ryoma pauses for a moment before saying, “fine, here’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Miu says. “How’d you fucking do it, Ryomat?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s not much to it,” he says. “Just followed after Kiibo when he went to the library.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you were already planning to kill him at that point,” Maki says. “Because you failed to kill Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “That’s right. Then when we were alone, I just bashed him over the head and came back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you acted like you had just discovered the body?” Tsumugi asks. “I guess… the first witness usually is the most suspicious…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He could have gotten a statue from the shed on the roof or something,” Kaito says. “We were all idiots and just let everyone go in there one at a time…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then he just picked it up and kept it with him after the murder,” Miu. “Probably shoved it up his fucking asshole or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares at her. “You do realize I’m a convicted murderer who’s about to die, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She withers. “A-As if s-someone like you could in-intimidate the great Miu Iruma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kokichi says. “Lying is my thing! You guys all back off! Especially if you’re just going to turn this into amateur hour!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Kaede says. “Your story is that after killing Kiibo, you took the statue with you, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He narrows his eyes. “There a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is because it seems strange when compared with facts we already know,” she says. “When you were chasing Kokichi, you dropped a statue in one of the bedrooms, right? Specifically the one Tsumugi said she and Kiibo found the two of you in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And?” Ryoma presses. “Failing to see how these things are connected.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They’re not connected because they don’t make any sense together,” Kaede says. “No matter how you think of it, isn’t it strange that you would purposefully hide one murder weapon when you were carrying another one on you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His gaze darkens. “Heard people coming and panicked—that’s all there is to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You keep saying that,” Kaede says. “And I think it’s because you’re lying. You don’t want to explain because your story will fall apart if you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares. “And tell me—why would I lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Kaede says meeting his stare. “But I know you are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “So,” her hands clench into fists. “Ryoma is just jerking us around? You just want this horrible trial for a friend who isn’t even dead to last longer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe he’s protecting the culprit,” Maki says with a pointed look towards Kaede. “It’s not like we haven’t heard a false confession before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to face her. She says, “That’s right—we have fallen for false confessions before, but,” she glances to Ryoma, “if Ryoma is protecting the culprit, I have no idea why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not protecting anyone,” Ryoma says. “I am the culprit, and I already told you how I did it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaede said that didn’t make any sense,” Kaito says. “And I’m gonna fucking believe her. Also,” he gives him an odd look, “what the fuck has been up with you? Earlier you were pushing really hard for the idea that Kiibo killed himself or whatever? Do you want us to vote wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What kind of jackass would try and do something as fucking dumb as that?” Miu asks. “They’d fucking die, too—idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “I don’t think anyone would do something like that considering what would happen, so maybe Ryoma is protecting the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is a deep bitterness in Tenko’s word, “Ryoma has already shown he doesn’t care about any of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good point, good point,” Kokichi says. “After all, the only person Ryoma cared about is already dead, soooo maybe we’re looking at this wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki finishes, “Maybe he has nothing left to lose, which could be why he offered to be an accomplice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shuts his eyes as he pulls down his hat. Miu says, “Fucking Christ—if you wanted to kill yourself, you could of just done it without taking us all down with you. And!” she jabs a finger at him, “You could of left Kiibs the fuck alone!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma remains silent. Kaito sighs, saying, “clamming up now?</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede listens to the accusations being thrown around her, and something odd ticks in her brain as a sudden connection comes into focus. She chooses her words carefully as she says, “I think it’s pretty obvious that Ryoma isn’t about to tell us the truth, but if we think about what we’ve talked about earlier… I have a feeling we’ll figure something out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have a feeling?” Maki says. “And we’re all just going to rely on that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We are,” Kaede says. “Because it’s the only way to get someone else to tell us the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Interesting. Find a different liar to poke holes in a liar’s lies. Alright,” he folds his hands behind his head. “I’ll follow you, Kaede, this seems pretty not boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says. “Who else would lie? Are they trying to protect the culprit, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think this is about the culprit,” Kaede says. “I think it’s about the motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki already told us he saw the motive,” Kaito says. “So that already makes him pretty suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only one,” Ryoma says. “I’m the only one who saw the motive, which means, yes, I am suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “I don’t think that’s true either, but I also think the person that saw the motive is keeping it secret from us, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone’s always keeping secrets,” Tenko says softly. “Everyone always lies, and Tenko is so tired of it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw,” Kokichi says. “That’s really sad, Tenko… I guess this whole conversation would be pretty frustrating if you hadn’t seen the Flashback Light that was hidden in the woods.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly whips towards him. “The what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito presses a hand to his forehead. “Well that fucking answers that about who was lying…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course it was fucking Kokichi!” Miu says. “Who the hell else would’ve been lying!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede says. “She was the person who I was trying to get to confess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares. “And you were intending to drag it out and catch me in a contradiction?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “You already lied about seeing the motive after Kaito told you everyone would believe in you. Obviously you had already made the decision to withhold information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And apparently that was a wise choice,” Maki says. “As I am being doubted now without saying anything even after someone else already confessed to lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice rings out, “Did… Kokichi only say that to move the conversation forward?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she hears Kokichi begin to giggle. She pinches the bridge of her nose. “It seems like it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Tsumugi says. “That plainly makes a lot of sense… I found the Flashback Light in the basement, and I thought they only missed it because everything was so messed up, but since that isn’t the case…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means either shortstack one or two had it,” Miu says. “And horseface went to go jerk off by himself for a while, didn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Me and Maki were the only two people to ever go off on our lonesome, and she was just boring and never left the entrance hall.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you saw the Flashback Light and dropped it or something when Ryoma was chasing you?” Kaede asks. “And the Flashback Light was also the motive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaito says. “Hold up—wasn’t the Flashback Light supposed to be about the outside world or something? And if that was also the motive, and the motive made Ryoma wanna die then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow, wow, wow!” says Kokichi. “My beloved Kaito said something super smart! I’m so proud of you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just shakes his head. “Guess that means I guessed right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You did,” Kokichi says. “At least, you guessed right that the Flashback Light showed something super extra horrible that would totally explain why Ryoma’s acting the way he is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sends his a dark glare. “So you think you know everything then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do!” Kokichi says. “After all, solving this case is a piece of cake if you had all the information I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means you also knew the culprit before we even started,” Kaede says. “And you know how they did it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” he answers nonchalantly. “But you guys would all cry and call me a liar if I just said everything outright, <i>and</i> it would totally ruin the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Then tell us already! How can you be so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaito says sharply. “Kaede, you said you thought Harumaki saw the motive earlier… was it because she was also talking about Kiibo killing himself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki goes silent. Leaving Kaede to swallow as she says, “That’s right. Ryoma and Maki were the two who were the most confident in that theory, while it just seemed off to the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if the motive is as awful as Kokichi says it is,” Kaito says. “God,” he runs a hand over his face. “Just how fucked are we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I doubt any of them are about to tell us, which means we just have to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The outside world is gone,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words stop even the noises of the slightest shifting in the room. Kaede works her mouth uselessly for a few moments, attempting to process her confession as Kiibo says, “The outside world…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma speaks up, “the Flashback we saw earlier only had part of the story. The truth is there’s nothing left…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi has a very soft smile on his face as he says, “and that’s the reason both of them were keeping quiet. Maki was trying to protect us, and Ryoma,” his grin turns dark, “Ryoma was trying to throw the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t seem angry when he responds—just exhausted. “What of it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head rapidly. “Y-You—you were trying to kill us all!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-this,” Tsumugi says suddenly looking very pale. “This can’t be happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu jabs a finger at Maki. “You’re a fucking liar!” she screams. “All of you are fucking lying to try and trick us! There’s no <i>fucking</i> way any of that bullshit is true!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait—fucking wait!” Kaito shouts suddenly. “That can’t fucking be true. What about the stupid motive videos and shit? Were those fake or—when were they made!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t know,” Ryoma replies coldly. “But it turns out there’s nothing for any of us outside of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And inside here,” Kokichi says. “Is an evil mastermind trying to kill us all while we bloodily turn on each other at the drop of a hat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares in horror at the situation in front of her. “There’s nothing… and,” she looks at Ryoma, “and you were trying to… trying to mercy kill us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks at the ground as he says, “our options are either we stay in this school with someone trying to make us all kill each other hiding among us for the rest of our lives… or we die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no, no,” Miu says, now raking her hands through her hair. “Shut up! That’s not fucking true! We’re already in hell, you just can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tell everyone the truth?” Kokichi asks. “Why? I thought you guys loved the truth—that’s why you made everyone expose their secrets, right? It was all for the best because it was the truth, don’t you think so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip. “This was… the only way to make sure we would survive this trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko mutters to the ground, “Is there really nothing left? Has everyone been killing each other to escape into nothing?” She looks to Kaede, tears already forming in her eyes. “After everything that’s happened… we do want to survive,” and it’s obvious she’s pleading with Kaede to give her an answer, “Don’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of,” Kaede can’t help but suddenly feel her resolve start to crumble. “Of course we do. We can’t just give up just because… because there’s nothing left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “And this is why I chose to stay quiet.” She simply sighs and crosses her arms. “It was inevitable you would all react this way. Sparing you seemed like a mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No—No!” Miu says, her entire body beginning to tremble. “Th-That’s not true—you’re just fucking lying—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo says, “Miu, please calm dow—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We—we can’t be the only people left,” she says. “We can’t be the only fucking people left! You’re trying to fucking trick us into—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the truth,” Ryoma says. “And I say we weigh our options.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito breathes out, “what the fuck does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means we vote for someone who we know is innocent,” Ryoma says. “Or we refuse to vote at all—either way, we can just end our suffering here, and whoever’s watching us for their own amusement won’t have their game anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we all just die…” Tsumugi says, now ghostly pale. “That’s… that’s our best option…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her control over the situation slip away rapidly. “N-No! Everyone wait—we can’t just… we can’t just do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why not?” Ryoma asks. “There’s nothing on the outside, and Kokichi’s said a hundred times over that the only thing in here is a bunch of murderers. If we keep making ourselves go on, all it’ll do is give the mastermind something to laugh at before we kill each other off slower.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s,” Kaede says as the deep hopelessness of his logic begins to catch up with her. “That’s not… we—we have to do something, anything else…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shakes his head. “If you have other suggestions, I’m listening. Think I’ve learned that looking for a reason to live’ll only just cause more suffering, but you’re welcome to try.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” Kaede says. She glances around the room at the increasingly hopeless faces surrounded her, each presenting their own unique reaction to what is possibly pure, calculated despair. “I…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s nothing left for us,” Ryoma says. “That’s the secret of the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rubs at her eyes as tears begin to stream down her face. “Everyone who’s died—it was all for nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu keeps chanting to herself. “This has to be a lie, this has to be a lie, this has to be a fucking lie…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there really no hope?” Tsumugi asks almost absently, eyes focused somewhere distant as a nervous sweat began to break out on her forehead. “Is our only choice really to just give up and die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “We can’t just—we can’t just give up,” his voice falters slightly, and his words sound far too hallow for comfort, “we need to keep fighting… we can’t just…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you,” Maki says. “It would have been better for everyone not to know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice echoes, “Is this… despair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede finds herself suddenly at a loss. Their words seem to repeat in circles, talking about how it’s all hopeless, how dying if their only option, if they live, they’ll all only keep suffering.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears Kiibo again, asking if there really is no hope.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “Kaede, I said this was the truth, but,” he smiles, “it’s a truth the mastermind told us—and a lie can easily become the truth if you don’t let anything contradict it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” he continues. “We should all just die here—is that the truth?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede suddenly shouts. “No! Everyone,” she turns to the group as a whole. “Everyone, shut up and listen to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” Kaito says, looking up at her. “You—what are you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m telling you all to think,” she says, summoning as much authority as she can. “Think about this motive, and think about who gave it to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki simply raises an eyebrow at her. “Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we’ve suddenly decided that we can trust him?” Kaede says. “We all decided the last motive was impossible, so why do we believe this one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her small seeds of doubt for their situation spur Miu into saying, “Y-Yeah! That’s what I’m saying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And earlier,” Kaede continues. “Kaito pointed out that this contradicts the earlier motive of the videos. One of them has to be a lie, and we can’t just accept that the best path is to just die and not discover which it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Maki says. “Your answer is… we just deny it? Even if we saw it with our own eyes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten. “I’m saying we keep thinking for ourselves. As long as we’re in this game, the mastermind has complete control over what they decide is real or not. And if this is the motive they gave us, then it means they want us to all die here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The mastermind,” Tenko says, clenching her fists. “They also want us to just die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe,” Kokichi says. “They want just one person to die—one person who could make it through the tunnels and might be feeling kinda down after the mastermind sent their buddy off to his death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glares. “Are you trying to say this was just a trick meant for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not a trick,” Kokichi says. “Personally, I think calling it a trap makes more sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“None of what you’re saying makes sense,” he bites back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m saying,” he presses a finger to his lips. “That there was a smashed microscope in Gonta’s lab after his death—now why would anyone do something like that? To me it looked like someone was trying to hide evidence…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma narrows his eyes. “And you think the mastermind targeted me over that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “Could be! I’m just throwing out theories here, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opts to interrupt, asking, “Ryoma, I do remember you and Gonta having found something earlier—right before Gonta’s death…” her words seem to still some of Ryoma’s anger and his gaze shifts to the ground as she continues. “It’s just… strange to think that if you found something secret the mastermind would only target one of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think I get it,” Kaito says suddenly. “There’s always, like, some hidden meaning or shit behind the motives right? So was this one just targeted at Ryoma or something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with her hat. “From what we’ve talked about, I think it’s certainly possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you also think I’m an idiot who fell for it,” Ryoma says. Kaede opens her mouth to contradict him, but he just raises a hand. “Don’t try and make excuses for me—I won’t accept them, and I doubt anyone here wants to listen to how sorry they should feel for the guy who almost got them all killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His eyes noticeably dart towards Tenko for a moment before returning to the ground. Ryoma pulls his hat down lower. “If you’ll still believe a word I have to say, Kiibo was already dead when I went to the library. Only thing I did was pick up the murder weapon which was right next to his body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Thank you, Ryoma. I think that confirms what I thought earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we’re still going through with this?” Maki says. “Even if Ryoma was tricked, we’re still just going to ignore the fact that the outside world is destroyed and keep playing Monokuma’s game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to her, and, for once, she isn’t entirely unsympathetic to the other girl as she says, “Ryoma laid it out for us earlier pretty well. Right now our only options are to either get through this class trial and try and figure out what’s actually going on, or die.” She shifts to address the others as a whole. “I’m aware a lot of people here probably don’t trust me—and I’m about to give you one more reason not to—but, right now, I refuse to just die here without knowing why we’ve been put through everything we have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “And that means outing the culprit, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. She takes another breath. “The truth is that there was a trap set in the library, and the only person who had the ability to do such a thing is Miu.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu jerks her head to her, seeming genuinely confused. “The hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Kaede says, voice that of a disapproving parent. “Did you set a trap in the library?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves a hand, more annoyed than anything else. “Okay, yeah—fine I set a fucking trap, but it was complete failure.” She moves to tick off on her fingers, “first of all, it was supposed to target Kokichi, which didn’t fucking happen, and second, there wasn’t a statue or anything, so the entire thing was just a big tease, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “It wasn’t. Ryoma just said he picked up the murder weapon to try and hide what had happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Miu says. “But still—Kiibs’s the victim! Maybe I set a fucking trap and was planning to use you as my alibi or something and <i>maybe</i> frame spacecase, but none of that crap matters because it didn’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “Did you just tell us your entire plan to kill Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaito says. “What even was this fucking trap? I didn’t see shit while I was in the library with Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I also plainly didn’t see anything out of ordinary when I went to go investigate Kiibo’s body,” Tsumugi adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows. “It’s because you didn’t know what to look for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Something about the books,” Ryoma says suddenly, eyes still fixed on the ground. “They seemed to bother you during the investigation…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They did,” Kaede answers. “Because… I recognized how they were arranged.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Was there something strange about books being set up in a library?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“With this specific setup, yes,” Kaede says. “Because, like I said before, this was a copycat crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sends her an increasingly nervous look. “Kaede? Are you talking about…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tries to give her as much of a reassuring smile as she can. “I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks between them and says, “So, did I miss something? I’m not really following what’s going on here. I mean, if it was a copycat crime, doesn’t that mean it resembled one of the other cases?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “There were folders in Shuichi’s lab that had pictures of crime scenes. Did the culprit just follow one of those?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaede looked through those enough to just recognize the setup from one immediately?” Maki says. “Even if she is obsessed with Shuichi, I find that hard to believe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko cuts in, “W-Well, maybe there’s a chance that’s the truth,” she turns to Kaede, openly giving her an out, “Right, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before she can speak, Kokichi says, “Except that’s wrong! So, Kaede!” he beams at her. “No running away—why don’t you tell everyone why you and Miu knew about the same trap! Ooh, ooh! And why Miu used it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s starting to sweat, but she insists, “You can go over it as much as you fucking want, but I keep telling you it didn’t work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu has already admitted that she created the trap,” Tenko says. “Tenko does not see a reason why we need to further confirm this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kokichi says titling his head. “You don’t? What about being fair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fair to who, shitstain?” Miu asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He throws his arms to the side. “Why to everyone else, of course! I mean, Kaede’s spent this whole trial exposing all of our dirty secrets, so why doesn’t she share one of hers!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares down at him. “Kokichi! Kaede has been doing everything this trial to help all of us. We have no reason to doubt her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You should doubt everyone, Tenko” he says, voice suddenly dropping a few decibels. “Especially since you, me, and Tsumugi are the only ones without any blood on our hands now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Wait—only you, guys? I mean,” he rubs the back of his head. “I know a lot of us tried shit, but,” he looks around the room. “Is that… really true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think it is,” Kaede says, hugging herself. Her hat’s pulled down just so, and she can barely see anyone as she says, “I recognized the trap in the library because it’s the same as the one I used to kill Rantaro.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “You mean the one from your ridiculous fake confession?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede answers, voice still calm. “Everything I said was true. Miu even took pictures of the library floor plan after the murder… they never came up during the trial because of Shuichi’s confession, but she used them as a model for her own plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “Miu was really mean when she came to take back her drone after Kaede tattled on me! She grabbed all of the pictures, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares open mouthed for a moment before turning to Miu. “Hey, is that true? Did Kaede actually make that trap she told us about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu fidgets under the sudden attention. “W-Well, I don’t have the fucking pictures with me, but yeah.” Then her she turns defensive. “A-And maybe I built my trap off of that, but I keep telling you that it doesn’t matter! The trap was designed to let a statue roll along the top of the books to pick up momentum and shit when power bottom walked through the door. But <i>obviously</i> it was a complete fucking failure since that didn’t happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu,” Maki says. “Shut up.” Miu squeaks as Maki turns back to Kaede. “Are you trying to tell us you actually killed Rantaro? Again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “I know you don’t believe me, but it’s the truth—I think the library is probably still setup that way, too, if anyone wants to see for themselves.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says gravelly. “You seem serious, but the fact that we’re alive right now after voting for Shuichi means you’re lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “I don’t know how to explain that—only that Monokuma lied because everything I said at that trial was true… and,” she turns to Miu, “the fact that Miu was able to build her trap at all proves that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have to say,” Kokichi begins. “That Miu’s plan is pretty clever, even if it did come from a gross pig like her. Kill me with a plan that would guilt Kaede into staying quiet, <i>and</i> buddy up to her so she’d feel bad about accusing you at the trial, especially with her track record of protecting culprits. Ooh!” he starts to bounce excitedly, “ooh! And frame Kaito to make him and Maki too defensive and cagey to actually help with anything!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, obviously none of that crap happened!” Miu says. “I get it—I’m a shitty liar, and I built a fucking trap in the library, but it didn’t work so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think it worked perfectly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu snaps her head to her. “The fuck does that mean? If it worked, then Kokichi would be dead as dicks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito adds in, “Don’t sound proud of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, it’s the fucking truth!” she says, throwing her hands in the air. “I had the stupid fucking log at the ready, and when his name came up and I pressed the button on my phone to delete a book holding back the statue, something obviously went wrong!” She presses a hand to her chin. “Maybe I fucked up the loading screen time? Or the trajectory?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re not the culprit because… you just miscalculated?” Tsumugi hesitantly asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says coldly. “I was the one who miscalculated. I thought that Miu would care more about Kiiboy being alive than me being dead, but,” he folds his hands behind his head. “Guess I was wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words catch Miu’s attention enough that she barks out, “A-And what the fucking hell is that supposed to mean!?” she jabs a finger at him. “If you’re fucking saying I didn’t care about Kiibo, then I’m gonna come over there and shove that podium up your pasty ass!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “But… I think he’s right. Miu, you said you were reading the logs, right?” She tries to resummon her confidence. “Which means you would have had to notice that something strange was going on… that people weren’t where they were supposed to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu looks at her searchingly for a moment, then all of sudden she claps a hand to her mouth in absolute horror. “N-No—fuck, no that can’t be—y-you,” tears begin to well up in her eyes, and she nearly steps backwards off of her podium. “No—no, fuck no—if that, if that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede had seen Miu burst into random fits of panic many times, but unlike before, she doesn’t scream or throw out shallow lies. Instead, her shoulders begin to heave as her entire body shakes under the weight of her sudden sobs. Her words come out hurried and nearly unintelligible, “no, no, no—I-I d-didn’t—I-I can’t fucking be,” and she reaches out with one hand to steady herself on her podium as her legs seem to all but give out from under her. The last words Kaede can catch before her muttering falls apart completely are “can’t f-fucking die l-like—like that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others stare silently at Miu for a moment, with only Kiibo’s voice softly calling out for her rising above the sound of sobs. Kaede feels her throat tighten. She pushed Kaito, had she pushed Miu, too? Every word Miu said to her in the virtual world comes rushing back through her head as Kaede wonders how she could have missed this—how she couldn’t have seen her friend committing murder right in front of her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu’s crying hasn’t subsided in the least, and Kaede remembers before how she had said there was no justice in the class trials—there are no ideals she can summon to quell the reality that she is about to send someone she considered a friend too consumed with crying to defend themselves to their death. For a moment, Kaede wonders if it’s still too late to retract all of her reasoning, put her words against Ryoma’s proposal for an incorrect vote back in her mouth, convince herself that maybe she really is okay with dying here in this horrible place.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Maki says, “So we have our culprit then. Monokuma,” she turns to address the bear, “I think we’ve wasted enough time. Let’s start the vote already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze, Maki,” Kokichi says. “You’re so cruel. I almost feel sorry for Miu…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Prolonging this any further would be cruel,” she counters. “As is giving out false hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words only cause a brief hitch in Miu’s sobs before they return, perhaps even stronger than before.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito tears his eyes away from her form, mumbling, “this is so fucked up…” to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands, saying, “even though Kiibo isn’t dead… why do things have to be like this? It’s just too horrible…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut and says the only words she can. “Miu, I’m so sorry…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is no other choice before her but to vote when Kiibo’s voice suddenly rises in volume. “I… I do not have all the information of this case,” he says. “And I know I am not going to get a vote, however, Miu said many times that she would never harm me, and I believe her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo?” Kaede says. “I know… this is hard to accept, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if something is hard to accept,” he says. “There must be a reason for that. I may no longer have my inner voice to guide me, but I still have my own thoughts and my own voice,” there’s a strength lining his words even as they echo through the static of the humble speakers he’s been reduced to, “and if Miu cannot argue for herself, then I will do so for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu mumbles, “Kiibo?” between her sniffles and holds him a little tighter to her shaking body.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t be stupid,” Maki says. “Whether you believe in her or not, what you’re doing isn’t a mercy—Miu already knows she’s going to be executed.” She crosses her arms. “And I thought robots were supposed to be logical about things like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am being logical,” Kiibo responds. “And my logic is that, Miu’s reaction aside, there is still no concrete proof other than Kaede and Kokichi’s word that her trap worked. And I also believe it is highly illogical for someone as kind as Miu to ever hurt someone she cares about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but wince as Kiibo’s words seem to only twist the knife further. Miu lets out a particularly choked sob as he again assures her that it’s going to be okay.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“Perhaps she did set a trap, but she has already explained that it failed.”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“That was wrong of her, but it is irrelevant to my case as the victim.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“I find it highly illogical that Miu would explain her plans in so much detail if she was the culprit.”</span></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“However, he did that many times without being injured—it is therefore doubtful that Miu’s trap succeeded.”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Ryoma has already admitted to tampering with the crime scene.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“The most logical scenario is that Miu is being framed.”</span></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “You’re right. Miu would never purposefully hurt you, but it wasn’t you she thought was coming through the door when she triggered her trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns as Miu just shakes, now reduced to whimpers through sheer exhaustion. “How do you know that?” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The logs from the card readers,” Kaede answers. “They were recording our movements, and I think it’s safe to say that’s how she was planning to time her trap. As soon as someone with Kokichi’s card signaled that they were going to go through the door, she could set it to go off… and that’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko adds, “when Tenko was looking through the logs, it seemed like Kiibo stopped going places after a certain point. And Kokichi was supposedly with Miu and Kaede before going to the library, which Kaede told Tenko was wrong… because Kiibo was with them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what?” Kaito asks. “Kokichi and Kiibo switched cards?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “When Kaede left to get the sign… Kokichi started messing with Kiibo by pulling on his arms and running around him. Didn’t think anything of it at the time, but that’s probably when he made the switch.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does that mean Kokichi suspected something was wrong with the ID cards immediately?” Tsumugi says. “Is he a mind reader? Or does he just have good intuition or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi left the mansion by himself to explore,” Maki says. “If he wanted to test the system, he had the opportunity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances to him. “Kokichi, when you said you miscalculated—you switched with Kiibo because you thought Miu would just stop if she thought he was in danger.” He looks coolly back at her, and Kaede presses, “that’s right, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi folds his hands behind his head. “So it is. You know, you guys are starting to get better at solving mysteries. You’re really becoming pros at this!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With Miu’s sobbing still echoing dully in the background, Kaede can’t find the strength to argue with him, and she looks back to see the projection of Kiibo’s face absolutely heartbroken while Miu just trembles on the spot. Very gently she says, “Kiibo, I know you missed a lot, so hopefully I can clear up any questions you have, and finally end this horrible trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t respond other than to give a stiff nod. Miu mumbles out another apology to him, and Kaede takes one more breath before she begins her explanation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The virtual world was a trap to begin with,” Kaede says. “Before we went in to it, it was heavily modified to remove anything that could potentially be dangerous with the exception of a few weighted statues. The culprit probably decided a trap they could trigger remotely would be the safest since it would give them an alibi… an alibi they would get by being with the person who’s trap they based their’s off of.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Basically, in the basement of the virtual mansion, it was set up to allow a statue to roll along the top of some carefully arranged books and land on whoever the target was while they were stuck in a loading screen, meaning they’d be unable to hear it or react to it in any way.” She spares a fleeting glance to Kokichi, “the culprit also chose Kokichi as their target, and to ensure they would activate it when he went through the door, they set up a system of card readers that would supposedly only allow so many people through each door. I assume their plan was that Kokichi would enter with someone else and then be killed, making us suspect whoever was with him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The culprit also took poison from Shuichi’s lab earlier that they were probably going to use to frame someone since they could also log people out remotely, but when everyone actually went to the computer room, Tenko decided to stay behind, which ruined that part of their plan… but even with that, they decided to still go through with it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we were actually in the virtual world, and it was explained that people could die in there…” she searches for the words for a moment before deciding on, “a few… others made plans for themselves to try and end the game by killing Kokichi, however, all of them would fail. And Kokichi already seemed to know something was wrong since he purposefully switched his ID card with Kiibo’s, assuming the culprit would stop their plan… but that didn’t happen.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We split up at that point, and the culprit purposefully cut off connection between the two groups because they were probably assuming they would activate their trap during that time, however, due to the switch, the moment they were waiting for never came, and after a while, we decided to just go meet with the others,” she takes a breath, shaking her head before adding, “I was teasing Kiibo at the time, so he went ahead of us while we stayed back to search the church a little more.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo then met with Tsumugi, and since he had my ID as well, they assumed they could go meet the others in the basement, not knowing they didn’t have to abide by the multiple people rule at all. They met with Ryoma and Kokichi who had just finished fighting, and Kiibo decided it would make sense for him to investigate the library since only Kaito—who had been mysteriously logged out earlier—and Kokichi had been there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He and Ryoma went, but when Kiibo unknowingly used Kokichi’s card to get through the door, the culprit triggered their trap, thinking their victim would be someone else,” Miu’s sobs hitch for a moment, and Kiibo remains eerily silent as she continues. “but… that wasn’t the case. Their trap succeeded, and Kiibo was effectively killed in the virtual world. Ryoma would enter after him and pick up the statue used to kill him to try and hide what had happened, but… that doesn’t change who the culprit is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a breath, then, “And the culprit can only be Miu. The use of the virtual world, the knowledge of what was actually true about it, the ability to create that trap—she was the only person who had all of those things… and that is the truth of this horrible case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo stays silent a moment longer before softly saying, “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu chokes out, “P-Please, K-Kiibo—I’m, I’m sorry, I-I never meant t-to—to…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words become undecipherable again, and Kiibo says very gently, “I know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma says, “Well then! I can really only listen to whining and complaining so long before I get bored, bored, bored! Soooo, I say we get straight to the super fun, super exciting, super despairing, and super something else voting time!” He brings his paws to his mouth. “And it’s not just like I want to get on with the execution to teach a few naughty children a lesson.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Monokubs begin to protest at his threat, but Kaede pays them little mind as the screen lights up in front of her. Part of her thinks that she’s the real culprit behind this crime, but… she looks up briefly to the others, to Miu as Kiibo keeps talking to her to give her whatever comfort he can before her death.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede touches Miu’s picture and pulls her hand away again as fast as she can, as if that would somehow take back the action.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She has no idea if Miu actually managed to vote at all when Monokuma pops up to announce voting time is over. He gives his usual speech as if they hadn’t already gone over all the details of the crime in painful detail, and the screen lights up behind him to show a unanimous vote.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the sight of it, Miu finally does collapse to her knees, clutching the remains of Kiibo to her chest. Kaede hurriedly steps off of her podium to rush to her side, barely sparing a glance to the others as she passes them to kneel next to Miu. Tenko seems to recognize her action and quickly moves to do the same at the Miu's other side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others have little to say as they assemble in a loose group around them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s voice echoes around the room to tell them that they got it right once more as Kaede reaches out to offer a supportive hand on one of Miu’s shaking shoulders. Kaede has seen this happen three times before, but now it hits her that she is staring at someone who is about to die.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She is also vaguely aware that the others likely don’t feel as much sympathy for Miu as she does—the other girl was obnoxious, insulting, and planning to get away with murder at the cost of all of their lives. However, the person she killed still softly calls out her name.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has no idea what to say other than more apologies that mean little now. Tenko also offers comforting words, but Kaede has come to realize that Tenko would comfort almost anyone in pain. Behind her, she distantly hears Kaito cursing under his breath and Tsumugi fidgeting nervously, but the others remain silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, Maki says, “Miu never saw the motive, so do you feel like finally giving us answers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko whips her head towards her. “Maki!” she snaps. “Do not speak to Miu like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was probably just the Flashback Light,” Kokichi says. “You know, the one that said the world was only partially destroyed, especially since it seemed like Miu was pretty choked up about hearing the <i>entire</i> world was gone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did she, um,” Tsumugi says haltingly. “Did she want to get out to see for herself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The answer to her question comes from Kiibo, saying, “Miu would tell me sometimes about how she wanted to help give back to the world with her inventions… if the world was in danger, it would only be logical that she would want to help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And she didn’t know the whole story,” Ryoma says gravelly. “That there was nothing left to begin with…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “We can’t know that’s for sure either like Kaede said… ‘specially since we’re relying on fucking Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu doesn’t protest their reasoning, which Kaede takes as enough confirmation, and she says again, “I’m so sorry things turned out like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not your fault,” Kaito says with a sigh, “or just Miu’s—almost everyone—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kokichi interrupts. “Why are you making excuses for a killer? Noble or not, Miu was planning to let us all die, even her precious Kiiboy!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is not true!” Kiibo quickly bites back. “Miu would not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But think if her plan succeeded,” Kokichi says. “I’d be dead, and she’d go to the trial trying to trick us all in order to get away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Miu manages, still breathing heavily, “I—I would’ve saved him—I was always planning to f-fucking save him…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “Then you still would have just killed the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s head snaps to him. “Is there a point in making her feel worse, or are you really just that cruel?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stares at her for a moment before narrowing his eyes. “Kaede, did you already forget? Miu tried to kill me. Although I guess it makes sense you’d take the killer’s side. You two have a lot in common after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him as Maki interrupts to say, “That’s right, isn’t it?” her cold gaze turns on Kaede. “You’re trying to tell us that you killed Rantaro again—and this time you supposedly have proof.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says with a pointed look to Miu. “We can talk about this later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup, yup!” Monokuma suddenly says. “Because now, we have to get to the very special punishment I’ve prepared for Miu Iruma: the Ultimate Inventor!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That sparks something in Miu, and she mumbles, “I—I can’t fucking—I don’t wanna f-fucking d-die,” she shakes her head. “N-Not like th-that…” then, she jerks her head up and seems to finally see the others, “s-someone!” she calls. “Someone—fucking, fucking kill me right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her in too much horror to speak, leaving Tenko to say, “Miu, please calm—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu brushes her off, shouting again, “Someone kill me right now! D-Don’t let them execute me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one responds, and Monokuma begins his regular chant, she shouts again, “Please!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can barely process her request as the remaining three Exisals appear, the green one saying in its routine, stilted voice, “WE-CANNOT-ALLOW-THAT. IT-IS-NECESSARY-TO-ALLOW-YOUR-FRIENDS-TO-BE-PUNISHED-IN-ORDER-TO-GET-ALONG.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their red lights begin to bear down on them, and Kaede can’t help but vividly remember the last time this happened in a trial. She almost unconsciously begins to move in front of Miu when she notices the other girl place Kiibo on the ground to pull a small remote out of her pocket.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu?” Kaede says, looking at her in confusion as she hurriedly taps at it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Miu says, staggering to her feet. “I am not getting fucking executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisals begin to mock her words in their usual routine when Miu points her remote at them, causing the red one in front to suddenly seize up.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The other two stare at it in shock, and behind them Monokuma appears to start sweating bullets in spite of being a robot.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I refuse,” Miu says again. “<i>To fucking die here!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her fingers fly over the remote's buttons, and the Exisal pivots to direct its guns towards the other two over the shouts of all three remaining Monokubs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces herself to tear her eyes away to look back up at Miu sweating furiously as she continues to pilot the Exisal like a remote controlled toy. Kaede pulls herself up to her feet and yells over the sounds of the battle now waging in the trial room, “Your remote controls the Exisals?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Controls any fucking machine!” Miu shouts back. “Just have to—shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She screams and ducks down with Kaede quickly following suit as the pink Exisal suddenly opens fire. A spray of bullets embed themselves in the side of Miu’s piloted one, while the rest ricochet off the heavy army. That is enough to spur the other students into action, and Kaede distantly hears Kaito shouting about forcing the exits open over the ringing in her ears.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">More bullets fire, and Miu leaps to the side, still clutching Kiibo with one hand to her chest, while the others scramble for cover. For a moment Kaede just stays where she is, on her hands and knees on the ground, and seems to somehow only dully register a sharp pain suddenly burning down the length of her arm over the chaos.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only when Tenko is physically pulling one of Kaede’s arms over her shoulder to get her to move does she see the streaks of blood flowing brightly against her white sleeve. Tenko screams, “Kaede, we need to get out of here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t respond other than a dismal nod as she does her best just to keep her feet under her. Only vaguely does she realize the three robots now seem engaged in some sort of wrestling match as Miu opts to simply ram her piloted one into the other two.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others have gathered at the doors to the elevator that are still sealed shut, and Kaede makes out the forms of Maki and Kaito futilely attempting to pull them apart. Tenko begins to fuss at her side, saying something about putting pressure on the wound as she rummages through Kaede’s backpack one handedly to pull out her spare vest. She presses it towards Kaede saying, “You were only grazed, but please, hold this against your arm.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows her instructions, moving in a daze. Near them, Tsumugi sits on the ground with her hands over her head, voice barely rising above the screeching noises of metal grinding into metal. “Is—is this what happens if Monokuma can’t execute someone!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her question causes Kaede to look back over her shoulder to see Monokuma wildly banging his gavel against his usual bright red button, shouting about how he will have order in his court.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who fucking cares!?” Kaito yells. “We’re all gonna die if we can’t get out of here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself physically unable to respond, only looking dumbly over the others, casually registering that Ryoma and Kokichi are crouched on the floor on the other side of the door, the former tugging his coat off to wrap around his knee. Tenko seems to notice at roughly the same time, calling back to Kaito, “Who else has been shot?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He turns to look at them, but any words he was about to say stop at the sight and sound of Miu’s Exisal suddenly being slammed into the wall next to them under the weight of both of the other ones.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds her first words after being shot only then, “She’s losing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s enough for Tenko to turn both of them around to better take in Miu standing a few feet apart from the others with Kiibo tucked under her arm, furiously pressing buttons on her remote. Kaede watches almost absently for a moment when she spies something familiar looking falling from the ceiling straight towards Miu.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito manages to yell first, “Miu, look out!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Miu jerks her head up at his words just in time for the collar to clamp itself around her neck.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes widen, and she begins to scream as the force of it jerking her upwards causes her to lose her grip on her remote and Kiibo, both clattering to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">One of her hands starts to claw at her neck, while the other remains extended towards the ground, and Miu’s last shout of, “Kiibo!” tells exactly what she was reaching for. “Kiibo, please! Help me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu keeps screaming as the chain pulls her up, and the screens around the room finally light up in bright neon letters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>GAME OVER</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>TIME FOR THE PUNISHMENT</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She yells again for Kiibo to save her, and the last thing Kaede makes out is Kokichi suddenly darting forward to snatch the remote and Monopad off of the ground before the execution starts in full.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>Ages of Invention: Reinventing the Wheel</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The chain around Miu’s neck doesn’t release as it keeps dragging her up until it reaches a larger circular piece of the ceiling, and more clamps appear out of it to lock around her wrists and ankles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It then begins to spin, and over Miu’s screams, a strange projector seems to flick on, oddly counting down with a slight bounce to the numbers as if it were a particularly old film. The three remaining Monokubs emerging from their Exisals are suddenly raised to the ceiling in the same manner, only to be strapped to the still spinning wheel around her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The projector flickers a lavishly written title reading, “The Stone Age,” as a large rock hammer suddenly smashes against the first Monokub. Then, it switches to “The Bronze Age,” a similar looking shiny and coppery hammer appears next. The spinning seems to pick up if at all possible, metal from the remains of the first two destroyed kubs flying around them as the screen reads “The Iron Age.” A last metal hammer swings down to destroy the last robot, leaving only Miu and pieces of shrapnel embedded on the wheel. Even then, she still keeps shouting for Kiibo to help her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede dares to take her eyes off the sight for a second to see Kokichi standing a few feet away, vaguely angling Kiibo up to let him see what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes dart back up as the projection flickers again, this time reading, “The Execution Age,” and instead of a hammer, this time a large, wide blade like that of a guillotine appears. It slams down hard against the wheel once, missing to the side of her. Then again, on the other side. Distantly, Kaede hears Monokuma humming, “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The blade goes in for a third hit, and Miu’s eyes widen and she lets out one last gasp before it makes contact with her neck.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">If it weren’t for the ceiling suddenly cutting them off from as it shuts itself back down to its usual height, Kaede realizes that Miu’s head likely would have fallen down to them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sheer thought of such a thing combined with the now excruciating pain in her arm is enough to cause Kaede to let her legs completely give out from under her, only Tenko’s quick shift in support prevent from her collapsing to the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears a dull static over everything as the other slowly regain their composure. Kaito starts cursing as he always does, running both hands through his hair, while Tenko asks again, “Was anyone else shot or injured?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a soft grunt at her question, and Tsumugi mumbles something unintelligible in response. But Kaede trains what little focus she has left in her on the sight of Maki striding over to Kokichi and holding one hand out towards him. “Hand it over,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just shrugs at her before placing the Monopad in her hands. “Didn’t know you were such a fan of Kiiboy, Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not, Kiibo,” Maki snaps. “Miu’s remote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi clicks his tongue. “You know, I don’t remember Miu leaving a will, sooo finders keepers, losers weepers!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The remote,” Maki repeats. “Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts to sniffle. “But it’s miiine! Maki, you’re so me—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Both of you knock it the fuck off!” Kaito shouts. They both turn to him, and he shouts. “The hell is the matter with you!? Miu was just killed <i>seconds ago</i>, and you’re fucking arguing over her stuff!? While you’re literally holding Kiibo who fucking watched her die!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The fact that both seem poised on the verge of saying the other one started it is enough to cause Kaito to turn his back on them, leaving the two behind as he mutters darkly, “the fuck is wrong with everyone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As he walks away, Tenko snaps, “Kaede and Ryoma have both been shot—we need to get them as much medical attention as we can now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sticks his tongue out at Maki. “You heard her, Maki!” he says skipping towards the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares, clenching her jaw as she stomps past them, all but shoving Kiibo into Tenko’s side as she passes, and muttering only, “You deal with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede idly stares at the Monopad, noting it appears to be turned off as Tenko awkwardly slips it under her free arm while still supporting Kaede with her other. The two girls shuffle towards the door, Tsumugi bent over to offer similar support to Ryoma a few feet in front of them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The elevator’s open now to take them away from the nearly demolished courtroom, and once the doors finally click shut to take the seven of them back up, Kaede leans all of her weight against Tenko as darkness overtakes her.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The first thing Kaede thinks is that her head really hurts. Her entire body seems to ache actually, but her head feels like the most pressing matter for some reason, even as her first attempts to shift herself as she blinks her eyes open cause all of her limbs to screech with pain.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She narrows her eyes against the light shining on her overhead and is forced to duck her head to look away from it altogether as a brief attempt at lifting her arm to block the light results in such a strong jolt of pain that she barely resists the urge to throw up. At her stirring, a shadow falls over her to block the light briefly, and Kaede has to take a moment to register the sounds of voices.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">One voice asks, “She finally woken up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” the other voice says gently. “Kaede, please do not move your arm too much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks her eyes again, letting her vision swim back into focus to finally make out Tenko’s form hovering over her. “Tenko?” she asks, voice hoarse enough to make her wince.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko notices this as well and quickly moves away to a small table scattered with a variety of increasingly odd things, though water bottles are among them. It’s then that Kaede registers she appears to be in one of the dorm rooms, lying down on the side of a bed with her injured arm propped up on a pillow and wrapped tightly with bandages.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s also then that she realizes she’s so far to the side of the bed because the other half is being occupied by Ryoma, sitting up slightly and with one of his legs also propped up on a pillow, covered with bandages just above his knee. Tenko hurries back over to her side with a bottle of water that Kaede takes absently as she asks, “Whose room are we in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko’s,” Tenko answers. “It’s not a good substitute for an infirmary, but it’s the only place Tenko could think of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Already told you, it’s fine,” Ryoma says, staring at his hands in his lap. “And you’ve already done more than enough anyway—there’s nothing to apologize for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at his words, and Kaede can feel enough tension looming between them to prompt her into saying, “So, um, are we going to be okay then? Even though we…” the end of the trial suddenly flashes back through her head with a sharp sting. “Were shot…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods curtly. “Tenko has never treated a bullet wound before, but she believes both of you were very lucky. From her examinations, Kaede was only grazed, and Ryoma’s appears to have missed any bones or major arteries.” She lets out a sigh. “Honestly, Tenko thinks it was a miracle.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They weren’t really aiming for us anyway,” Ryoma says. “But still with the way some of those bullets were ricocheting.” He shakes his head. “Maybe we’re both actually the Ultimate Lucky student or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles wryly, finding her voice after a few hesitant sips of water. “I’m not sure how lucky I feel right now, to be honest.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a short, deprecating laugh. “Also true.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to Tenko again, “Was anyone else hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko answers. “Or at least if they were, they decided not to tell Tenko and are walking around with a bullet injury.” A shockingly dark scowl crawls across her face. “Of course with the way people’ve been keeping secrets lately, Tenko can’t rule that out completely.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That seems to spike enough shame in Ryoma that he hangs his head, and Kaede sees his small hands curl and uncurl, as if attempting to physically grasp at something to say. Kaede opts to redirect the conversation again. “So, um, Tenko,” she says. “Where did you even get the stuff to help treat us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko perks up slightly at her question. “Tenko was able to find some stuff to deal with sports injuries from her and Ryoma’s labs, and, uh,” she suddenly looks a little sheepish. “She also tried using the machine in the student store room to try and get stuff to maybe make you more comfortable, but…” Kaede follows her gaze to the coffee table covered in a variety of odd objects. “That was pretty hit or miss,” Tenko concludes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko moves to begin shifting through the piles of stuff again. “There are cookies… somewhere if you want any. Both of you should mostly rest and try not to strain yourselves, so hopefully everything you need is here…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma suddenly says, “I’m probably not going to be able to just walk around a whole lot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says tightly. “You won’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She finds the odd, face-shaped cookies she had been looking for and returns to Kaede’s side before silently offering her a few. Kaede looks at them, questioning how safe eating something that had been likely sitting in the Monomonomachine for who knows how long is. With another glance to Tenko, she decides to take a bite of one to be polite before quietly setting the rest of them between her and Ryoma.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They sit silently for another moment before Tenko softly volunteers, “Tenko tried talking to Kiibo a little, but he only turned himself on once to tell her he wanted to be alone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says, unsure how to respond. “He’s been through a lot…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He has,” Tenko agrees. “Tenko’s still carrying him around, so she’ll try and do her best to keep a watch over him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a sigh. “You really are doing everything alone…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks for a second at his words as she realizes all of a sudden that nowhere in Tenko’s descriptions of events did she mention anyone helping her. Tenko seems to fidget slightly, somehow uncomfortable with whatever is being implied. Kaede asks, “Did you… take care of both of us and get all this stuff by yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. She thinks a moment longer before carefully saying, “Tenko… didn’t ask, but none of the others seemed inclined to help…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not really a surprise,” Ryoma says. “After what I pulled at the trial…” he shakes his head. “Anyway, you didn’t happen to spot any of the others while you were running around, did you Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she tries to sit up a little. “Actually, yeah—where are the others anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow, working her mouth a little before finally saying, “Tenko was mostly focused on gathering supplies earlier, but she did talk to the others a little, and,” she looks nervously at Kaede, “they said they were going to the library…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not a surprise, but Kaede still squeezes her eyes shut and lets her head fall back against the pillows behind her. “Of course they are—that… that makes a lot of sense actually.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko wasn’t sure what to say to them, so,” her eyes dart to the ground. “She just told them that Tenko wasn’t going, and that she was more concerned with taking care of you two than anything else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma closes his eyes as he also leans back against the pillows propping him up. “Bet that went over well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito said everyone should try and meet up later to talk things over, but,” she shakes her head, “the others didn’t really seem to like that idea. Tenko was also really desperate, so she tried asking Maki if she knew anything about treating bullet wounds, but… she was not helpful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you had to do everything yourself,” Kaede says, bringing up her uninjured arm to press against her eyes. “God, Tenko, I’m so sorry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have nothing to apologize for,” she responds. “What happened is not your fault.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede lets out a forced, deprecating laugh, “but the fact that you’re the only person who cared enough to actually do anything to help me is.” She glances down to her arm, a wry, joyless smile on her face. “I don’t think anyone could have predicted I’d get shot, but… I really brought everything else on myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t say that, Kaede,” Tenko says quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “It’s true—though, honestly, after everything that happened I think the others are going to be more angry at how much of a hypocrite I am rather than the fact that I killed someone.” She shakes her head and feels her hands almost unconsciously ball up into fists. “I killed someone, and I got away with it—how can they do anything but hate me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t seem to know quite how to comfort her and simply places a sympathetic hand on her shoulder, softly saying, “Kaede…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s back to staring at his lap as he mutters, “How the hell did everything turn out like this…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts again, and Kaede feels her fingers curl slightly against the fabric of her sleeve. “Tenko—Tenko wants to say it’s all Monokuma’s fault, but… we say that over and over again like we know better, and we still keep ending up in the trial room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten as she can do nothing but agree. “That’s right… maybe the mastermind is telling us all to murder, but… we’re the ones actually doing it.” She sighs again. “I can’t believe Kokichi was right when he said that only three of us haven’t tried to kill anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That reminds me,” Ryoma says, eyes still trained on his lap. “The rules state that this game’s gonna keep going until there’s only two of us left, and I guess they get to go free… whatever that means given what it’s like outside.” He narrows his eyes but still doesn’t look up at them. “But if only two people get to live through this… you should be one of them, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko opens her mouth, but Kaede says, “You should,” before the other girl can get a word in. “If anyone deserves it, it’s you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares hard at both of them for a moment before she stands and walks away, physically turning her back to them as she busies herself at the table. Without looking up she says, “Tenko wants both of you to never speak that way again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko?” Kaede calls after her, trying to sit up on her one capable elbow.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She whips around to them, and though Kaede had seen Tenko angry many times over, this is the first time she could recall ever being on the receiving end of it. “<i>Everyone</i> deserves to live,” Tenko says sharply. “None of us should be in Monokuma’s game, and, and,” her hands turn into fists as her voice spikes in volume, “and saying we should all go along with it so a few of us who are ‘special’ or ‘better’ can escape is the worst thing Tenko has heard in her entire life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She brushes at her eyes angrily and says in a slightly softer voice, “Tenko wants to live, but if it means her friends all dying for her, then maybe she doesn’t.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at her for only a moment before she puts all her weight on to her good arm to try and get herself into a position where she can swing her legs over the bed. She immediately winces in pain at the jolt that shoots down her other arm at moving it, and nearly falls in a heap on the ground once she makes it into a wobbly standing position. Tenko rushes over to her, saying, “Kaede, you shouldn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede still manages to keep moving and staggers to meet Tenko halfway, throwing her arms over her shoulders to bring the other girl into a hug. Tenko freezes then when she figures out what Kaede’s doing. “I’m sorry,” Kaede says. “I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have said that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s posture softens and she returns the hug in such a way that allows Kaede to lean more of her weight on her. Tenko also still chastise her, saying, “You really shouldn’t try to stand up so fast like that, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m sorry,” Kaede says again, though this time she laughs. “Except I’m really not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles softly as she moves to pull away slowly, retracting her support deliberately so Kaede can remain standing on her own. “You should be able to walk fine—getting back on your feet after fainting can be a bit disorienting. Just don’t jostle your arm too much,” then she says, “And also thank you. But please don’t talk about yourself that way, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I won’t,” Kaede says. “I think that just… a lot happened yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s true,” Tenko says, sympathetically. “Tenko knows everyone is on edge, but,” she shakes her head. “Maybe it’s naïve, but Tenko really doesn’t want to think about more of us dying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s good,” Ryoma says quietly from his spot on the bed. “I’m sorry I upset you earlier, but I still mean what I said—you’re probably one of the people whose been warped the least by the killing game.” He dares to glance up at her then. “It would just seem wrong if someone like you died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth draws into a thin line as she says, “And Tenko still thinks it’s wrong for anyone to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not gonna argue with you,” he responds. “Just think based on our situation we need to think about all our options.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ending the game with only two of us left,” Kaede says. “For that to happen… there would need to be two more murders, and then it would just be whoever gets to survive and the mastermind…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “That is not an option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” Ryoma says. “But it’s still the one we’ve taken this far.” He shrugs. “There’s a reason there’re only seven of us left. And maybe we’re the only seven left in the world, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They all go quiet again for a moment before Kaede speaks up, “Ryoma, I said at the trial that that had to be a lie, but… you saw the outside world. How bad is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He lets out a breath. “I’ll keep it simple. When I used the keycard, I got a look at a bombed out city before I passed out because the air wasn’t breathable. Monokuma showed up and shut the door. He started going on about how bad it was, but it pretty much spoke for itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” Kaede says. “And it seemed real?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “It did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says clenching her fists. “Well, it still has to be a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs again. “If you want to believe that, sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede insists. “It has to be a lie. There’s no way we’re the only people left because… because…” she gestures vaguely trying to draw some possible reason out of her head. “Because if we were, then…” her eyes light up all of a sudden as one idea filters into her head. “Then how would you explain how the bodies disappear?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The what?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The bodies,” Kaede repeats. “When someone dies, after we investigate, we all go to the trial room, including Monokuma and his kids or whatever. So while we’re all together, who’s cleaning up the crime scenes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks. “Tenko… never thought about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Never have either,” Ryoma says. “Figured it was always just Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But can’t there only be one of him?” Kaede insists. “Like, he mentioned making tons of copies of him a while ago, but it seems like normally there can only be one of him at a time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma and Tenko exchange a look that Kaede knows mean they’re trying to figure out how to gently tell her she’s running on nothing. Tenko speaks first, saying, “Maybe it’s not Monokuma, but it could just be other robots.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But they’ve been so open about all the other robots,” Kaede says. “Why would they only hide the ones for corpse disposal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because they don’t affect us,” Ryoma says. “Monokuma gives information on a ‘you never asked’ basis. Though,” he frowns. “That does raise the question if there’s… something like a morgue somewhere in the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly feels her throat tighten as the implications of her own theory catch up with her. “Oh. I… don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks at the ground. “Tenko would prefer it if Monokuma didn’t unlock a morgue this time or ever…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Have to agree. And you’re also right—he’s gonna show up soon to hand out our ‘prizes’ to explore the school to give us more stuff to kill each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He did hand out the motive when we were first exploring last time, too,” Kaede says. “Ugh,” she pinches the bridge of her nose. “I can’t believe all this time has passed and we still have no way to defend ourselves against him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just trying to get by has been basically the only thing we could focus on,” Tenko says. “And with the way things are… working together seems almost impossible, even if it is to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Under his breath, Ryoma says, “if we still should survive that is…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We should,” Kaede says. “Because,” she summons any remnants of motivation she has left. “Even if it’s not a lie, and there really is nothing left for us outside of this school,” she looks to Tenko, smiling as triumphantly as she can. “I refuse to die like the mastermind wants me to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks up at her with a wry smile. “Your reason to live is just being stubborn?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe it is,” Kaede answers, a soberness creeping into her words. “But too many people have died for me not to be stubborn about living.” Her other arm is aching too badly for her to pump her fists to rally her spirits like she had used to do so long ago, leaving her with only the ability to try and offer them a seemingly confident smile. “So even if everyone hates me and dying is the right answer, I’m still going to find the mastermind and finally put a stop to this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Tenko will help, but please don’t push yourself too hard, especially when you’re hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll try,” Kaede says, “to pick slightly less fights than normal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a low laugh and just shakes his head. “You’re a stronger person than I am, Kaede. Give you that at the very least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s nice of you to say, Ryoma,” Kaede says. “But you said it earlier—I’m not really strong or brave. Just stubborn.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You say that like it’s a bad thing,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “It certainly hasn’t made me very popular. Speaking of which,” she turns to Tenko. “I think I should go talk to the firing squad—not being there to speak for myself will probably just make things worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Ryoma shouldn’t walk right now, so Tenko needs to stay here if he needs anything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll be okay,” Kaede says smiling more sadly than she intended at the other girl. “I can’t always hide behind you. Which also reminds me,” she glances around the room. “Is my hat around here somewhere? I have a feeling I’m gonna need it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko still seems unsure about Kaede’s decision but fetches Shuichi’s hat from among her mountains of supplies and gives her one last hug at the door in what Kaede doesn’t miss as a silent plea for her not to run off on her own. But she leaves anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She closes Tenko’s door behind her and takes a moment to stand in the almost achingly silent dorms. The trial had been at night and Kaede assumes morning has come and gone from the afternoon light streaming in through the glass doors. She takes a quick moment to glance around at the portraits above each door, mentally ticking off how many rooms still have living occupants.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">More than half of them are dead, and as Kaede pushes open the doors to the dorms with her good hand, and thinks about Tenko’s words. <i>Everyone deserves to live.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Based on Ryoma’s testimony about the outside world, Kaede isn’t exactly sure what’s shining down on her as she makes the trip to the school, but it feels enough like the sun that she can almost feel happy for a moment before entering the school. Absently, she registers that the building finally looks completed, which can only mean that Monokuma is just waiting around the corner to shove more strange objects in her face to unlock whatever new horrors her remaining classmates will likely use to brutalize each other. Kaede shakes her head and tries to shake away her increasingly dark thoughts with the motion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She has no idea where the others are waiting, but with little more than a bite of the odd cookie Tenko had given her in her stomach, she opts to first go to the cafeteria. Just outside its doors, Kaede hears voices rising from within. She stays where she is for a moment to try and pick up pieces of their conversation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s speaking softly, and Kaede catches the tail end of the phrase “—still trust her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi responds rather smugly to whatever her question was. “I mean, I haven’t trusted her from day one. She wears pink, after all, and everyone knows that’s the color of lies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What kind of bullshit logic is that?” Kaito asks. “And are you guys just gonna ignore that she literally tried to tell us all of this crap before?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her lips quirk into a hesitant smile at Kaito’s defense when Maki’s voice cuts in. “That’s not the problem. Kaede can tell as many lies as she wants, but when Monokuma lies for her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And she was angry about that!” Kaito says. “I fucking talked to her right after the trial, and she was arguing with Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She was… talking to Monokuma alone?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces and takes a moment to swallow her dread before trying to push one of the doors open as nonchalantly as possible. The conversation inside comes to an abrupt halt as all four of the room’s occupants immediately spin to face her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She forces herself to smile as she walks over to the table. “Good morning everyone, although I guess it’s really afternoon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says, voice betraying the sheer tension lingering in the room. “Uh, you doing okay, Kaede?” His eyes dart to thick bandages around her wound. “How’s your arm?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay,” she says taking a seat and pretending to ignore the swarm of heated eyes on her. “I mean, it still hurts if I try to do too much with it, and Tenko probably said a hundred times that I should be resting. But I can still walk around at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s good,” he says, still clearly searching for feasible conversation. “Tenko and Ryoma doing okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “They’re fine. Tenko’s staying with Ryoma right now since he shouldn’t put any pressure on his leg.” Part of her really knows she shouldn’t due to how poorly the others must think of her right now, but Kaede can’t help but let her bitterness shine through. “Tenko did a really good job helping us—it’s amazing that she was able to do all that by herself, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s the one to respond to her again as the other three just stare. “Yeah, she’s really something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She is,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “You didn’t kill poor Tenko when you guys were alone, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives him a fake smile to rival his own. “You know, Kokichi, sometimes I think you’re pretty clever, but then you just say things that make you look like an idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi giggles. “Looks like Kaede’s feeling feisty today—maybe she’ll be slightly less boring than usual then!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls at both of them. “Leave her alone,” he says. “If we’re gonna talk shit out then we can’t just fucking argue with each other about nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo,” Kokichi says, crossing his arms. “Kaito’s taking Kaede’s side just because he feels sorry for her…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means no one trusts you,” Maki says. “And the only reason Kaito’s bothering to act like anyone does is because he hasn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito snaps. There’s an anger rising over him before he lets out a sigh, only saying, “I can speak for myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes at him. “Then why don’t you tell her what’s going on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He doesn’t need to,” Kaede cuts in. “Tenko already told me you all went to the library this morning.” She looks up to meet all of their stares. “And I take it you found what you were looking for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s fidgeting nervously in her seat but speaks up for the first time as she asks, “So, um, did you really kill Rantaro then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course she did!” Kokichi says. “Kaede is a cold blooded killer after all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “There’s no point in asking that. The evidence speaks for itself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says, shrinking in on herself. “Sorry, you’re right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out an aggravated sigh. “Alright, look—what I did was horrible and I’m never going to make excuses for my behavior, but did all of you forget that I’m not the only person at this table who’s ever killed someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaito says looking down at the table. “Tryin’ to act like we’re better than her is fucking stupid. And like I keep saying, Kaede’s not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fact that she killed doesn’t matter,” Maki says. “The problem is that she won her trial. Care to explain that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede returns her stare. “All I know is what Monokuma told me—he said he would have accepted either me or Shuichi as the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that so?” Kokichi asks, leaning forward conspiratorially. “So does that mean the two of you were in on it together?” He rubs at his suddenly teary eyes. “My poor beloved Rantaro didn’t have a chance…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I never wanted to kill Rantaro!” Kaede says, voice rising in volume.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then…” Tsumugi says softly. “What… were you trying to do in the library?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a good question,” Maki says, folding her arms. “People died over it, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says sharply. “We can’t fucking talk to each other like this—this isn’t a goddamn interrogation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glances to him. “Well maybe it should be. Kaede clearly has a lot she’s been hiding.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I don't.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then tell us why you killed Rantaro,” Maki says. “And why you stuck around to watch us suffer after you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>Maki</i>,” Kaito says, this time rising to his feet and firmly planting his hands on the table. “Fucking knock it off and leave her alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares up at him, expression a mixture of anger and sheer disbelief.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi giggles. “Oooh, Harumaki-chan got in trouble!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You knock if off, too,” Kaito says. “Both of you have given Kaede nothing but shit since we got here, and I’m sick of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says, resting his chin on his folded hands. “I suppose it would make sense you’d sympathize with someone like her, given recent events.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares searchingly at him for a moment before simply letting out a sigh and hanging his head without a word.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He remains quiet too long, and Kaede quickly realizes that she just lost her only ally in this conversation. Before either Maki or Kokichi or even the increasingly anxious Tsumugi can get a word in, Kaede says, “I know none of you trust me, and I don’t expect you to, but for the time being, we all need to work together. We just don’t have any other choices, and being at each others’ throats isn’t going to do anything but cause another murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They watch her for a moment before Maki says, “So your rebuttal is that we just have to suck it up and deal with it because you’re completely unrepentant?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I—” Kaede begins to say, however, her words fall under the volume of a very familiar, very loud giggle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Puhuhuhuhu,” Monokuma lets out to announce his presence. “Glad to see all you kids getting along. You know, sometimes you remind me of my own poor children. Oh, they were all taken from the world too young…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t you kill them?” Tsumugi asks innocently.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves a paw. “Details, details—didn’t anyone ever tell you not to pry into other people’s family matters? I, for one, am a very private bear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you’ll hurry up and tell us why you’re here and spare us from your nauseating presence,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My, my!” Monokuma says. “How rude! I don’t even know if I want to give you your last two totally super mega awesome gifts!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last two?” Kaede says. “Does that mean the school’s been finished?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi, meanwhile, practically bounces in his chair. “Ooh! Ooh! I want a present!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Monokuma giveth and Monokuma taketh away,” Monokuma announces dramatically before producing two keys. “Though right now Monokuma giveth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi immediately scrambles out of his seat to grab one of the keys when Kaito physically blocks him. “Nope,” he says, staring down at the smaller boy trying to get around him. “No running off on your own after last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pouts, puffing out his cheeks. “Geeze, Kaito—I don’t always need a babysitter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care,” he answers. “I’m staying with you.” At his words, Kokichi suddenly stops fighting, allowing Kaito to easily take two keys—one futuristic, one old—from Monokuma. “Looks like there aren't a lot of places left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma brings his paws to his mouth. “Hey, hey—this is just a teeny tiny hint, but one of those keys may or may not have a second use in it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That seems like a pretty big hint,” Tsumugi says, standing up from the table. “Um,” she moves to peer around Kaito’s shoulder at the keys. “With so few of us left, I don’t know if it would make sense for us to split up or not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she stands. “Tenko and Ryoma probably won’t be able to come explore, so it’ll just be the five of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we might as well all stay together,” Kaito says quickly before anyone else can protest. He shoots a pointed look to both Kokichi and Maki, “And I’ll hold on to the keys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okie-dokie!” Kokichi says. “But you and Kaede better not slow us down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes as Maki says, “So we’re all really just going to hold hands and pretend to be friends?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re going to explore the school,” Kaede says. “I already said you don’t have to trust me, but saying I’m not even allowed to walk around the place where we’re already imprisoned is absurd.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki opens her mouth, but Kaito cuts in, saying, “You know what? I think we’re all done fucking talking about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I agree,” Kokichi says. “This conversation was getting to be really boring anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure if that’s the problem…” Tsumugi says as Kaito finally leads the way out of the cafeteria, muttering about how he knows there’s a place outside that matches the strange shining key in his hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The five of them walk silently in a loose parade across the school. Kaito leads them, having mastered hiding his persistent limp almost completely while Kokichi skips at his side and Maki shadows him with her arms tightly crossed. Tsumugi, who had been so happy to chat with Kaede the last time they explored, also noticeably stays a few steps away from her almost as if she feared that Kaede would attack her at any moment. With the exception of Kaito, who doesn’t look back once, all of them shoot her cautious glances from time to time as if she were a wild animal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The more rational part of her knows that yelling at them to stop would likely only make the situation worse, and Kaede keeps her hat low and her mouth shut until they reach a great, futuristic looking door near Miu’s lab.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just gazes up at it for a few moments before pressing the glowing key in his hand into a similarly glowing pillar with little fanfare. The door before them shifts slightly at the action, and Kaede can only guess that it’s unlocking itself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait for it to settle in its movements when Kaito finally voices her thoughts aloud, “Guess it’s unlocked now? Whatever this place is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll go first,” Maki says stepping in front of him. “It might be dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, good point,” Kokichi says. “Harumaki-chan is a great meat shield, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Never mind,” Maki says. “Kokichi’s in front.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He giggles as he skips to the front doors. “I was hoping you’d say that. I wanted to go first anyway!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors spiral open, and Kokichi immediately takes off running inside the winding hallways stretching before them, his arms held out to his sides like airplane wings. “This place is huge!” he shouts back, voice echoing slightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito calls out for him not to go off on his own and starts charging after him, Maki following close behind while Kaede simply takes in the strange building. Wires run over the walls in huge bundles and the floor beneath them appears to be made up of heavy metal paneling. Beside her, Tsumugi just seems to be looking upward at the high ceilings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede starts walking to catch up with the others, saying to Tsumugi as she does so, “I wonder what this place was built for. It doesn’t seem like anything that would be at a school, even a weird one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah,” Tsumugi stammers, obviously caught off guard at being addressed. “Yes, I suppose that’s a good point, though… sometimes schools have all manner of odd things like a giant cage in a music room for example.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has little to connect that example to but smiles along anyway as the other girl opted to respond to her at all. The long hall twists before reaching a wider opening that appears to be empty. Kaede looks around briefly, but her musings are abruptly caught off guard by the sounds of a very loud alarm going off somewhere in the distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi physically startles at the noise, asking, “W-What was that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It came from here,” Kaede says, already following the source of the noise at a slightly brisker pace.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the end of the hall, the two girls discover the rather odd sight of Kaito standing between Kokichi and Maki, glaring at each other from around him and Monokuma in front of the trio, rattling off an exceptionally long list of numbers as his rounded paws fiddle with a control panel on a terminal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s enough to make Kaede stop in her tracks as she asks, voice barely rising over the alarm, “What’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s the one to answer, saying, “<i>Someone</i> tripped the alarm! And,” he presses another button on the panel and the previously piercing noise suddenly fades away, “I’ll have you kids know how much of a pain in my furry neck it is to turn it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alarm?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gestures to a large closed shutter. “There was a fucking blue force field thing or something over this door a second ago. Kokichi got too close and must have tripped whatever alarm Monokuma’s talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is what happens when brats go places they shouldn’t,” Maki adds.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sniffles. “I was just trying to explore… how was I supposed to know the door would get mad at me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says, trying to take in the situation. “Can we go inside or not then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This time,” Monokuma announces. “I’ll let you kids take a looksie, but if you want to get in after this, you had better remember the code, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tsumugi says. “What code?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A really long and boring code,” Kokichi says. “One that nobody cares about or would bother with remembering…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “But that code deactivates the barrier or whatever?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Motion sensor alarm barrier system!” Monokuma corrects. “If you get too close the alarm goes off, and I have to haul myself out of my nice comfy bed to come down here to turn it off, if you don’t just use the code to turn it off yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But none of us know the code,” Kaede says. “So if someone activates the alarm… we can’t do anything about it.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pauses for a moment before waddling up to her with a small remote in his hands. “You know what? Why don’t you kids just keep the remote to this place—turns off the security sensor and all that, but you’ll still need to know the code to get rid of the barrier if you turn it back on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But couldn’t we plainly just leave it off?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma shrugs. “Well, if you want to risk all my precious secrets getting stolen…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re not going to reactivate it yourself, and you’re just giving us something that can turn off this place’s alarm?” Maki says as Kaede hesitantly takes it from him. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can’t a bear just do something out of the kindness of his heart?” Monokuma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s met with a silence loud enough to send him scurrying away with little more than a huff of, “kids today with their murders and lack of gratitude…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With Monokuma gone, Kaito approaches the shutter and smoothly lifts it up. “Doesn’t seem like a trap,” he says hesitantly before stepping inside. “Except—whoa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others quickly move to follow after him, Kaede asking, “What is it?” before she spies two pristine and three dented Exisals all lined up in a neat row. “Ah… is this where the Exisals are stored then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The slowly pour into the room, spreading out to look around. With her hands held close to her chest, Tsumugi asks, “Is it safe to be in here? I mean, the Monokubs aren’t around to pilot these anymore, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They look safe to me,” Kokichi says. Then he gasps and begins to fish something out of his pocket, “Which reminds me—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over to him as pulls a familiar looking remote from his pocket and points it in the direction of the blue Exisal. She opens her mouth to question him when the machine suddenly springs to life, and Tsumugi jumps backwards with a scream.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, ha!” Kokichi says as he presses a few more buttons on the remote, and the Exisal begins to twirl almost daintily in place. “So Miu wasn’t lying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki storms over to him. “And that also reminds me—the remote,” she holds out her hand to him. “Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Kokichi hums before sticking his tongue out at her. “Don’t wanna.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to die?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Kokichi calls out. “Maki’s bullying me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out an aggravated sigh, “Are we really going to have this fucking conversation again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He steps over to them and swiftly yanks the remote out of Kokichi’s hands in one sharp movement. Kokichi squawks in protest and immediately starts jumping for it as Kaito holds it over his head. “No fair!” he shouts.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the remote out of his grip, the Exisal stops. With its erratic movements no longer holding Kaede’s attention, she lets herself glance around the room a bit more, the arguing of the others drifting in and out of her attention. Other than the Exisals, there appears to be a large washing machine as well as a painting machine and a hydraulic press she assumes is used to crush defunct machinery.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her, Tsumugi mumbles, “Ugh, I know these things have safety features on them to stop you from hurting yourself, but just seeing it makes me think what would happen if you got your arm caught in one or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but twist her face in disgust at the idea. “I don’t think I want to think about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know right?” Tsumugi says. “But I almost can’t help but imagine if someone was holding something and their finger was under it while someone else turned it on, and then it would be just boom—smashed it to pieces! Uh, then again… talking about this just makes me think about it more…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah,” Kaede agrees.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her the argument seems to have increased in intensity with Kaito finally shouting above both Kokichi’s childish sniffling and Maki’s threats. “I’ll fucking hold on to it then!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “You’re treating us like we’re children,” at roughly the same time Kokichi whines, “But it’s miiine!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then quit fucking acting like children,” Kaito mutters darkly under his breath as he runs a hand through his hair. “For fuck’s sake…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes. “As if you’re one to talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well right now I am, and I’m still not about to give anyone the remote,” he announces before turning to look to Kaede and Tsumugi. “Anyway, I think we’re about done here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I guess we can always come back when we figure out what to do with the Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we should just leave the barrier turned off then?” Tsumugi asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito walks over to them, Maki and Kokichi both shooting glares at his back. “Probably. Turning it on wouldn’t do shit besides lock us out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right, right,” says Kokichi, seemingly done with his pouting. “So where to next, fearless leader?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you talking to me or Kaito?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins up at her. “Kaito, of course! The only place Kaede has led us to is the trial room.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s enough,” Kaito scolds, sounding more tired than anything. “C’mon, it’s a long way back to the school, and that’s probably where the other key goes…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki approaches him, brow knit with concern. “You can always go back to the dorm with Tenko and Ryoma if you need to—having one less person isn’t going to change what we find.” She crosses her arms and sends him a meaningful look. “If you need to rest, you need to rest. There’s really no need to argue about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Kokichi says. “It’d be really boring if we had to stop exploring to take nap breaks for Kaito, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs again though a bit of his normal cheer seems to return. “I’ll be fine. You guys are worrying about me too much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He starts to walk away again, but Kaede frowns as she stares after him and frowns even more when she notices him holding his side when they return to the school’s entrance hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others seem to notice it, too, but instead of voicing their worry aloud, Tsumugi simply says, “Um, I think there’s another locked door near here, and then there’s also the one on the fifth floor…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Closest one makes the most sense,” Kaito says with little fanfare as he makes the turn around the hallway. They silently follow to find a doorway in front of Kaito already fading away—though the key remains in his hand—and a room opening up behind it. He wanders inside, and Kaede quickly follows to stare up at the large, spiraling staircase.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any marveling is cut short by Maki saying, “You are not walking up all those stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaito says, gaze still skyward. “Who’s not walking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” she says plainly. “You’ve already walked across the entire school twice. If you try and climb these stairs, you’ll collapse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes as he moves to rebelliously ascend the first few steps, “C’mon, Harumaki. I’m not that fragile.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kokichi says taking the stares two at a time behind him. “Kaito’s super strong and tough and never falls or trips or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki huffs and hurries to shadow them, seemingly ready to catch Kaito should he fall. “If you trip him, I will kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But why would I trip Kaito when you’re right there?” Kokichi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s expression darkens, and Kaede barely makes out Kaito’s exhausted sigh as they climb the spiraling staircase higher and higher. Beside her, Tsumugi says, “Well, at least they’re having fun…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a sideways glance and wonders to herself if that is true as she slowly mounts the stairs herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the top, it opens up to a hallway ending in a door with a rocket printed on it. Tsumugi follows behind her as Kaede presses it open, the sounds of shouting already echoing from inside.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room is rather large with a walkway leading to what Kaede assumes is supposed to be a model of a rocket’s cockpit. She spies Kokichi gleefully running around a large sphere lighting up the sky with stars as Maki threatens him from a distance, but she opts to ignore them and instead seat herself in one of the two chairs in the middle of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s practically collapsed in the other chair, idly watching the two of them and seeming far less excited about this place than Kaede thought he would be. Perhaps it was the walk up or playing peacekeeper all day has gotten to him, but the exhausted figure before her is a far cry from the boy she had run around with talking about how excited he was for his lab so long ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wanders off of the path to explore the simulated planet beneath them, and Kaede quietly says, “You feeling alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m fucking great,” he says, tearing his eyes away from Maki and Kokichi to gesture vaguely towards her arm. “How about you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m fine,” she says gingerly resting her arm on the arm rest. “Also, thanks for sticking up for me back at the cafeteria.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course,” Kaito says. “Honestly, I really was just saying what I was thinking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” Kaede insists. “It kind of means a lot to me. I… don’t exactly have a lot of friends right now, not that I don’t deserve it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Kaede, I get that you don’t like yourself or whatever, but I saw you right after the trial so you can’t lie to me about what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know,” Kaede says. “I think I’m getting to be a pretty good liar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito smiles softly as he shakes his head. “Because we need another one of those.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede returns his smile before lowering her voice as she asks, “by the way, what did happen between you and…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito leans back in his chair and sighs. “Yeah… figured you’d probably wanna know at some point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t have to tell me,” Kaede says. “But I think it might maybe help put a few things in perspective.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he rubs the back of his head. “Can’t exactly argue with you there. Although,” his eyes drift to the others, Kokichi and Maki now crowding around Tsumugi as she approaches with a few pieces of paper in her hands. “Think we might have to talk about this later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods and spins around in her chair to face the other three as they approach. Kaito does the same, asking, “Find something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi begins. “I was just looking around and found these papers and thought they just plainly looked out of place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They also say ‘Gofer Project,’” Maki says. “And they talk about saving humanity by using sixteen gifted students.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that’s probably us,” Kaede says. “So… we’re supposed to save humanity?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Well, personally, I think we’ve done an excellent job so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi grimaces slightly as she says, “The rest of it was blacked out, so we couldn’t really read much. But… if we really were meant to save humanity, how did we end up in a killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says. “Whoever made this plan made some bad choices. I mean, inviting an assassin and a robot <i>and</i> a convicted criminal is just asking for trouble.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And a supreme leader isn’t?” Maki asks. “Of course, your talent still doesn’t make any sense so you might just be lying about that as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gasps. “I would never! Hey, Kaito, do I look like the kind of horrible, nasty, smelly person who would lie about their own talent?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito begins to say, “Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Even if Kaito doesn’t want me to kill you,” Maki snaps. “I can still make living very painful for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Haru—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Waaah! Harumaki-chan’s threatening me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you want to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tries to help Kaito saying, “Guys, stop—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki suddenly jerks her head to her as if recognizing Kaede’s presence for the first time. “Have you two been talking this whole time? What did you say to him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t listen to her, Kaito,” Kokichi says. “Kaede only tells lies!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “I can talk to Kaito if I wan—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says, “But if Kaito’s alone with you, then you might try and claim your second victim.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think anyone should be alone with you,” Maki says. “And also, this place is pretty useless now that we’ve found everything. There’s no point staying here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, let’s get a move on already,” Kokichi says. “I already saw everything and this place is even more boring than the rest of the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Honestly,” Maki continues. “The fact that we had to climb all those stairs just to get here is ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, hey, Kaito,” Kokichi says. “Can you give me a piggyback ride down the stairs since it is your fault we had to come all the way up here for nothing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can both of you shut up!?” Kaito says rising to his feet to tower over them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They both stare up at him, and Tsumugi, who had previously been shrinking into the background, retreats even further towards the exit of the room. Maki manages to say, “I was only—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care,” he says sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi frowns, seemingly serious for once as he starts to say, “So you’re not going to give me a pig—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito snaps again as he jerks his finger towards the exit of his lab. “This is my fucking lab, and I’m kicking both of you out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki raises an eyebrow. “This lab is part of the school. You don’t own it, and you can’t kick anyone out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well right now I’m making the fucking impossible possible then,” he says. “Because I’m telling you both to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A deeply uneasy silence falls over them, and Kaede tries to stay as still in her chair as possible, lest any noise she makes draw attention to herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s the first to break, finally turning away from them, her pigtails jerking at the sharp movement. “Fine. You can make whatever stupid decisions you want on your own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though her voice was even, her heavy stomping outside of the room and slamming of the door betrays her anger. At the sound of it, Kaito runs a hand through his hair, though ends up cutting the action short as Kokichi briefly darts forward to warp his arms around his waist. “Wh—hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pulls away from the hug almost as quickly as he had initiated it, only softly saying, “sorry for making you mad, Kaito… I’ll leave.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without a word of explanation, he exits the room with exaggeratedly dragging steps. Kaede stares after him as she hears Kaito finally collapse back in his chair, mumbling curses to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits a moment before asking, “Still doing okay? I could leave, too, if you just want some peace and quiet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “It’s alright—I think I was maybe too tough on them or something. Just,” he rests his head in his hands. “Fuck. I think… I think I’ve found my goddamn breaking point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” she says softly, more out of a loss of anything else to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks up, still running a hand through his hair. “I didn’t even fucking know I had one, but here I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods sympathetically. “It’s not your fault—I think the killing game brings out the worst in everyone, and you’ve been basically trying to take care of everyone besides yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I just did a fucking great job of that,” Kaito sighs. “To be completely honest—they’re both just really exhausting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him. “Both of them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He squeezes his eyes shut for a moment before saying, “Yeah. Like hell I’ll ever say anything like this to anyone else, but…” he stares up at the stars flickering in and out, “with all the shit that’s going on, I think I’ve had it with… fuck everything, I guess. Don’t get me wrong, I like helping people and crap and I want to be there for them, but they’re both kind of driving me crazy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean,” Kaede says, pulling her knees up to her chest. “I’m not about to disagree with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Guess I should’ve expected that answer. But… they are good people and just need someone to help them, though I’m also starting to think they need a lot more help than I can give them. I just,” he sighs again, shaking his head. “Fuck I hate saying this, but lately I just don’t have the energy to be the person they want all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s normal,” Kaede says. “And you deserve to have time to yourself, and they just have to deal with that. And,” she shifts slightly. “If you mind me speaking frankly, they seem pretty selfish—all take and no give.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses for a moment, seeming to have finally cooled down. Then, “I’d give them a little more credit than that but yeah. Pretty fucking hard to imagine talking to Kokichi about feeling weak or Harumaki about how much going to space actually means to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “They were both… pretty horrible for talking about how useless they think this place is. Maybe it’s silly but I remember how excited I was when I first found my lab. I don’t know how I would’ve reacted if anyone had told me how much they hated it. Do you think,” she rests her head on her knees. “Do you think they care about… the real you? Or just the things you say to them? Like, you make them feel good about themselves and that’s enough for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He lets out a long breath. “That’s a good question,” he says finally. “I think… Well,” he snorts. “I think they care in their own weird ways, but, like I said, it’s pretty fucking hard to imagine ever talking like this with one of them. Of course, you’re pretty different from the others, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches her off guard, and she pulls her gaze from the stars to look at him. “What do you mean by that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry—it’s a good thing,” Kaito says. “Like, after all the crap that went down with Shuichi, even though you were obviously upset, you were still strong. That’s why I said we should be partners. It’ll take a hell of a lot more than one person disappointing you for you to break down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the others… aren’t like that?” Kaede presses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “They need more support. I mean,” he looks down to grin at her. “You’ll be fine when whatever’s wrong with me finally kills me. I mean, I hope you’ll be sad and shit, but it won’t knock you down. And,” he shakes his head. “I’m not sure I can say the same for the others. Actually, hell, I know I can’t since I can’t even fucking talk to them about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a moment to process his words. Finally, she settles on, “I’m sorry this is happening to you, Kaito. I’ve,” she tugs her hat a bit further over her eyes. “I’ve always thought you were a better person than me for trying to help Maki and Kokichi when I can barely talk to them. I’m not sure if that helps anything but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Thanks for the compliment, but I think you’d have done the same if you had been in a different headspace. You tried to help Shuichi, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess I did,” she answers. “And I also guess… I’m not the person I was when I tried to help him anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t think I’m the same as when I first woke up in this hell hole either,” Kaito says. “And I’m really not fucking sure if that’s a good thing or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a short laugh. “You know, me, too.” She her head to give him sidelong glance. “Guess we really do have a lot in common.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No kidding,” he answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They stay quiet for a moment longer, just watching the projector flicker between various views of the night sky, each unique in their own beauty.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Finally, Kaito eventually says, “Hey, Kaede—don’t tell me not to say stuff like this or that I’m gonna be fine and make it out and shit, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She isn’t sure how to respond to that and simply shifts her gaze to him. “Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not living through this,” he says plainly as if it’s just a natural and mundane fact about their world. “And even though I know you hate them and they hate you, when I am gone, just… don’t let Harumaki and Kokichi kill each other, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede says, momentarily at a loss for words. “Of—Of course.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s eyes are still locked on the stars and there’s a soft smile on his face as he says, “I know I just talked a bunch of shit about them and yelled at them to leave me alone, but they are good people and they should live through this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She finds that even harder to answer and, after a moment, calmly replies with words Tenko had told her earlier that day. “Everyone should live through this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns, saying “You know what I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But I’ll try,” Kaede says. “I doubt I can just say ‘because Kaito said so’ to get them to listen to me, but I’ll try.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thanks,” he says, smile returning to his face as he gently elbows her arm. “Knew I picked a good partner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spends what is probably too much time there simply talking, listening to Kaito ramble about just how amazing space is and what he would do if he could actually accomplish his goal that he seems so faraway from inside their prison. There’s enough passion behind his voice as he talks about his friends and his dreams that it would be contagious if it weren’t for the almost crushing reality looming over both of them that one day he’s going to cough and cough and that will be the end of everything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She spends enough time just sitting and taking in this quiet moment of peace that she briefly entertains the idea that maybe they could just spend the rest of the game there.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But then Kaito casually reaches into his jacket pocket to search for something he got himself from the Monomonomachine when Kaede mentions Tenko’s stash of supplies. His hand comes out empty, and he presses both hands to his forehead as he says, “Kokichi stole the key and the fucking remote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but groan as she squeezes the bridge of her nose. They both rise from their chairs to speed walk out of the room and down the stairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi must have decided to take his time with whatever he had planned as they only hear a near deafening explosion as they reach the last steps down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Thank you to everyone for their patience on this chapter! My updating pace is still going to be a bit slower this month, but I cannot express how much I appreciate all of the comments that people have written and art they've been kind enough to draw. I'll try to get to replying to the rest of the comments from last chapter tomorrow!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And I also want to announce that there's going to be a bonus chapter between chapters 5 and 6 featuring bonus scenes that Kaede would have theoretically gotten with different items. And I also think that would be a great place to finally comply a list of links to all the wonderful fan art people have drawn for this story in one place--I'll be asking artists if they're alright with me linking their works individually but know that if you have drawn something, I would love to be able to link it here to share with everyone!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s arm hurts with each light jostle as she tries her best to move at a reasonable jog. Kaito moves at roughly the same pace beside her, hindered by his own older wounds, and neither say a word as a series of only slightly less deafening explosions reverberate through the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They don’t need Kaede’s hearing to track the source and wordlessly ascend through the maze of a school to reach higher and higher floors in the main building. They stumble into Tsumugi on the second floor, seemingly as frazzled as them. Between the sounds of something banging relentlessly above them, she manages to ask, “What is going on?” as she falls into step with them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi stole the fucking remote for the Exisals,” Kaito says, not looking back at her in his hurry even as he grabs at his side with a brief wince.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he’s destroying the school with them?” Tsumugi asks, panic in her voice rising.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s destroying something,” Kaede answers vaguely. She calls louder, over the noises still echoing above them as they take the next flight of stairs two at a time. “Have you seen the others?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “Not since I left Kaito’s research lab,” she says. “They might be at the dorms, I think? I guess if they’re there, they’re safe at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw as the thought of having to be concerned about her safety suddenly enters her head as a very real possibility. She doesn’t slow her pace, but it’s then that she vaguely realizes she has literally no plan for how to possibly confront whatever they’re about to find. The fact that whatever that it is involves giant killer robots does nothing to ease the sudden dread creeping up through her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All three of them are out of breath when they finally reach the fifth floor just as the last resounding clang of metal against metal echoes through the room. Kaede doesn’t have to spend much time taking in her surroundings to spy the twin Exisals standing a ways from the stairs. Despite looking a few shades paler and breathing the hardest out of all of them, Kaito immediately storms past her, shouting, “Kokichi!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows him and makes out Kokichi’s much smaller form standing back a few paces from the Exisals and the rubble in front of them. Kaito clears his throat with a brief cough and yells again, “the fuck are you doing!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words catch Kokichi’s attention enough for him to briefly glance towards them as they rush over before turning back to his remote. “Breaking the school,” he replies nonchalantly. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-You’re what!?” Tsumugi stammers. “Why are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I can,” Kokichi answers plainly. “And after I used the key, there was a pesky locked door in my way, which is so mean.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you can pick locks,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, you remembered, Kaede!” Kokichi says, bringing his free hand to his heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses in catching her breath to frown at him. “Wait—did you use the Exisals to break down a door you can already open?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito huffs as he moves past her to try and swipe the remote back from Kokichi, even as the other boy already begins to move to dart out of his grip. “You got it!” Kokichi simply cheers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you just destroyed part of the school for fun?” Tsumugi asks, looking around nervously. “I-I know we were able to open other locked parts of the school before, but isn’t that against the rules?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Still scampering out of Kaito’s reach, Kokichi says, “I don’t know—I can’t remember the rules saying anything against piloting a robot army to help explore the school, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I, well,” she responds. “I guess I thought that was rather plainly implied.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito ignores their conversation to call out, “Give me the fucking remote, Kokichi!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spares a glance away from them to stare down the new, rubble lined hallway. The room at the end of it has its doors completely collapsed in pieces on the ground, and Kaede can see what appears to be a very red looking room on the other side. She’s still leaning to peer at it, making out odd shapes hanging from the ceiling when Tsumugi asks, “Um, Kokichi? Why are the Exisals purple now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tears her gaze away to follow Tsumugi’s hand pointing to the now purple covers on the Exisals towering menacingly over them. Still casually dodging out of the way of Kaito, Kokichi says, “Oh that—see Miu broke the other three, so I decided to give the two working ones a makeover.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what you were doing?” Kaito snorts. “Making them match your eyes or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t want them to match me,” Kokichi says. “I made them match Kaito as an apology for taking the remote. Sooo what do you think? Do you love it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two pause for a moment to allow Kaito to do a quick double take at the light purple covers of the Exisals. He abruptly turns back on his heel then to make another lunge for the remote, renewed vigor in his movements and his face slightly redder. “Alright—fuck giving me the remote, I’m just gonna fucking break it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Noooo!” Kokichi whines in distress, though he still looks like he’s having more fun than anything else to Kaede.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very quietly Tsumugi says, “I know people sometimes name cars or boats after people they like, but I don’t know if I’ve ever heard of someone doing that with a mecha…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a wry smile. “I don’t think most people have access to mechas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems to flinch at Kaede’s sudden attention on her, and she retreats as she softly says, “Ah, um, yeah, you’re probably right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The obvious fear in her voice concerns Kaede, but any questions she has for the other girl vanish as Kokichi suddenly cheers, “Ooh, ooh! Also, I just realized we can go swimming at night now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns back to him to ask, “What does that have to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks. “Geeze, Kaede, how slow can you be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her, Tsumugi mumbles, “I don’t understand? Swimming at night is against the rules, right? So why would—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words click everything together immediately for Kaede, and she says aloud, “There are no rules now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito comes to a sudden stop in his squabble with Kokichi, and Tsumugi’s usual fidgeting seems to simply fall out of her gestures altogether as he says, “Wait what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s… no rules?” Tsumugi parrots. “Why wouldn’t there be—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think back on it,” Kaede says, the pieces falling fast before her. “Every time we would be introduced to a rule, Monokuma or one of his kubs or whatever, would always say that if we broke it, then the Exisals would attack, but if Monokuma doesn’t have the Exisals anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He can’t enforce any of his shitty rules,” Kaito finishes. “But wait,” he straightens, furrowing his brow in thought, “if Monokuma can’t do shit to us now, does that mean the killing game’s over?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, the noise quickly drawing all of their attention. “Well, that’s still up to us, just like it’s always been. Because really,” he smiles, tilting his head, “we all could just actually decide to mean what we say and agree to stop killing each other any time we want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede curls her hands into fists, but finds herself almost helpless to argue against his logic. Instead she says, “The point is that we actually have a shot at escaping this place now—if we don’t have to worry about the Exisals, we can actually explore the school. And there’s a chance we could make a run for it if we find a way out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “We already know a way out, and Monokuma didn’t need to do anything to try and stop Maki or Ryoma from using it…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “I thought we all agreed that was just Monokuma’s trick. We know he’s lied about motives before, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually, Kaede,” Kaito cuts in, exchanging a look with Tsumugi that does nothing to raise Kaede’s confidence. “I know all the stuff you said at the trial about how we shouldn’t just decide to give up and fucking die or whatever without seeing for ourselves, and I agree with all that but… you might wanna listen to what Ryoma or Harumaki have to say about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s hell!” Kokichi happily clarifies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki told us…” Tsumugi says, looking somewhere distant as he face turns a shade paler. “She told us that it was all ruins… there wasn’t even breathable air.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Ryoma already told me that, but I’m saying it can’t be the truth—there’s no way we’re the only people left. I just,” she straightens her shoulders. “I just refuse to believe that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean,” Kaito says. “I don’t think we should all just fucking lie down and die like Ryoma wanted, and,” he gives her a slightly more confident nod, though Kaede’s stomach still turns at the implications behind their conversation, “escaping this place is still our only option, so for now, we’ll just need to focus on that and face whatever the hell’s outside when we get there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nods sagely. “Thinking ahead as always, Kaito—no wonder you’re our leader.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “Now is not the fucking ti—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re right!” he says suddenly jumping on the spot. “Now’s the time for exploration, especially since I just unlocked Rantaro’s lab!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Rantaro’s…” she whips her head to stare down the hallway again, the red soaked room now suddenly taking on an almost sick quality in her mind’s eye.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah,” Tsumugi says. “You did say the door was locked, and the only place that would have a locked door would be…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The talent lab of our dearly departed Rantaro,” Kokichi says placing a finger to his lips. “Of course, some of us may know that a little better than others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him as she turns to march down the hall ahead of the others more out of sheer rebellion than anything else. She picks her way through the rubble easily enough with the others only a step behind, and the oppressive atmosphere hanging over the deep red room almost knocks her off her feet completely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What… what is this?” Tsumugi asks distantly as she stares up at the strange ornaments hanging from the ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito walks past her and brushes a hand over the odd circular table in the center of the room. He mumbles aloud, “the fuck kinda talent did that guy have?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can do little but stumble around the room. She remembers the deep crushing guilt that had flooded over her upon entering Shuichi’s lab, but here, all she can feel is something anxious and sick. The hair stands on the back of her neck, and all she can think is how much she does not want to be in this place. How much she does not want to associate this place with the distant, soft spoken boy she had taken the life of.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “It’s so… violent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems as undisturbed as always as he inspects the room himself, fiddling with an out of place laptop this time. “Maybe Rantaro was a violent person,” he says casually. He glances over at Kaede. “Is that the reason you took him out, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls. “I know you’ve made up your mind not to believe me, but I never wanted to hurt him. And,” she can’t help but stare at the ground. “I can’t believe that he would have wanted to hurt anyone, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi watches her for another moment before shrugging. “Could be,” he says nonchalantly before letting out a whine. “Ughhhh, Kaito—you’re good with science and computers, right? Help meeeee.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs but moves to hover over him with little protest other than a rather resigned, “Stop whining—I’m right here.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi steps aside briefly to allow Kaito to inspect the laptop while Kaede lets her eyes wander the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ugh,” Tsumugi says, pressing her hands to her head. “I know it’s important to investigate this place, but being here just gives makes me feel plainly awful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get the feeling,” Kaede says softly. “This place almost looks like…” her voice drops even more in volume as she says, “the trial room…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Tsumugi can question her, Kaito announces, “There’s nothing here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede asks, moving to stand on his other side to catch a glimpse of the computer screen. “Is there nothing useful?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, like,” he says. “There’s nothing on this computer to begin with, important shit or otherwise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if that’s true,” Kaede says. “Why is it here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe it’s a clue to his talent?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns back to frown at her. “What kinda talent would involve a blank laptop?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well, really I’m just guess—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But can something go on it?” Kokichi asks, voice serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaito looks down at him, mildly taken off guard. “Yeah, I think so. Why—you think there’s a program we need to download or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t verbally respond to his prompting but instead swiftly pulls away from them to approach the towering safes on the far wall. Kaede follows his gaze to let her eyes briefly flicker over the various pictures of Monokuma crudely acting out astrological and zodiac signs. The meaning of it is completely lost on her as Kokichi stares up at them intently.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi suddenly gasps. “A-Ah, Kokichi, I-I know opening the safes is probably a good idea, but using the Exisals in such a small space might be really dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito catches her drift and quickly adds, “And trying to blast open one of these might end up just destroying whatever’s inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very plainly, Kaede adds, “don’t get us killed, Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps looking up at the vaults before finally spinning on his heel, saying, “Hey, Kaito, I’ll make a deal with you—I won’t try and blast open the safes and get our next really important clue right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “But you’re gonna demand something fucking stupid in exchange for not killing all four of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi beams as he skips over to them. “After all this time you still have so little faith in me, Kaito! If I wanted something dumb like one of your space coats, I’d just take it—no deals needed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what do you want?” Kaede asks, crossing her arms. “The Exisals are right outside the door, so you’re literally holding all of us hostage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gives her a sideways look, saying, “So I am,” before turning back to Kaito. “Basically all I want is for Kaito to stop bugging me about my remote, which I found in the first place anyway.” He grins, folding his hands behind his head. “That’s all! I’m sure my beloved Kaito understands, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs, rubbing the back of his head. “It’s always fucking something with you,” he says. “Fine, but just cause I’m not gonna bother you about it doesn’t mean the others have to do shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi salutes him. “Understood, fearless leader, Kaito. I will watch my back for assassin-chans like always.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “Leave her alone—haven’t you already pissed her off enough for one day?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not my fault Harumaki-chan can’t take a joke,” Kokichi says. “She’s been really stressed out lately what with all her plans to kill me, so I thought I’d lighten the mood, but then that just made her threaten to kill me more…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s not gonna try and kill anyone any—” Kaito suddenly stutters, wincing slightly as he finishes. “Not gonna try and kill anyone now. We made a promise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him quizzically, taking a step towards him as he grabs lightly at his side. “Kaito? Are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Super extra tired from having to listen to someone as annoying as Kaede all day?” Kokichi asks suddenly. “It’s okay—listening to her makes me wanna take a nap, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just shakes his head before speaking over Kokichi to Kaede. “Sorry, Kaede, but… think I need to head back to my room for a little while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have been running around all day,” Tsumugi says. “Please try and get some rest, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I think we’ve explored as much as we can already today, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” he says, taking the first few steps away from them. “I’ll… see you guys later then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As he starts to walk away from them, Kokichi follows, and Kaito glances over his shoulder to say, “I don’t remember asking for a fucking escort.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Rude,” Kokichi says. “I just happen to be going the same way with my robot army.” He skips a few feet ahead of him to spin back on his heel, saying, “Not everything’s about you, Kaito—you’re not the center of the universe, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just snorts and ruffles Kokichi’s hair much to the other boy’s annoyance as he passes, saying, “Yeah, yeah, whatever you say, you little liar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs as he follows him out, and Kaede hears the twin Exisals take crashing steps at a leisurely pace down the hall.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the two of them gone, Tsumugi muses aloud, “I’m never really sure if those two are getting along or not. Relationships where both people are tsunderes are plainly pretty hard to deal with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Kokichi is far from her favorite person, Kaede can’t help but smile softly as she watches after them, remembering what Kaito had said to her earlier that day. “As long as Kaito keeps him in line, I don’t think there will be any problems.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi straightens at the sound of her voice, paling slightly as she seems to suddenly realize the two of them are alone. “Uh, y-yeah, hopefully…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says, turning to her. “Um, you seem nervous—you’re not… afraid of me, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me?” she asks, jolting at the question. “N-No, of course not! I’m just, uh—well, plainly, um… I,” she sighs, seemingly done with trying to form some excuse, and looks at the ground. “I’m sorry, Kaede. I’m just… I <i>want</i> to trust you—I really do—but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I get it—I don’t think there’s a lot of trust going around right now anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right,” Tsumugi says. “Like I said, though, I really do want to believe in you—I still remember all the speeches you used to give us about working together and getting out of here, but… it’s a little hard after… seeing the library.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces. “I…” it was so easy for her to snap at someone like Kokichi or Maki, someone ready to hit her back if she swung at them, but faced with Tsumugi cowering before her, doing so feels almost impossible. “Yeah. I’m not about to make excuses for what I did, but I still really do want to save everyone and get us all out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “That’d be nice, but—I hope you don’t mind me saying this, Kaede—you don’t really talk about hope or friendship as much as you used to when we first got here, and I’m not really sure what you’re thinking anymore…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The accusation takes her back a bit, and Kaede says, “I… suppose that is true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean, I don’t blame you,” Tsumugi says quickly. “Staying hopeful and optimistic in a place like this would be hard for anyone, but I guess… I kinda miss the old Kaede.” She seems to notice Kaede’s discomfort, and adds, “Oh, but, that reminds me, I did really like what you said at the trial about how we all have to have hope and work together even in the face of despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that’s quite what I said,” Kaede says. “But thank you, I guess. Though, it doesn’t seem like anyone really believes me now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” she says. “Maki told us the details, and it was… plainly pretty hard to argue with that. But, I still agree with you—even if there isn’t anything left… I still want to hold on to the hope that there’s a reason to keep going.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles gently. “I think that’s a really good idea. And I guess we don’t really have any other choice either, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles self deprecatingly. “Ah, no—I guess we don’t. As long as the mastermind’s still hiding among us, a-and as long as they’re willing to kill again like what they did to poor Himiko,” she shakes her head. “Staying here plainly isn’t an option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “No matter what happens, we can’t lose sight of our goal: finding the mastermind and making them let us out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Tsumugi blinks. “I-Is that what happens when we find the mastermind? Ah, I guess this is pretty morbid of me, but,” she pales slightly as she hugs herself, “I don’t really like thinking about this, but I think I assumed… we’d have to kill them. Ugh,” she shakes her head again. “This is so awful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her words over in her head. “I,” her thoughts race to come up with something to say in response to her. Kill the mastermind. Kaede feels herself grow pale as she wonders, if she had the chance, would she kill the mastermind again? Rantaro’s lab seems to loom in on her, and her throat feels too tight as she says, “I guess we will. That’s,” she finds herself looking to the ground, too, “that’s the only way…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods, grimly. “It’s horrible, but it’s our only option, right? No matter what, we can’t let despair win.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces herself to smile in agreement. “Right,” she says and feels far too sick to her stomach as they make the walk out of the room of the boy she killed so long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The day stretches to evening, and Kaede goes to a poorly attended dinner of only herself, Tsumugi, Kokichi, and Maki.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi informs them that Kaito’s staying in his room for the evening (“Kaito wore himself out playing leader all day, and needs his beauty sleep so he doesn’t get any uglier”), and Kaede notices that Maki tenses slightly, furrowing her brow.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “I was going to take something back for Tenko and Ryoma later, so I could—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t bother,” Maki says, already standing. “I’m done. I’ll bring him something. Besides, we shouldn’t trust one person to make everyone’s meals anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says looking up from her plate, rather distressed. “Is there a reason for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We all have access to poison,” Maki says. “Eating food made by someone else is basically asking to be killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Duh,” Kokichi says, reaching into his pocket to brandish a small bottle. “That’s why you have to carry antidote with you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at the action. “You’re still carrying that around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” he answers. “Why else did you think I took—hey!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He yelps suddenly as Maki reaches forward to snatch the bottle out of his hand. As he protests, she brings the bottle up to read its label, saying, “‘best used to treat odorless poisons commonly slipped into food.’” She turns to glare at him. “Why do you have this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rolls his eyes. “In case anyone tries to poison me—I already said that, Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You expect us to believe that’s the only reason?” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He beams up at her. “Why, Harumaki-chan, are you accusing me of having an ulterior motive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says softly. “Now that I think about it… I <i>do</i> remember Kokichi grabbing a bottle of poison when we inspected Shuichi’s lab, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scowls as she pockets the bottle, much to Kokichi’s protests. “If anyone wants to eat food made by anyone else, it’s your funeral.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ugh,” Tsumugi says. “That’s probably true—I think I remember Miu saying something like that, too, when we first discovered the poisons.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wasn’t Miu reeeeally paranoid?” Kokichi asks, face turning dark. “And didn’t that paranoia cause her to kill?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him. “You shouldn’t talk about her that way. Maybe she was paranoid, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She wasn’t wrong,” Maki says pointedly looking down at Kaede. “I know some of us like to talk about trusting each other, but we’re in a situation where everyone really is out to get you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though part of her knows it’s not wrong, Kaede can’t help but feel the urge to argue against it. “So what—we’re just gonna all live in fear of each other?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes. “We’re in a killing game, and at least one of us has already gotten away with murder—of course we should be afraid of each other. Closing your eyes and pretending you’re not surrounded by murderers doesn’t make you safer. It makes you an easier target.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we should all be ready to turn on each other?” Kaede says. “And working together is a pipedream because things obviously work out so much better when everyone acts on their own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps her stare even before turning away. “If you want to twist my words, fine. I doubt you’re interested in listening to my warnings, and I know I have no interest in your delusional ideals. If you want to get more people killed for the sake of your worldview, so be it, but leave me out of it. I don’t have time to listen to your platitudes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rises to her feet. Distantly she hears Kokichi chant, “ooh! Fight! Fight! Fight!” as Tsumugi shrinks in on herself, attempting to blend in with her chair.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She says, “You know, Maki, I have to hand it to you—I am <i>amazed</i> at how you’ve managed to convince yourself you have the moral high ground.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face darkens. “I don’t have time to care about ‘the moral high ground.’ I care about ending this game and killing the mastermind as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you think I don’t!?” Kaede says, voice rising. “You think I haven’t been trying to do that since we got here? That I’m just sitting around—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think you’re awfully eager to waste our time playing hero or to try and gain all of our trust and order us around,” Maki says tightly. “And even more eager to sacrifice people who want to live on whatever stupid whim you’re stuck on this time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s hands clench into fists. “Well, <i>excuse me</i> for getting upset when my friends die—something you obviously wouldn’t understand. Do you honestly think I’ve wanted to sacrifice anyone? That I’m happy when I have to send one of my friends to their deaths!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>I think</i>,” Maki says. “That you’ve done it before and you’re likely to do it again. I think you’ve gotten away with murder and have offered no explanation for how in the absolute hell that happened. I think you ingratiated yourself with the one person here who may have had a chance of solving the school’s mysteries and killed him to cover up your murder of the only person who obviously knew something about our situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “And I think everyone is completely out of their minds to trust someone like you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees red. “Well, I’m so sorry that even after saving everyone over and over again, I don’t have the amazing track record of protecting people to live up to the standards of an assassin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares at her silently for a long moment before saying, “talking to you is a waste of time,” as she picks up a plate of food and exits the dining hall, the doors clacking behind her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi calls after her, “You forgot to give me back my antidote, Harumaki-chan!” as Kaede slumps back into her chair, the energy she felt earlier draining out of her body in a flash, leaving her exhausted and aching.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The previously quiet meal continues in dead silence after that, and Kaede moves a bit too eagerly to grab two plates of food in her hasty retreat out of the cafeteria. Tsumugi offers her a hesitant goodbye at the gesture while Kokichi nonchalantly reminds her not to stop by Shuichi’s lab on her way to the dorms with a wink.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The cold night air is almost refreshing as Kaede steps outside, though her injured arm aches in protest at having to carry a plate covered in food. It isn’t a surprise, but Kaede can’t help but count it as a blessing that she doesn’t run into anyone on her way to the dorms, though she remains pointedly aware that Maki is likely lurking around somewhere. Though she had never gotten along with her, even just the thought of the other girl makes Kaede feel flashes of some sick, rotten anger. Part of her realizes there isn’t even a logic to it anymore—simply a blind feeling of disgust, but turning over her previous conversation with Maki does little in convincing her to think otherwise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a moment to let out a deep breath and calm herself as she sets one plate on the ground to ring the intercom next to the door to Tenko’s room. “It’s me,” she calls.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits and hears the sounds of shifting inside and a few footsteps before a rather exhausted looking Tenko pulls the door open. “Kaede,” she says before spying the food in her hands. “Ah, thank you for bringing Ryoma dinner.” She moves out of the way to let her by. “He’s still just inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede peers past her to see Ryoma’s managed to move to one of the couches in the time she’s been gone, leg still propped up on a pillow. She nods at the plate of food on the ground next to her, saying, “I brought dinner for you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tenko blinks at it, almost as if she had never seen food before. “Thank you, Kaede. Tenko will eat later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she reaches down to pick it up. “Haven’t you been spending all day running around taking care of us? How are you not hungry?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko fidgets at the question. “Really, Tenko’s fine. She has snacks here like the cookies and earlier she left to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s lying,” Ryoma says from his spot on the couch. “Tenko’s barely eaten anything and she hasn’t left the room since you woke up this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glares at him for tattling on her while Kaede walks over to set the two plates on a small clearing on the still crowded table. “Tenko would like to remind Ryoma that she is watching his health and not the other way around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Just figured Kaede would want to know. Maybe she can convince you or something. Sides,” he gives her a sideways look. “You hate people keeping secrets, right? Only seems fair to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko crosses her arms, still clearly annoyed while Kaede turns to her, not bothering to hide her concern. “Tenko,” she says. “Are you really okay? You,” she stops for a moment to take in the other girl, trying to gauge the thinness of her face and the bags under her eyes. “You’re… actually you’re not okay, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t meet her eyes as she fidgets uncomfortably under Kaede’s stare. “Tenko’s just been busy with other things—there just hasn’t been time to really sit down and eat or take a nap, that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows that that is absolutely not true. Tenko makes a few more excuses for herself, Kaede can’t help but think how she doesn’t laugh or smile or get excited the way she used to anymore. Kaede interrupts her to say, “Then why don’t you take the night off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma and I might be hurt, but I think we can handle a few hours alone, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to Ryoma for approval, and he nods. “Kaede seems pretty fine on her feet—no need to worry about us if you want a break.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko presses her mouth into a tight, thin line. “Tenko is fine. Taking care of you is more important than—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Letting yourself get some air?” Kaede asks. “I’m serious—maybe just go eat out under the arbor or something. And also,” her voice turns serious. “You know you can talk to me if you need to, right? I know I wasn’t around much today, but I promise that’ll I be there if you ask.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks away and pauses for a moment. “Maybe some fresh air would be good,” she says softly. “But Tenko would like to change the bandage on your arm first, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, uh,” Kaede glances down to her injured arm that she was not nearly as gentle with as Tenko had instructed. “Right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They sit near Ryoma, who watches absently as he fiddles with a fresh pack of candy cigarettes. Tenko appropriately chastise Kaede for straining herself and exiles her to sitting at the far end of the couch, her arm placed just so on the armrest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When she finishes, Tenko seems ready to rescind her agreement to taking a break until Ryoma says, “think you forgot something, Tenko,” and gestures to her still untouched food.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For all the sympathy and care she had shown that day, Tenko gives him a rather dark look before picking up the plate. “Yes,” she says tightly. “Tenko almost forgot. Thank you for reminding her, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She still hesitates by the door for a moment, saying, “Tenko will be back soon, but don’t be afraid to come get her if something happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll be fine. Have a nice meal, Tenko,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko looks down at the plate in her hands. “Tenko… will try.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She leaves, and as soon as the door closes, Ryoma says, “What do you think the chances are she dumps it first chance she gets?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she leans back into the couch. “Too high.” She presses her free hand to her face. “I noticed this earlier, but I didn’t say anything—I’m a pretty awful friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t say anything either, then betrayed her and tried to get everyone killed,” Ryoma says. “I’m a pretty awful person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t say that,” Kaede says. “To be honest, after talking to the others, basically everyone said they still want to live, but they don’t really blame you for what you did. And,” she sighs. “It seems like the outside world might actually be gone, at least according to them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” Ryoma says. “I like your ‘people who clean up the bodies’ theory.” He turns to her with a teasing smile. “Gotta be an outside world if that’s true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I could be right,” Kaede insists, smiling wryly. “And, if everything’s gone, I wanna know how they got technology as advanced as Monokuma and where they’re getting the food to restock the kitchen everyday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma thinks for a second, pulling out another cigarette. “Maybe they already had some food stockpiled. Maybe Tenko wouldn’t throw it away if she knew there was a limited supply.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t know there’s a limited supply,” Kaede counters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t not know there’s a limited supply,” Ryoma says. “Or maybe, not not not a limited supply.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a short laugh. “Stop—you’re sounding like Kokichi, and I really don’t need two of him in my life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s fair,” he says. “Speaking of which, though, how are the others? Still at each other’s throats?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mostly at my throat, but yeah,” she says. “I got into a fight with Maki earlier so that was a good choice. Oh, and Kokichi blew up part of the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “You know, Kaede, not to downplay your fights with Maki, but I feel like one of those things is slightly more important than the other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean, you’re right,” Kaede says. “And it’s probably really, really bad that that’s the thing I’m less mad about, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Not sure I can argue with that, but, well, I don’t know how badly Kokichi blew up the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, not that badly,” she says. “I think he mostly did it just to see if he could get away with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he did,” Kaede says. “Monokuma doesn’t have the Exisals anymore, so he can’t punish us. Or, at least, that was Kokichi’s logic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Makes sense,” Ryoma says. “So what’s step two, then? Fight back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment. “I might… try and get the remote or at least try and convince Kokichi to blow up another door for me—if we can take down the door in the library, we might be able to get the upper hand on the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fair point,” Ryoma says. “By the way—who do you think it is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The mastermind?” Kaede asks. “I… I don’t think I have a guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gives her a hard stare. “Not to call you a liar, Kaede, but that’s pretty hard to believe. You’ve been after them for so long, but you don’t suspect any of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede goes silent. Softy she says, “there are people I know it can’t be, but… eliminating suspects is different from accusing people, and God knows I do enough of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Guess no matter what the answer is, it’s gonna be bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” she says, grimacing. “When we find them, the game is over, but it also means we learn which one of our friends wanted us all to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a humorless laugh. “For my sake, maybe don’t phrase it like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede says. “Right, sorry, Ryoma. By the way, um,” she bites her lip, “I hope you don’t mind me asking this, but everyone seems pretty convinced the world’s destroyed, and I know you still think it is so… do you still think we should give up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs, leaning back into the couch to match her. “Don’t know,” he says. “Think I’m just… focusing on what’s right in front of me, and Tenko said that’s fixing my leg so… that’s what I’m doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says. She pauses for a moment, weighing her next words, but chooses to press onwards. “Kaito kinda brought up the possibility that maybe after we defeat the mastermind, the world will still be destroyed, and, well, I guess I’m not sure what we do then. So maybe I’m just focusing on what’s right in front of me, too.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When you’re in hell, it’s a little hard to think of the future,” Ryoma says. “That being said, I still don’t know. Think I’m just… numbed to the idea of trying to find out if my life’s worth anything. Any answer I get will just lead to more pain, so think I’ve decided to just stop asking. And I don’t think I’m gonna try and make that decision for anyone else again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, trying to imagine what it must be like to feel his pain, to have let the idea that there really is no one out there actually sink into her mind. “Ryoma, I know you might not believe me, but I do think you’re a really strong person. You’ve lived feeling this way for so long, but when I heard that there was a chance my old life was gone, I couldn’t even consider it. I decided it had to be a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t make you weak,” he says softly. “And me ghosting through life after everything’s that happened doesn’t make me strong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls her knees up to her chest. “You’re right… but maybe judging people as ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ isn’t the right way to look at things. I don’t know what the right way is, but after everything that’s happened, I don’t think it’s that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma smiles wryly. “That reminds me of what Tenko said—judging people that way is like you’re trying to figure out who deserves to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And everyone deserves to live,” Kaede finishes. She sighs again. “How was Tenko today, by the way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Ryoma says. “In spite of the fact that she still hates me, she did everything she could for me. Though now I have to wonder if it was out of the goodness of her heart or because she’s just trying to take her mind off things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think she hates you,” she says. “I think… she’s just going through a lot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks at his cigarette. “She thinks I betrayed her—that’s why she told me to go to hell at the trial. Can’t say I blame her, though. Think she thought that we were going through the same thing, but then,” he shrugs. “Guess it didn’t work out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“People handle grief differently,” Kaede says. “At least, that’s what I’ve always heard.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. Silence floats between them for a moment before he says, “Kaede, it’s kinda late for me to say this, but back during Gonta’s trial, I shouldn’t have said that crap to you about Shuichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, no,” Kaede says, glancing to her lap. “I know that you were just upset, and it wasn’t really a fair comparison.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” Ryoma says. “Shouldn’t have said it. Can’t pretend I know what he meant to you, but saying you don’t deserve to feel bad about his death was, well,” he sighs, “it was pretty shitty of me. Just… you don’t… meet people who don’t have ulterior motives a lot. They just want to help people or be your friend because they think it’s the right thing to do. They just… want to be a good person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him, and very softly says, “I’m so sorry, Ryoma. I don’t know what to say. I don’t know… but,” and something she didn’t know she had been holding back seems to crack all of a sudden, “I miss everyone who died. I miss all my friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rubs at her eyes with her good hand, and Ryoma says, “I’d say something like ‘they wouldn’t want you to cry,’ but I don’t give a shit. I miss everyone, too. Even the people I didn’t know or the people I hated. There’s so much crap everyone says about ‘living for them’ or ‘finding justice,’ but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a short, humorless laugh, “it all seems like bullshit now, huh? I used to think that way, and I think part of me still wants to. At the trials, sometimes when I figure something out, I feel satisfied for a second—like I solved a puzzle or whatever. But when it’s over, I don’t remember the tricks or whatever logic I used. The only thing that sticks with me is… the horror. How much I failed them and… how much pain they were in when they died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods silently. Then he says, “Miu’s… was quick at least. Was kinda out of it, but it seemed like she probably didn’t suffer as much as some of the others.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was still pretty awful.” Kaede rests her chin on her knees, and lets her eyes drift to the monopad still sitting in the corner. “Any luck with Kiibo, by the way?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “Tenko tried a few more times, but he just said he needed some time. Not planning to force him to do anything. Though, that was the strategy with Tenko and…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “You’re right—it’s a bit harder though when he can physically turn himself off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No kidding,” Ryoma says. “Still, it’s barely been a day.” He pulls out another cigarette. “Suppose there’s no time to mourn in hell.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I guess there isn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s walk to the arbor is one that begins with her stopping in her tracks almost immediately as she spies two figures sitting side by side on the table, feet idly resting on the bench. Kaito’s easy to identify, even in near silhouette, and though the other figure takes her a bit more time, Tenko stiffens when she realizes it’s Maki.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The thought briefly flickers into her mind if she should simply try to escape back into the dorms or elsewhere in the school, when Kaito seems to notice her. “Hey, Tenko,” he calls. “What are you doing out here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, remaining guarded as she approaches, saying only, “Kaede insisted Tenko get some air while she eats dinner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to take a hesitant seat next to him, as he nonchalantly says, “Sounds good,” ignoring or oblivious to the sudden tension brewing around him. “Haven’t really seen you much at meals lately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her mouth pulls into a tight line. “Tenko… prefers not going to the cafeteria if she does not have to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” he says, immediately catching her meaning. “Right. But, seriously, Tenko, have you eaten a full meal since… you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki answers for her. “She hasn’t. Ryoma said as much at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko isn’t sure how to argue against that, choosing to say, “Tenko appreciates your concern, but she can handle herself.” She pointedly begins to pick at her food, saying, “And she would prefer not to talk about this anymore. She knows boys can be very invasive, but—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs slightly. “Don’t worry—I’ll stop. Just worried about you, is all. You’ve kinda been running around and taking care of everyone but yourself—that shit’s not good for you, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko opens her mouth to respond when Maki quirks an eyebrow saying, “Really? So you’re a hypocrite now, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs again. “Geeze, Harumaki—pulling no punches tonight, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms. “You obviously don’t listen to reason, so you’ve reduced my options entirely to brute force.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I thought I said you don’t have to worry about me,” Kaito says. “Like Tenko said—it’s cool you care, but I can handle myself. I mean, I am Kaito Momota Lu—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Has Kaito been straining himself again?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki assess her coldly for a moment before saying, “he has. I understand you’ve been playing nurse all day, so you can tell Kaito from experience exactly how poorly equipped we are if he hurts himself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “Not gonna fucking hurt myself. Keep telling you, Harumaki—I’m fine, right Tenko?” He turns to her. “You checked me out a while ago, and everything was great, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow, unsure what she walked into the middle of. “It’s been a while since Tenko checked, but,” she says slowly, still weighing the situation. “When she did, Kaito’s injuries didn’t seem to be healing right to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see.” Maki shifts her glare to Kaito. “So,” she says. “Are you going to admit to lying now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rubs the back of his head. “Tenko never told me that,” he says with a sigh. “Fine—maybe I’m not in great shape, but I already told you there’s no need to worry about me. And,” his smile returns, “I didn’t drag you all the way out here to talk about me, Harumaki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she says, narrowing her eyes. “You want to lecture me, right? Try to convince me to believe in Kokichi or Kaede based on you ‘having a good feeling’ about them? Actually,” she leans around him to stare at Tenko again. “Is it a coincidence that Kaede’s guard dog showed up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bristles. “Kaede is Tenko’s friend, and she has defended her when she is threatened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And me being in the same room as her counts as a threat?” Maki levies. “If you think anyone missed the way she would cower behind you then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kaito says. “Harumaki, I get you hate Kaede, but your problem’s with her, not Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s eyes flick back to him, and she says tightly, “I don’t know who my problem is. None of us know, and also none of us are willing to try and discover who it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Are you… talking about the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m talking about how we have to be willing to suspect each other of being the mastermind, yes,” she says before shifting her darkening gaze back to Tenko. “Even though some of us have dedicated themselves to blindly protecting the most likely suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko returns her stare. “Tenko believes in Kaede, and she has said this before and she will say it again: Tenko would rather die then be able to believe in her friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you’ll die,” Maki says. “Because belief like that is impossible here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Belief isn’t the problem,” Kaito says. “People needing to believe in each other is just the way things are. I mean, yeah, people might hide shit, but that doesn’t mean they’re a bad person.” He shrugs. “Everybody has secrets—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well one of us has a very big secret,” Maki says. “Because <i>everyone</i> talks about how we need to find the mastermind and how this killing game is horrible, <i>and</i> one of us has to be lying.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says softly, “That is true, but… Tenko stands by what she said. She knows one of her friends will betray her, and that that will be painful, but,” she shakes her head, “not being able to trust anyone or suspecting someone blindly because she’s too afraid—Tenko doesn’t think that’s a life she would want to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “the mastermind killed Himiko. One of us did it, and they’re hiding among us and pretending to be your friend. You really think you shouldn’t suspect everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns, “Hey, Harumaki—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t,” she says evenly. “And Tenko also knows that whoever killed Himiko has walked right up to her and smiled. She knows that,” her grip on the plate tightens. “She knows she couldn’t protect Himiko, and she doesn’t know who else she’s going to fail to protect, but if she gives into her distrust or her hatred, then she’d be doing exactly what Himiko’s killer wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “Fuck,” he runs a hand through his hair. “Didn’t know you had all that going on…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows her grief might consume her if she doesn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you found out who killed Himiko,” Maki says, “what would you do then? If they were to reveal themselves tomorrow, would you let them live when they didn’t show her the same mercy?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow as she returns Maki’s even gaze. “Tenko wants to see them brought to justice—she wants them to be punished for what they have done, but she would never kill them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms, and her voice isn’t challenging when she asks, “and why is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because they deserve to live,” Tenko says. “All of us deserve to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares at her for another moment before scoffing. “You’re just like Kaede, after all—reality means nothing to you if it gets in the way of your ideals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” Kaito says. “If you found out who it was, would you wanna kill them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What I want to do doesn’t matter,” Maki snaps. “It’s not about choice or about my feelings—it’s about eliminating the target and finishing the mission.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And your mission is to kill the mastermind?” Kaito asks. “Listen… I get what you’re trying to do, but I think Tenko’s right. You can’t fucking end a killing game with more—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t have the luxury to think about that,” she says. “I know Kaede and Kokichi,” she sends a pointed look to Tenko, “And now Tenko, too, like to lord their philosophies over me, but all that shows is that they don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow and says carefully, “What don’t we understand?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki clenches and unclenches her hands a few times before saying to the ground. “I doubt you’ll listen, but we need to get out of here as soon as possible—I’ve known that ever since Angie’s trial. The fastest way to do that is to kill the mastermind. I don’t care if that makes me a monster or as horrible as they are or even if it what they want. We just need to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get wanting to get out,” Kaito says. “And like hell I’d want to spend another second here if I had the choice, but… what do mean ‘since Angie’s trial?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clenches her jaw and pauses for a long moment before she very tightly says, “You’re running out of time. Every second we’re here is a second we’re not finding a doctor or medicine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh…” is all Tenko finds herself able to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a low sigh. “That’s why you were trying to go after Kokichi, huh? He was your best guess at the mastermind because of the shit with the blackout. And then… fuck…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “I was taught to do one thing: find my target and eliminate them. That’s how you solve things in my world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “What if you hurt someone innocent instead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it means ending the game quickly,” Maki says. “Then that’s a sacrifice I’m willing to make. And as there gets to be less of us, I have a better shot of getting it right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says shaking his head, suddenly angry. “No—you are not gonna fucking gamble your life like that. Harumaki, we made a promise, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And for now,” Maki says. “I’m planning on fulfilling that. But every second we spend hiding behind the idea that we’re all friends is another second we’re trapped in the mastermind’s game. I know you don’t like it—and it shouldn’t be something you like—but if killing is the only way out,” she hardens her gaze as she looks over both of them, daring them to challenge her. “Then we have to be willing to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Jesus, Harumaki. How do you fucking do it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks, clearly taken aback by his response. “Excuse me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Even thinking about killing someone fucking messed with my head,” he says. “I don’t know how you do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She crosses her arms, though it seems almost more like she’s hugging herself. “I do it because that’s what I was trained to do. That was my life. You mentioned before on one of the first times you came to me that there was more to me than just killing, but… that’s not true. I was hollowed out to become this, and I’m barely even a person anymore. But maybe that’s finally a good thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki?” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shakes her head. “You’ve made your philosophy on life very clear—I doubt we’ll ever be able to understand each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito waits in silence as they talk, turning her words over before finally saying, “Harumaki, I don’t think what you said about you barely being human or whatever is true. I mean, if there really wasn’t anything left of you, you wouldn’t care so much about stopping this game and saving us.” He smiles. “You wouldn’t care so much about getting me out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns as she moves to tug on her pigtails. “Do you… want to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs. “Nah,” and he points up at the sky. “Not until I go to space. Here, let’s make a new promise.” He reaches out to grab one hand from either girl, both of them recoiling at the gesture.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can make your promise without touching Tenko,” Tenko says, lip curling up in distaste.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, come on,” Kaito says. “It makes it official.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you seven?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins, ignoring her as he says, “I, Kaito Momota, Luminary of the Stars, promise that I’m gonna save both of you. Stop the killing game, kick the mastermind’s ass, and sort everything else out as it comes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki and Tenko give him twin looks of disapproval, and he balks, asking how they could possibly doubt him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">So this might be, "serious conversations about the killing game: the chapter," haha. A few things conspired against my finishing of this chapter, and I'm afraid I'm still going to be busy for the next coming weeks, so thanks for bearing with me during this slower schedule!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is a bit confused for a few seconds when she wakes up that morning, but she realizes quickly enough where she is when she identifies Ryoma and Tenko’s forms on the bed and couch, respectively. Her head aches just a little, but it compares little to the soreness in her arm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma and Tenko both appear to still be asleep, and Kaede winces as she moves to sit upright and has to grit her teeth to stop from making any noise when she accidentally puts weight on her injured arm for half a second. The other day, the pain had been minimal, or at least not at the forefront of her mind, but now—after having spent almost all of yesterday casually jostling her arm as she pleased—each too quick movement sends a sharp jab through her already aching muscles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Perhaps her attempts to stay quiet didn’t work quite as well as she was hoping, or its simply the slight shifting of the bed as she rises to stand, but Ryoma begins to stir on the other side of the bed as soon as she’s on her feet. Kaede looks over him to see Tenko still motionless on the couch other than the gentle rise and fall of her chest. The other girl had come back rather late the night before, and after the day she had had, Kaede felt a quiet determination to let her sleep as long as possible.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pushes himself up on to his elbows and looks to Kaede briefly before letting his still tired eyes follow her gaze to Tenko. There’s a silent understanding between them that cause him to whisper his question, “Morning announcement play yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No,” she whispers back. “But I usually wake up before it anyways. You could probably try and sleep some more if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says, moving to sit up right, grimacing only slightly when he shifts his leg. “When I’m up, I’m up. Even if there’s nothing for us to do, probably still isn’t a great idea to just sleep the day away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess not,” Kaede frowns. “But what do you mean ‘nothing for us to do?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I have nothing to do at least besides not screw up and get someone killed,” Ryoma says with a shrug. “Suppose you have your plan to try and convince Kokichi to listen to anyone for the first time ever today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, and I’ll… try to see how that goes,” Kaede says. “But there has to be something everyone else can do, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just gives her a nonchalant look before reaching into his pocket to fish out another cigarette. “If you can think of anything, sure. I mean, I don’t want to be deadweight if I can help it, but, well,” he finds his cigarette and pauses for a moment to fiddle with it between his fingers. “The hell else are you supposed to do to stop a killing game other than just… not kill.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows. “I,” she says, eyes darting around the room to try and find something to prove him wrong even though she can’t place quite why she’s so determined to do so. Her eyes land on Miu’s former monopad, and she forces down the pain that shoots through her arm on her first shaky step towards it. She picks it up with her good hand and gestures vaguely at Ryoma with it. “Well, we can try and talk to Kiibo, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t say anything, simply giving her a rather skeptical look at Kaede walks back to him, Kiibo in hand. At his side, Kaede realizes that trying to navigate the monopad would likely require use of both of her hands, and she quickly turns to hold it out to Ryoma, hoping he didn’t notice her brief hesitation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For his part, he takes it, though still looking at her rather dubiously as she leans down to get a look at the screen. Ryoma spares her one last glance before sighing and moving his hand over the monopad in an attempt to get some sort of response.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait for a moment in silence before the screen eventually flickers on to reveal the normal background of the monopad. Kaede waits a few more moments for something to happen before finally softly calling out, “Kiibo? If you’re ready, we’d like to talk a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Nothing happens, and Ryoma shakes his head. “Don’t feel too bad if he doesn’t respond to you,” he says to Kaede. “After the first time yesterday where he showed up only to tell us to leave him alone, this is what happened whenever Tenko tried.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, still staring at the screen. “Kiibo,” she tries again. “I promise it won’t be for long—I just explored the school a little yesterday and wanted to give you an update.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma adds, “Kaede just wants to keep you in the loop—that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s silence for a few more long seconds before the monopad finally switches to black with Kiibo’s face staring at them from the center of the screen. “Hello,” he says, voice perhaps even more formal than usual. “I am sorry I was not responsive yesterday. I was attempting to take sometime to sort out… personal feelings I do not believe I have ever quite felt before. Forgive my absence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tries to give him an encouraging smile, pangs of empathy hurting her heart at his words. “It’s okay,” she says softly. “Everyone needs time, even if that’s kind of hard to get around here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo frowns, furrowing his brow. “I suppose. However, if you do not mind me being overly direct, I would prefer to simply discuss our current situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Fine by me—Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shifts the screen slightly to face her a little more, and Kaede dutifully goes over her discoveries in exploring, along with a few slightly sugarcoated reports about the current state of the group. Ryoma regards her warily during the latter but doesn’t contradict her, only saying, “So that’s where we’re at,” when she finishes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kiibo says. “If that is the case so far, I will try to be around more, if you call upon me. However,” his face shifts, changing something to vaguely distressed. “I believe there are still a few things I need to sort out… my emotions along with a few other things that seem curious to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises her eyebrows. “What kind of things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is hard to describe,” he says. “But… while I have finished installing the various programs… Miu set up, a few of them still have not been fully elucidated to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can’t say I know much about computers,” Ryoma says. “But does that mean there’s some stuff in your brain you don’t understand?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not quite,” Kiibo says. “However, I’m afraid it is difficult to describe. I will try to get back to you as soon as possible once I have completed my diagnostics examination of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kaede says. “And we’ll try to report in or wake you up when something is happening on our end.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Alright. I will be counting on you then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, his face disappears without another word, leaving Kaede with little to do other than blink at the suddenly normal monopad in Ryoma’s hands. “So,” Ryoma says, clicking it off. “Any guesses about what he was talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not really,” Kaede says. “I know Kiibo had said in the past he wasn’t very good with computers, so maybe he’s confused by it even when it… is him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs as he reaches up to hand her the monopad. “That or he’s lying to get us off his back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces as she takes it. “I guess that’s also a possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do have to wonder,” Ryoma says, “what kind of person would program a robot to have emotions and then stick them in a killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “His creator probably didn’t intend for him to get stuck here, though actually…” she frowns, something suddenly occurring to her. “Wait, um, Ryoma, you know about the Gofer plan, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He blinks up at her. “Only a few things,” he says. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know I mentioned how I found some more information on it when I was searching the school with the others?” she says. “Well, I was just thinking that isn’t it kind of weird that a robot would be included among the sixteen chosen students in a program meant to preserve the human race?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” Ryoma says. “Maybe… he was supposed to have a different role then or something? And well,” he sighs. “If they chose someone like me, chances are they were scrapping the bottom of the barrel anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip. “Maybe. Just… how bad were things before the program?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Beats me,” he says. “Just know they’re even worse now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t exactly sure what to say to that, and finds her eyes falling to the ground as the morning announcement finally starts playing on the monitors. Monokuma seems particularly agitated, practically shouting his message to the point of jolting Tenko awake on her place on the couch.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stutters in still half asleep surprise, saying, “T-Tenko’s awake—Tenko’s…” before blinking her eyes to take in her surroundings.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Morning,” Kaede calls out gently as Tenko starts rubbing at her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Dully, Ryoma says, “He seems upset about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “And that’s… probably not great for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says, finally bringing his cigarette to his mouth. “Guess not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is something happening?” Tenko asks, stretching to a standing position.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to her, trying to smile as positively as she can. “Well,” she says. “We talked to Kiibo a little so that’s good.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glances to the monopad held limply in Kaede’s hand. “Kiibo is doing alright, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hard to say,” Ryoma answers plainly. “Mostly he just said he’ll actually respond when we try to get his attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s posture tightens. “And… he didn’t say anything else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “He said he was going over some more of his programming, but there isn’t much we can do for him there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko says. “Right. Tenko understands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think he wants us to tell him if anything important happens,” Kaede continues. “But other than that, we’re kind of stuck. And… I don’t think he wants to talk about what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Silence threatens to fall over them when Ryoma looks to Kaede and says, “So, what can we do then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaede blinks at the echo of their conversation only moments before. “Well, I guess we should go to the cafeteria to meet the others and… see whatever’s happening with Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko holds her hands close to her chest. “If Monokuma wants us altogether does that mean he has another motive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a deep dread suddenly flood over her even as she forces herself to smile and hurrying to assure her. “Even if he does, I don’t think anyone left would try anything,” she lies. “None of us trust Monokuma, and if the world outside is gone, there’s no reason to try and escape, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Neither Tenko nor Ryoma seem convinced, and Tenko softly says, “Is it possible to just not go? If we’re not all there, Monokuma will still present the motive, but…” She shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t know—every possibility seems too dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Doesn’t help that me and Kaede are hurt,” Ryoma says, reaching to fiddle with his cigarette again. “By the way, Kaede, how’s your arm?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” Kaede says, trying to keep her voice casual. “Though, you actually reminded me of something—Ryoma, how are you going to get around the school with your leg?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “Good question. Tenko suggested using one of those moon buggy things she got from the store, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko huffs. “It doesn’t matter if it makes you look ‘uncool.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma rolls his eyes, and Kaede can immediately tell this is an argument they’ve already had a few times. “You can call me a prideful idiot as much as you want, but I’m not driving around in that thing—and we both know it’s terrible at turning, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the only thing we have!” Tenko says. “It’s either that or Tenko has to carry you everywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Ryoma says. “There are other options.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says. “The moon buggy that Tenko got.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smile as she says, “I really don’t think anyone will care even if you do look silly, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out an exasperated sigh. “I am not using the moon buggy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko crosses her arms, a familiar, displeased look on her face. “Tenko <i>guesses</i> we could find something to use as crutches, but the moon buggy is the best option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Crutches it is, then,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko huffs but complies, shifting through her pile of items until she finds something that seems to be sturdy enough and roughly the right height. She approaches with it in hand, and Kaede quickly moves to ensure the hand she reaches out to help Ryoma finally stand is her good one.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s shaky on his feet at first and clearly in pain when he shifts his weight onto his bag leg, but also shrugs off Kaede’s offers of help, while Tenko looks on with obvious disapproval at his choice as he slowly does a test walk to the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In spite of the obvious struggle the short walk was, Ryoma, to his credit, doesn’t look too worse for wear. “Guess all that training was good for something after all,” he says absently. “Never imagined I would need to be in shape to use crutches, but here we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you think you can make it like that to the school?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yeah. Probably be a bit slow, but that was going to be the case no matter what. Besides, it’s not like any of us are in a hurry to hear Monokuma’s motive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kaede says, whatever short moment of victory had been emerging suddenly seeming meaningless. “Right. The others are probably all already there, too, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone will be in the cafeteria, right?” Tenko says softly, arms still crossed protectively around herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces. “Yeah—it probably won’t be long though, or maybe Ryoma and I could go and tell you what happened aft—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says, shaking her head. “You and Ryoma are both hurt. Tenko,” she takes a deep breath. “Tenko is going, and both of you will stay behind her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches forward to touch her arm with her good hand. “You really don’t have to. I’m sure it will only take a few minutes at most.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, shifting restlessly as she says, “No, Tenko needs to go. She… does not like the cafeteria, but Tenko isn’t going to put more of her friends in danger because of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the door, Ryoma says, “So you think it’s really that bad, huh? That even being alone with the others for a few minutes might—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t want to think that, but,” she pauses, seeming to debate something before continuing, “we can’t know what everyone else is thinking, or what Monokuma will do. And Tenko would never forgive herself if she just let something like that happen because she was too afraid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not afraid,” Kaede says. “You’re just…” she glances between Tenko and Ryoma’s equally somber faces. “We’re all just trying to deal with what’s happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Tenko says. “But Tenko… also needs to deal with what’s happening right now. And right now her friends are in danger, so,” she takes a deep breath and strides over to open the door. “Tenko is going.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows a step after her as Tenko reaches for the handle of the door. Her arm jolts with pain, and Kaede finds herself stuttering before her brain can fully catch up to what she’s saying. “A-Ah, wait, um,” both Tenko and Ryoma turn to her, and she quickly finishes with, “Uh, before we go are there any painkillers? My arm is… a little sore, and I’m sure Ryoma would like to have some on hand if he’s gonna be on crutches all day.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns at her but nods. “Wouldn’t be the worst idea,” he says. “Leg wasn’t feeling great when I first got up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay—but remember not to take too many or rely on them too much,” Tenko says. “Sometimes when you are hurt, it’s important to know when you are in pain so you don’t end up straining yourself too much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, of course,” Kaede agrees hurriedly. “But, um, where are they? Maybe it’d be a good idea to bring some along, just in case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow but moves back to easily enough to fish some out of her pile of supplies. She hands a few bottles to Kaede, saying, “Kaede, would you mind carrying these in your backpack?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances between the bottles in Tenko’s hands and the monopad still held in her good hand. “Sure,” she says. “Would you mind just holding on to Kiibo, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods and they make the trade easily enough, with Tenko seeming to not pick up on the way Kaede grits her teeth when the strap of her backpack grazes against her arm. She approaches Ryoma staring dubiously up at her with a bottle she left out of her bag, saying, “We’ll just take a few of these each and then we can get moving. Sound good to everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t think I have a problem with it,” Ryoma says, still watching Kaede cautiously.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says as much in agreement, and while Kaede knows the painkillers she just swallowed will take time to kick in, part of her tries to convince herself they’re already working in full as she shoulders the door to Tenko’s room open.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walk to the school is slow, though the even pace allows Kaede to cradle her arm and purposefully smoothen her steps without much notice as Ryoma’s focus is just on walking and Tenko takes the lead, already clearly on guard for any dangers that might come after her two patients. Her posture is noticeably stiff, and Kaede has to wonder how much of it is simply in preparation for possible attacks or just to steel herself for entering the room where Himiko’s body was found.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">However, the trip while tensely silent is also a peaceful one, and they see no other students on the walk from the dorms to the school. Kaede muses that everyone else likely only cares about the wellbeing of the other member of the walking wounded and hadn’t bothered to wait for the three of them. The thought would be a bitter one if she didn’t feel so disconnected from it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pushes open the doors to the school, nearly shoving Tsumugi just on the other side to the ground. “Ah!” she says, backing up a few steps. “I was just on my way to come check on you guys. Everyone else is waiting in the cafeteria, and, um, well it was decided that I was plainly the best choice to go see how you were all doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Was it now,” Ryoma says dully.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands as she turns to him. “Uh, I think so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has to resist rolling her eyes at the imagined conversation that likely took place, but decides to spare going over it due to Tsumugi looking physically uncomfortable about going over the matter. “So Monokuma hasn’t shown up yet to… explain whatever it was he was yelling about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head. “No, not yet. We were thinking that maybe he wanted us altogether or at least enough of us since,” she hugs her arm. “If three people are missing… that’s basically half of us now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but feel her heart sink slightly at the observation as Tenko starts to ask, “So that is all that we need to do. Just go in there, listen to Monokuma’s announcement and leave?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “I think so? But, well, he plainly always kind of likes to do something weird to mess with us or cause trouble, so I don’t really know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We could just not go then,” Ryoma says. “If he won’t give it if we’re not there, then isn’t the best option to just not show up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “I don’t know about that. Trying to just ignore the motive before… hasn’t really worked out for us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede sighs. “It hasn’t.” She forces herself to smile as confidently as she can. “I guess we’ll just have to actually work as a team this time and face it head on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words feel so fake as she says them, but none of the others seem to notice with Tsumugi saying, “Right, I guess that is all we can do now. Yup,” she nods, seeming to gain some confidence. “The only thing to do is to do it, and… I’m sure it will all plainly work out because,” her smile turns sad, “we… don’t really have any other options, do we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We either listen to Monokuma or we die,” Ryoma sighs. “So, yeah. Guess that’s our only choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko still has her jaw clenched as she says again, “We just have to go, hear what he has to say, and then leave and… not do whatever it is he says. Got it,” she nods to herself. “Got it—Tenko understands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Are you okay, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” she says quickly. “Yes—Tenko can… Tenko can do this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, well,” Tsumugi says. “Everyone else is waiting so we should probably get going. I know Monokuma sounded pretty mad earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks to herself that there’s also a chance Kokichi and Maki might tear Kaito in half if they take too long. With nervous eyes still on Tenko’s stiff form, she says, “Alright—you lead the way then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods and starts off, followed by Tenko who adds over her shoulder, “Remember to stay close to Tenko in case anything happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Once she turns around again, Kaede exchanges a brief look with Ryoma as they trail after them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi offers them all a hesitant but supportive smile as she presses the doors open, and Kaede can see Tenko clenching her hands into fists as she steps through the doorway. Kaede catches the door to hold it up and gestures for Ryoma to go in front of her as she observes the others from over his head.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s of little surprise that Kaito is sitting between Maki and Kokichi at the table, and while he seems to be smiling, Kaede thinks she can see something similar to her own forced cheer in his expression. And with that in mind, to her, he appears to be somewhat cooled down from the day before but still exhausted.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Tenko,” he says. “You coming to eat with us today, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stays close to the doors even as Tsumugi settles back at the table and Ryoma shuffles around her to reach one of the chairs. “No,” she says tightly. “Tenko just wanted to stay with Kaede and Ryoma. That’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Maki quirks an eyebrow, saying, “Is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something in Tenko’s gaze changes, and Kaede suddenly becomes very aware that she has no idea what unspoken thought is passing between them. Kaito comes to their rescue, adding, “Just looking after your patients, right Tenko? Maybe you’re actually the Ultimate Nurse or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Some of the tension seems to fall away as Tenko shifts to address him. “No, Tenko does not have nearly enough medical training for that. And even if she did, she is still having trouble getting one awful boy to actually let her attend to his injuries.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs, holding up his hands in defeat. “Got it—got it. But, seriously, Tenko—everyone—you don’t have to waste time worrying about me. You guys should be directing that energy somewhere else—like figuring out how to get us the hell out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s eyes flick to him. “Why are you talking about it like that? It’s not an either or situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Look,” he shakes his head. “All I’m fucking saying is just,” he gestures vaguely as if trying to summon some coherent argument. “There’s no reason to focus on me, alright? It isn’t gonna get us anywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, well,” Tsumugi says. “I guess that is kind of true. If someone is hurt, helping them is important, but we’re just treating the symptoms and not… curing the disease, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “That does… sort of make sense. We’ve just been running on band aid solutions because that’s all we have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others go quiet, and Kaede’s half expecting Monokuma to show up to try and startle them out of silence when she hears Kaito say, “Hey, Kokichi, you got really quiet all of a sudden. Something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi says, glancing up at him. “Oh me? No, I,” he leans back in his chair and sighs dramatically. “I was just busy getting lost in your eyes—that’s all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes and pinches the bridge of his nose. “I know you’re capable of being serious, so could you do that for like five fucking seconds?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not right now,” he says easily, folding his hands behind his head. “Especially since everyone’s getting all mopey for no reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks at him from across the table, his eyes hooded by his hat. “There are seven of us left, and we might be the last survivors of humanity. Don’t think that’s a reason to feel like shit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Well, if you’re gonna look at it from that angle, sure, then you might throw yourself a pity party or two. Personally, though, I think I’d rather get mad then cry. I’m waaaay more fun when I’m angry, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is any of that supposed to mean anything?” Maki asks, narrowing her eyes. “Or are you just complaining that we’re not being interesting enough for your game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi simply tilts his head, and Kaede sees Kaito open his mouth to say something back to her when Monokuma decides to take that as his cue to suddenly appear seemingly out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, well, well, you brats sure took your time—reminds me of a few tragically deceased kids of mine. But, oh well, nobody really cares about stale comic relief like them,” he says casually. “Everyone knows you kids are the real stars here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Why are you talking about it like that? Who is ‘everyone?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It,” Tsumugi says, nervously wringing her hands. “It has to be us, right? If we’re plainly the only ones left then ‘everyone’ is us. So… we know we’re the stars?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The fuck does that mean?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who knows!” Monokuma says. “And personally I am not in the mood for interruptions right now.” His gaze darkens as he brandishes one of his paws. “I know the secret of the outside world can be kind of a buzzkill, but that’s no reason to run around trying to break my game like a certain smartass here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi leans over Kaito to stage whisper to Maki, “Maki, he’s talking about you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes. “So what—you’re going to punish us because Kokichi destroyed something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if you didn’t want him to do that,” Ryoma says, “couldn’t you have just told him to knock it off before?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Because,” she gives Kokichi a sideways look as she says. “Because without the Exisals, Monokuma can’t enforce his rules, which means we’re free to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bzzzt!” Monokuma says. “Wrong, wrong, wrongy wrong! What kind of game master would I be if I couldn’t have my rules?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shifts to lean forward, propping his chin up with one bored hand as if he were about to say something, but—to Kaede’s surprise—he remains silent, simply watching Monokuma through half lidded eyes. Beside him, Kaito speaks instead, saying, “None of us fucking gave a damn about your shitty rules in the first place. The fact that we don’t have to follow them anymore just means—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also wrong!” Monokuma says. “And, see, it’s attitudes like that that really grind my gears, you know? But I guess I just have to accept that some people in life are just ungrateful no matter what you do for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls as he moves to his feet, slamming both his hands on the table. “Would you shut your fucking mouth—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Tenko asks suddenly. “Why do you keep saying we’re wrong about there not being any rules? You don’t have the Exisals anymore so…” she seems to suddenly become aware of everyone’s eyes on her, and her voice softens as she continues. “So Tenko doesn’t understand. You can’t just threaten us anymore, and the world is gone so all we have is each other… and Tenko wants to believe that none of her friends—no one in the world—would try to keep killing and hurting each other when that’s all we have left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gently reaches out to touch her arm comfortingly. “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “You can’t do anything to us anymore, and no one would want to escape into such a horrible world, so the killing game has to be over now, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma observes them for a moment before bringing both his paws up to his mouth. “Puhuhuhu… those sure were some touching words and some wonderfully delicious false hope, but I personally have always thought a joke is at its funniest when someone believes in it with all their heart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A joke,” Kaede says. “A joke—what,” she distantly begins to hear her voice rise in volume, almost as if she wasn’t in control of it at all. “What about this is a <i>fucking</i> joke!? You’re going to make us suffer more!? You’re going to try and make us hurt each other because you enjoy toying with us!? You—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The new motive,” Monokuma says. “Is a bit of a rehash, I’ll admit, but I also have to admit I sorta put all my eggs in one despairful basket with handing you kids a chance to learn the secret of the outside world. My bad on that one, guys. So I hope you’ll all find it in your hearts to forgive me, and won’t think your second time limit is too boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels the anger that had been controlling her body vanish in an instant, leaving her feeling nothing but hollow at his words. “The… the what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma closes his eyes. “Another time limit—and guess we can assume you’ll kill us all at the end of it if there isn’t a murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup,” he says. “Despairfully predictable, I know, but I think it’s important to put a little more fear back in you, you know? Since, after all, I might not have the Exisals anymore, but I still have my old trump card of making an entire army of me after, oh,” he hums to himself as he takes a moment to look over their faces. “I’m feeling generous all of a sudden. Instead of two days this time, you guys get three days! Just to mix things up a little. But after that, everyone forced into the killing game will face my wrath! Or a clone of me’s wrath. Or a clone of a clone of me’s wrath. Depends how many spares I go through between then and now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can do little as the absolute horror she had felt so long ago surges through her. Her stomach twists in knots, and she feels something vile and sick rising in her throat, and she shifts her weight onto Tenko, knowing her legs might just give out from under her at any moment. But, still, through it all, one shining piece of his speech stands out to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She remembers standing in the dusty library, talking to Shuichi, who had brought his hand to his chin and said, “‘everyone forced into the killing game.’ Why did he phrase it like that? Doesn’t it seem like a loophole or something to his rules?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And now despite the sharp, sour sickness rising over her, Kaede echoes, “Everyone forced into the killing game…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Distantly, she hears a slight sound of someone shifting at the table as if suddenly perking up in attention, though she pays it little heed. Through gritted teeth, Kaito says, “Shut up! Like hell are you gonna—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Like hell?’” Monokuma says. “Well, I suppose some would say we’re in hell, but personally I just think we’re in my world. And in Monokuma’s world—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you to shut up!” Kaito yells, slamming his hands against the table again. “It doesn’t matter what you do to us. None of us are going to play your fucking games anymore!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma simply raises a paw. “Then you can all die together. Continue the game or give me the pleasure of slaughtering you all now—and I have to admit, I don’t really care either way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi holds her head in her hands. “Why is this happening again? W-We promise we won’t use the Exisals again if you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Negotiating with him is pointless,” Maki says. “He wouldn’t be inflicting a motive like this on us again if it was possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right you are,” Monokuma says. “Well, I think that just about does it for me. You kids have fun and make sure to bring me a corpse in three days! Or else <i>I’ll</i> get to have some fun! Puhuhuhu!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his last laugh at their horror, Monokuma fades away as strangely as he had appeared leaving the room deathly quiet in his wake.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure if the feeling overwhelming her makes her want to faint, vomit, or possibly both. It’s all she can do in the moment to briefly take in the variety of expressions on the other’s faces as their current situation sinks in. Tenko mostly seems concerned about her while Ryoma stares at the ground with half lidded eyes, and Tsumugi sits in the chair next to him, cradling her head as if doing so could protect her from the motive.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki and Kokichi both appear relatively calm with their twin blank expressions as Kaito finally breaks the spell over them by awkwardly stepping away from the table altogether to stand in the center of the group. “Alright,” he says. “So—this means one thing and one fucking thing only. We are fucking fighting back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We are?” Tsumugi asks meekly. “I mean, I want to if I could, but doesn’t it seem plainly impossible?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The impossible is possible if you make it so,” Kokichi says rather dully, absently tracing patterns on the tabletop with one pale finger. “Isn’t that something you’d say, Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t need motivational speeches,” Ryoma says without looking up. “Positive words and good feelings aren’t about to keep us alive when the time limit ends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why,” Kaito says, “We need to work together and think of a plan. There’s absolutely no way in hell we’re just gonna sit on our asses and ignore this. I’d die before I let what happened last time happen again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without any emotion in her voice, Maki says, “Last time, Kaede killed Rantaro.” Her cold words snap Kaede to attention as she continues. “To stop history from repeating itse—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m never going to let anything like that happen again,” Kaede hisses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what are you going to do?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m going to,” Kaede clenches and unclenches her hands, the slight movement shooting an almost clarifying pain up her arm. “I’m going to think of something with everyone and stop this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop what?” Kokichi asks suddenly. “Stop the time limit? Or stop someone from committing murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waves her good hand vaguely. “Both, obviously.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last time,” Tenko says quietly. “Our only plan was to try and fight back, but we never got that far into the strategy meeting because Rantaro wandered off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a deep sigh. “But this time’ll be different. We’re gonna fucking learn from our mistakes and figure something out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Ryoma says, finally looking up. “Any suggestions then? Know we have the Exisals, but,” he glances over the others. “Trying to run isn’t gonna do much good, is it? There’s no air outside of the dome even if we do manage to find a way to escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki casually brushes her hair over her shoulder, almost nonchalant as she adds, “Attempting to fight head on would be suicide. An initial confrontation might not end with all of us dead, but we’re in a situation where our opponent is observing everything we say and do. Surprising or tricking them would be impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “Surprising Monokuma isn’t the only way to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And between the seven of us,” Maki says. “Tenko is weak from starving herself, Kaito can’t run, Ryoma can’t walk, and Kaede can’t use one of her arms. And I doubt Kokichi or Tsumugi have ever handled a serious weapon in their lives.” She briefly lets her gaze move over each of them. “You’re all blatant liabilities in a best case scenario.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not a fucking liability,” Kaito says. “Because I don’t care—I’m gonna go down fighting, and that’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one is—!” Tenko shouts before suddenly becoming aware of her outburst. “No one is… ‘going down’ doing anything because,” she shakes her head. “If the plan is for someone to sacrifice themselves fighting Monokuma, then Tenko wants nothing to do with it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs, running a hand through his hair as he turns to her. “I’m not saying we should all plan to just charge in and fucking die but just that we have to do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We do,” Tenko says. “But… but if our only options are to die horribly fighting against Monokuma or—or just choose one of our friends to kill, then Tenko would rather we just let the time limit expire.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says. “But if we did that, we’d all die anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone forced into the killing game would die,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s head snaps to look at him, and he simply tilts his head at her in return. She keeps watching him, furrowing her brow, as Maki says, “Choosing someone to die is the most pragmatic option. Of course, it’s just a stall since there’s nothing stopping Monokuma from just enforcing another time limit on us afterwards.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Until there are two,” Ryoma says. “That’s the only way this game ends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Only if we don’t do something right fucking now,” Kaito insists. “C’mon guys—what the hell is wrong with you? We have no other choices here. We work together and we fight back. I’m telling you, that’s the only possibility there is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or,” Kokichi says, only breaking eye contact with Kaede to spare Kaito a glance. “We could do Tenko’s plan and let time expire and see what happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘S-See what happens!?” Tsumugi stammers. “W-We all die! That’s what Monokuma said plainly happens!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives him an odd look. “What are you…” he trails off, shaking his head as if trying to clear away whatever about Kokichi’s words was bothering him. “Anyway—Monokuma thinks this’ll work because one of us will try and betray us or take matters into their own hands or some shit. The only way we win this is if we work together and believe in each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs, and Kaede sees something she would think was almost pained if it wasn’t in Maki’s expression. “Believing in each other is impossible because right now, the mastermind is in this room.” The others fall quiet as she continues. “We can’t make plans as a group because one of us is going to betray us or do something to sabotage it or whatever needs to happen to make sure we fail.” She shakes her head. “Those are just the facts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaito says. “I know, and I still say we fight.” He presses his fists together. “I don’t care what happens or what the odds are. I’m gonna do whatever it fucking takes to protect you guys, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kokichi says, happily swinging his legs back and forth under the table. “What will it take then? C’mon, what’s the plan, commander Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns as his gaze slides back to him. “Well, let’s think about what we got. And,” he turns to Maki. “I know we’re being watched and shit, but all that means is that, you know, it’s just gotta be a really fucking good plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes, but doesn’t seem entirely upset at the sentiment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Speaking of being watched,” Ryoma says, pulling a cigarette out of his pocket. “Maki brought this up earlier, and have to admit I haven’t seen much of a reason to explain since the fact that Monokuma’s monitoring us somehow is obvious, but,” he sighs. “While back, Gonta and I figured out how it was happening… and the mastermind obviously didn’t like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Tenko says softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends her a brief sympathetic look before turning back to Ryoma. “That’s why the mastermind tried to target the two of you in the past cases… because they wanted to keep it secret, but with their rules, they couldn’t do anything about it outright without getting punished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what I figured,” Ryoma says. “Also these days Tenko’s been watching me like a hawk. Doubt anyone could come near me if they wanted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Tenko has been—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” he says, looking up at her. “And I’m grateful—I really am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares hard at him for a moment before saying, “Fine. Ryoma, if you tell us now when everyone is present, the mastermind cannot do anything. So…” she looks to the others for quick reassurance. “How are we being watched?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma fiddles with his cigarette for a moment, seeming to contemplate how to phrase his next words. “Gonta,” he says after a few seconds. “His vision was… ridiculous—he noticed these things buzzing around that none of us could see and assumed they were bugs, but,” he sighs. “He was too slow to catch them until I offered to help. We didn’t even know what the hell we were doing when we started, but he’d point out where one of them was, and I’d use my flash stepping to try and catch it. And we got a few.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bugs?” Kaede says. “I… remember you guys—wait. That one night, when Tenko and I were walking back to the dorms and we saw you guys. Were you catching them then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Ryoma says. “And once I got a hold of a few, Gonta was able to get a better look.” He shakes his head. “Course it was still hell to try and see them, so we asked Miu to borrow a microscope from her lab. Long story short… it wasn’t insect-bugs he was seeing, but, rather, this whole place is bugged. There are tiny cameras just… recording us all the time, everywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pales, bringing her hands to her chest. “Is that… is that really true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Couldn’t make up such a weird story if I wanted,” Ryoma replies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And none of us can see these things,” Kaito says. “So it doesn’t matter where the hell we go—Monokuma’s always watching.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Maki says with a sigh. “While I suppose it’s vaguely interesting to know the method, we already knew we were being monitored. Monokuma always knows the tricks to every case and who the culprit is, so there was already no question that we were under constant surveillance everywhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “That’s why I never thought it was necessary to share, and it’s not like we can suddenly stop it now that we know what it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs on the brim of her hat. “I… think that might be true, but I have a question, Ryoma. You said these were cameras, so does that mean there’s some place where all this footage is going to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Has to be,” he says. “But hell if I know where it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Maybe the mastermind has a secret lair somewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede again narrows her eyes, staring at him searchingly. Tenko says softly, “We already know that, too, that’s where,” her hands clench into fists and her eyes remain fixed on the pristine tabletop of the long dining room table. “That’s where Himiko was killed when she tried to fight back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito starts to say, “Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins on her heel, hair whipping behind her. “Tenko needs some air,” she says quickly. “J-Just shout if you need her, and…” she trails off and doesn’t bother to finish her final thought before leaving the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares after her worriedly, only turning back around when she hears Kokichi say, “She’s right,” a few moments after the doors swing shut. “Himiko tried to do something and she got killed for her troubles. The mastermind is just so rude, aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glares at him. “You’re talking as if you had nothing to do with that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He folds his hands behind his head nonchalantly. “I just gave her the supplies and plan, Harumaki-chan. But I was never at the scene of the crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you know what ‘the scene of the crime’ is,” she says. “You and Kaede both do and you’ve been hiding it from us for some godforsaken rea—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says. “You said ‘supplies.’ Is that… shit that can cause a blackout like the one Himiko made? Do you have more crap like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Ooh, maybe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He does,” Kaede says. “Miu made these… EMP grenades, and Himiko used one of them earlier, but there should still be two more. And there were also these hammer things that I think could do the same thing, though I don’t know how many of those she ended up making.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze, give away all my secrets,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Okay—okay. So we got the shit Miu made, which can take out machines and her remote to control the Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When you say it like that,” Ryoma says. “Almost starting to sound like there’s a chance we might be able to do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we can use that stuff to try and defeat Monokuma,” Tsumugi says. “But… where would we go after that? There’s still no place for us to go… and even if we get rid of Monokuma,” she hugs herself. “The mastermind is still going to be hiding among us, and that’s just assuming they don’t try to do anything to sabotage us. And if we fail to do this by the time limit…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A lot of shit can go wrong,” Kaito says. “Yeah, but it’s still our only option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs as she finally stands. “Maybe we do have weapons or know where the mastermind’s hideout is, but Tsumugi’s right. We’re also facing an enemy where we have no idea what their capabilities are—not to mention that Monokuma could just kill us all whenever he wants if he decides we’re breaking the rules.” She shoots a glare to Kaito. “And you’re still injured—if you try to get into a fight, you’ll die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” he says. “Stop worrying about me, and just,” he shakes his head before a smile somehow finds its way on to his face. “Believe in me maybe? I believe in you and everyone else here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The mastermi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaito says. “I know they’re probably right in front of my fucking face and laughing to themselves, but I don’t give a shit. Because I believe in you guys, and right now the only thing we can do is just believe in each other and not let Monokuma trick us anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki furrows her brow. “‘Trick us?’” she echoes. “Why do you say that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves a hand vaguely. “Every motive has been a fucking trick to try and get someone to do crap. That’s just what Monokuma does—he gets in your head and tries to trick you into doing something you think is right when it really just fucks everything up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps staring at him intently, while Kokichi says, “How astute of you, Kaito,” before laughing. “Maybe all that beauty sleep is actually making you smarter instead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Was that supposed to be a fucking compliment?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” Kokichi says, hoping to his feet. “Would I ever insult my beloved Kaito?” He skips over to him. “But I have to say that as much as I believe in my dearest Kaito, I just think that right now I trust no one and nothing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito balks. “The hell does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means we’ve been talking about how the mastermind will totally stab us in the back the first chance they get, buuuut they’re not the only one who might betray us.” He shoots a beaming smile to Kaede. “After all, sometimes motives make people do crazy things, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already told you,” Kaito says. “I’m not about to let that happen. I decided that I’m gonna protect you, and nothing’s gonna fucking make me go back on that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aww, my hero,” Kokichi says. “Buuut I think I’m gonna take matters into my own hands, so don’t you worry your pretty little head about me, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Wha—you’re not even going to try to work with everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is anyone surprised?” Maki asks coldly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi clicks his tongue. “Haven’t I already told you? Cooperation in this game is impossible, and trying to work together will only make us suffer. And since I love you all so much, I want to prevent that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says nervously. “What are you going to do then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Beats me!” he says. “I like to make up plans as I go along—that’s just my style. Or maybe that was a lie. Guess we’ll see!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just sighs. “Alright, fine, run around and do your own thing—I don’t fucking care—but we’re fighting so,” he holds out his hand towards Kokichi. “At least give us the fucking remote for the Exisals so we stand a damn chance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki suddenly jerks her head to him. “Kokichi still has the remote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Yeah, but don’t worry about it, Harumaki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi juts out his lower lip. “But it’s mine, and I’ve already named the Exisals, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says sharply. “This isn’t a joke, and we also quite literally do not have time for your games right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who said it was a joke?” Kokichi says, titling his head. “In my opinion, jokes have to be funny.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs again. “Kokichi, I’m fucking asking nicely here, either promise you’ll work with us or give me the remote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his hat. “Sure that’ll go well…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are we even bothering with asking?” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because we believe in each other, and we’re gonna fucking work together or die trying,” Kaito says, near exasperated. “That’s why, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki frowns. “Why are you so intent on this? Why can’t you just…” Kaede sees her hands twitching at her sides as if trying to grasp her own frustration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki…” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” Kokichi cheers suddenly. “How about this? You guys do Kaito’s totally a great idea and not a murder-suicide pact plan, and I’ll do my own plan to protect everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that plan is?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “Secret.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re not gonna give us the remote?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “I’ll think about giving the remote to someone tomorrow based on how things go. How about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tsumugi says. “What ‘things?’ What are you going to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me?” Kokichi says. “Oh you know, I just think I’m gonna go end the killing game. But anyway! I’ll see you guys tomorrow… if no one’s betrayed you by then, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that he moves to push the doors open, only exclaiming, “Hi, Tenko!” as he nearly runs straight into Tenko on the other side before dashing around her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks quickly between him and the tensely silent room. “What was…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing,” Kaito says. “This just,” he runs a hand through is hair. “This is just gonna be a lot fucking harder than it needs to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says warily. “But, if everyone is done with the meeting, Tenko would like to escort Kaede and Ryoma back to their rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Escort?” Maki says dubiously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma slowly clamors with his crutches to his feet. “Yeah,” he says. “Might trip and fall and break my other leg.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends a glance to Kaito. “Are we… done talking about this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs. “Guess we fucking are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” she says. “I guess we’ll all… try and prepare today and meet again tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods weakly, and Kaede wonders if he’s been forcing the bravado and cheer in his words as much as she has. She gives him a sympathetic smile before following Ryoma still moving slowly on his crutches out the door. Just before the doors swing closed, she sees Maki stepping closer to Kaito and hears the beginnings of what she assumes is going to be a hushed argument. Tsumugi simply sits in her chair, fidgeting awkwardly as she seems to accept her place as being treated like furniture.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the hall, Tenko lets out a sigh of relief. “Sorry, Tenko left you alone. She just…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry about it,” Ryoma says. “Obviously we both lived.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth pulls into a tight line. “Don’t say that, especially considering…” she looks to Kaede. “What did Kaito say we were going to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s insisting we try and fight,” Kaede answers. “But I think almost everyone has their own ideas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So much for working together and believing in each other,” Ryoma says. “Doesn’t help that we’re in that—what was that thing Rantaro mentioned—prisoner’s dilemma. Working together seems great, yeah, but at the end of the day, it's in everyone's best interest to just betray each other…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “Ryoma, Kaede, just… stay with Tenko, okay? She’ll protect you if anything happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure,” Ryoma says with a shrug before beginning his slow walk down the hall. “Not like I can get far on my own anyhow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns as she begins to follow him, Kaede at her side. “Tenko,” Kaede says. “Are you… do you really think just letting the time limit expire is the best idea?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “But… Tenko doesn’t want anyone to die or try to sacrifice themselves, or,” she shakes her head. “Tenko just… doesn’t want to live on the backs of her friends’ deaths.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t think of anyway to respond to that other than to just nod. “Right,” she says. “Um, right…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only when they’re back at the entrance of the school that Kaede dares speak again. “Hey, Tenko,” she says suddenly, startling both her and Ryoma. “There’s something I need to go do, but I promise I’ll see you later, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko freezes. “You’re… just going off on your own? Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know, I know,” she says. “It sounds like an awful idea given what’s going on, but there’s something I need to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s jaw tightens, and she spares a glance towards Ryoma standing a few feet away from them, absently chewing on one of his cigarettes and giving them the courtesy of pretending not to be aware of their conversation. She takes a step closer to Kaede and lowers her voice. “Kaede,” she says. “Tenko doesn’t want to make you panic or worry you, but… you need to be really careful, okay? Um,” she briefly looks around to double check that they are alone. “Maki is really desperate to try and end the killing game. Tenko knows that Kaito made her promise not to do anything, but, with the time limit…” she shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a slight rush of dread but simply nods at her information. “I… I see. So you think Maki might…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks she’s willing to do a lot if she thinks it will protect Kaito,” Tenko says. “She doesn’t think Maki will let him fight or do anything that might put him in danger and… if the time limit gets close to its end…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes in a shaky breath. “You think she might try and sabotage things to keep him safe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know about that, but, just,” she reaches forward to squeeze Kaede’s good hand. “Tenko is asking you to please let her protect you, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” she says. “I promise I will be right back. I just need to find Kokichi and ask him something really important. That’s it, I swear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko furrows her brow, and glances at Ryoma over her shoulder again. “Can Tenko come with you? She can take Ryoma back to the dorms and tell him not to open the door for anyone until we get back, and then we can go together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches up to fiddle with her hat and likely takes too long to finally say, “I… think that will be okay. Sure, let’s,” she tries to smile. “Let’s do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, and, mercifully, Ryoma chooses not to ask any question other than sending Kaede a skeptical look as she remains silent while Tenko explains their sudden trip around the school.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma waves them off once he gets settled back in his own room, telling them not to worry, and the two girls set out on their search around the school. Kaede realizes absently as they begin that she really has no idea where Kokichi likes to hang out or where he goes to plan his schemes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">During their trip, Tenko takes out Kiibo to try and explain their situation. They’re in the middle of searching the gardens when Kaede hears his voice echo out, “Suffice to say this does seem close to a worst case scenario. I… will think about how to proceed given my own abilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko advises him to not overwork himself, and Kaede hears little else of their conversation other than repetition of the conversation in the cafeteria intermixed with Kiibo’s own input about the lack of logic in various strategies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how long they spend searching when Tenko tentatively reminds her that they should likely make sure to check up on Ryoma. Kaede can do little but nod in agreement even as almost every muscle in her body just wants to tear her hair out in frustration.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can we just look one more place before we take a break?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko agrees, but Kaede can feel her increasingly worried stares on her back as she slowly leads them down into the library. She stares at where she knows the hidden door is, and startles Tenko when she says aloud, “Shuichi said the mastermind would be here when the time limit ended the first time. Our plan was to just… catch them on film, I guess, and prove to everyone who it was. I… I didn’t think just knowing who they were would do much to stop them, so I took matters into my own hands.” She looks over her shoulder at Tenko and forces a self-deprecating smile. “And here we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You just wanted to save us,” Tenko says. “Maybe things did not work out, but your intentions—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “My intentions were to kill, and… as soon as I was ready to do that, I had basically already lost to Monokuma.” She glances to the spot where Rantaro’s body had been so long ago. “And someone else paid for it. I—Tenko,” she looks back to the other girl. “Is killing the mastermind really going to end this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she says softly. “But… she also doesn’t want to kill them. She just,” she shakes her head. “She just wants this to be over without anyone else dying for us or trying to be a hero or… whatever else will get them killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that why you suggested just letting the time limit expire?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko knows that everyone probably doesn’t agree, but after what’s happened to everyone who tried to escape or fight back—maybe it would just be better if we all died together instead of just accepting that people we love are going to slowly be killed in front of us. And Tenko is,” she presses the heels of her palms to her eyes. “Tenko is so tired of watching her friends get hurt and hurt each other… I’m so tired—so just… Kaede, Tenko knows how you feel about this, but please don’t do anything reckless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment. Then, “Hey, earlier you said you thought that Maki would probably do something to stop Kaito from fighting if she thought it would keep him safe. Would you do the same for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “Tenko… doesn’t know. But she probably would.” She looks to the ground. “Sorry, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says, trying to put a smile back on her face. “I get it—you just really care about me. And,” she reaches to squeeze Tenko’s arm. “I appreciate that. I really do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles back, and Kaede only spares the door to the mastermind’s lair one last look before eventually relenting and letting them leave.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even after a break, the second search for Kokichi is perhaps even more lackluster, and Kaede feels something close to panic when she realizes the sky of the dome is beginning to darken to signal night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only when Tenko tugs lightly on Kaede’s sleeve and gently calls her name does Kaede agree that their search attempt has been a complete failure and needs to come to an end.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the dorms, Kaede goes with Tenko briefly to her room to change the dressings on her arm and pretends she doesn’t notice the deep concern on Tenko’s face as she inspects her injury. The new bandages feel stiff and uncomfortable, but Kaede doesn’t complain, instead opting to say, “I think I’ll be okay to sleep in my own room tonight,” as they walk back into the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns but nods. “Are you sure? Tenko is fine sleeping on the couch to make sure—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You need your rest, too,” Kaede says. “And I promise I’ll be okay. You don’t have to look after me all the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know things are,” she lowers her voice, “probably really dangerous right now, but it’s only going to be one night, okay? I just won’t open my door for anyone until morning,” Kaede says. “I promise that. And you better not either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko won’t,” she says, finally stepping away from her and back towards her own door. “Just… please be safe, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will,” Kaede says. “Goodnight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Being back in her room for the first time in so long almost feels good, and Kaede immediately hates how relieving the familiarity of it is. She sits on her bed for a moment before preparing to sleep, absently thinking about just how long she’s been imprisoned in the school and how that imprisonment might very well come to an abrupt end in what is now roughly two days time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma wishes her goodnight from the monitor, and Kaede stares at her ceiling until sleep finally takes her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When she wakes up the next morning, it feels as if she had closed her eyes for perhaps a minute at most. Her arm aches painfully, though about a fraction less than the day before, and Kaede’s first movement is to grab for the painkillers in her bag and swallow an amount she knows Tenko would disapprove of.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the time limit hanging over her head, everyone movement feels slower as if she can physically see the seconds her every action is consuming. But, still, Kaede slings her backpack over her shoulders and places her worn out hat on her head before making her way to her door to embrace whatever new horror is likely waiting on the other side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">However, as she takes the last step towards her door, Kaede hears a slight crunch of paper under her foot. Her head immediately snaps down to see what appears to be a folded piece of paper laying on the ground as if it were slipped under her door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t waste a seconds as she hurries to pick it up, unfolding the now slightly crumpled paper to see rather messy, childish looking handwriting that reads:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Meet me in the machinery bay at noon. Come alone.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>P.S. Bring lots of food!!!</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She furrows her brow, reading the fairly simple message over again, unsure what to possibly make of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jumps when her doorbell rings, and she hears Tenko’s voice call from the other side, “Kaede? Are you there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yes!” she answers hurriedly, and, in a split second decision, she shoves the letter in her backpack before opening the door with her most plastered on smile yet. “Sorry I was just… trying to collect myself a little, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles sympathetically. “Of course. Um, Tenko thinks Ryoma would probably appreciate if you could stop by his room to give him some medicine, but then… Tenko doesn’t really know what we’ll do today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods as she steps past the other girl and out into the hall. “I’m sure we’ll figure something out,” she says. “You know—I think Kaito was right. All we need to do is work together and believe in each other, and,” she thinks she can almost feel the letter burning in her bag. “And something will come up. I just… I just know it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sorry for the very long wait on this one, but hopefully I should be back to a regular updating schedule! Also chapter 5s tend to be motiveless, so I thought this would be a good time to get to play around with the one canon motive I wasn't able to, haha, and hopefully I justified it enough in story, though of course, you are the judge of that!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And also another quick note looking forward is that if everything goes right, my goal is going to be to finish this fic on April 1st since that's the day I published the first chapter. So hopefully I make that date!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko does most of the talking when they greet Ryoma at his door as Kaede’s mind races over the letter. The morning announcement plays, signaling that she has four hours to make a decision, and she can feel it ticking away as Tenko again insists on the three of them walking to the school as a group.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi greets them on their way and chatters inanely, providing Kaede some much appreciated cover to allow herself to silently mull over the letter. It’s not too hard to guess who wrote it—the three people around her show no signs of anything seeming different with them other than perhaps being a touch more on edge due to the time limit. She’s also doubtful that Kaito would choose to send a secret message over just coming to her in person, and she’s even more doubtful that Maki would be its sender almost on principle alone. The idea that Maki’s handwriting is childish enough to match the letter is an amusing one, but Kaede doesn’t dwell on it long.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But, ultimately, Kaede realizes that knowing who sent it does little to answer any of her questions about how to proceed. She had spent almost all of the previous day looking for Kokichi, and now here he was openly offering a meeting, and—though perhaps it was a bit of blind faith of the weirdest kind—she was fairly certain he had no intentions of killing her outright. It could still very well be a trap, and the last part of the message seemed to indicate to her that Kokichi intended for someone to be stuck somewhere away from the cafeteria for a rather long time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">However, Kaede’s biggest question still is not whether to go, but if sneaking off on her own would even be possible. Their walk to the school has the façade of calm, but Kaede doesn’t miss any of the alertness in Tenko’s movements even as she makes idle conversation with Tsumugi.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s still in silent debate with herself when they reach the cafeteria, and Tenko again takes a moment outside its doors to center herself and ball her hands into tightly clenched fists. Kaede follows inside after her, and ends up stopping in her tracks almost right outside the door at the sight before her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Six of the strange hammer things that Miu had showed her so long ago are laid out on the table, and Kokichi stands to the side of them one arm held out to seemingly present them with a flourish.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone’s finally here!” he says. “Geeze, took you slowpokes long enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The hell are these?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito picks one up to inspect the sleek handle. “Kokichi said they were called, uh, Electrohammers?” he says, turning to Kokichi for confirmation. “Apparently Miu made them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede already knows,” Maki says. “She mentioned them yesterday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though she says it calmly, Kaede can’t help but feel herself tense at Maki’s words. “I did,” she says tightly. “And Kokichi has—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Decided to give you all a present,” Kokichi finishes. “I still have my own plans, but I figured it’d be boring if you guys just sat around did nothing all day, you know? So I wanted to help you out a little.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, um,” Tsumugi says. “Is that true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Who gives a shit if it’s true? Kokichi—how do these things work?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips over to him and begins to explain the basics—hit something with it to deactivate any electronics, it runs out of battery quickly and needs twenty-four hours to recharge. From her firmly rooted spot at the door, Tenko says, “Are there only six of them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Kokichi tilts his head. “Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scowls but continues. “Miu made these, but when she was alive… there were nine of us. So… why would she only make six of them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns to him. “Kokichi,” he says. “Tenko right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums for a moment before crossing his arms behind his head. “Aw, you got me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sound really torn up about it,” Ryoma says, rolling his eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sighs dramatically. “Well, I knew there was no way I could get away with lying to you guys,” he says. “Yeah, you figured me out—there might be a few extras lying around somewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes. “You say that like you don’t know exactly where they are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi gasps. “Maki, are you accusing me of lying? After I helped you guys out of the goodness of my heart?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, um,” Tsumugi says. “I guess Kokichi’s planning something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that plan involves hoarding electrohammers somewhere?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi blinks up at her. “Yes,” he says. “Somewhere.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any of Kaede’s lingering doubts that Kokichi sent the letter evaporate, and Kaito starts to speak over their silent conversation. “Okay, so maybe there are extras, but who gives a shit? We’ve got six of these here, and there’re six of us.” He readies the hammer in his hand as if going to battle. “I say we take these and fucking bust open the door to the mastermind’s lair right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then what?” Maki asks. “We fight them with our weapons that only work on machines?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Maybe we could crack open the lock on your lab or something and grab some shit from there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We could,” Ryoma says. “But if we hand out weapons, aren’t we just arming the mastermind, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then we’d just have to fight them and whatever weapons Monokuma has,” Tsumugi says. “Ugh, and Monokuma’s plainly going to be really angry at us for breaking the rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Guys, we’ve fucking been over this. Yeah, a lot of shit might go wrong, but we don’t have any other choices besides fighting back. I know you’re probably all freaked out, and I get that so,” he smiles brightly at the others. “I’ll take responsibility for whatever happens. Promise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “What does that mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means if shit does go wrong, then it’s on me,” he answers. “I’ll take the blame for whatever if we fail, and if we don’t get our shit together by the time limit then,” he takes a moment and to Kaede’s horror, he still manages to say his next words as upbeat and positively as the rest of his speech. “Then I’ll kill myself, and you guys can carry on my will and get the hell out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’ll what?” Tenko says very softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede starts to turn to her, when Maki snaps, “Have you—you,” Kaede looks back to see the other girl practically shaking with rage. “Have you lost your <i>fucking</i> mind!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems taken aback. “Harumaki? What’s the matte—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You just said you’re going to commit suicide—what the hell do you think is the matter?” she says, voice now deadly quiet. “After everything—why are you so willing to just sacrifice yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” he says, voice serious. “You’re acting like this is something I want to do, and it’s not—it’s just…” he runs a hand through his hair. “Maybe… I don’t have quite as much time left as I’ve been saying, alright? And like I said before, if I’m gonna die, I’m gonna do it fighting against Monokuma and protecting you guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you think we want to be protected like that?” Maki says. “You think we’re just supposed to accept this and just—just swallow the fact that you’ll kill yourself and move on like nothing happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “I’m not expecting you to… I’m just, hey, Harumaki, weren’t you saying that we need to be fucking realistic or something? So yeah, it fucking sucks, but yesterday when I was trying to get you guys to do anything about the time limit crap, no one wanted to do shit other than point out holes in my plan, so I thought of a backup one. And that’s all it is, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki narrows her eyes. “All of your plans result in your death. You do realize that, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The hell are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our options are to fight Monokuma and the mastermind and whatever stockpile of unknown weapons they have with a plan they’re going to be prepared for—the people who are weak or injured likely won’t make it out alive,” Maki begins. “Or we just let the time limit expire and all die doing nothing… or you decide to sacrifice yourself. No matter what we do, you’re going to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito goes silent for a moment as he places the electrohammer back on the table with a soft click of the metal against the table’s surface. It’s a small noise, but it echoes in the dead quiet of the room. He takes an uncomfortably long moment to form an answer to Maki’s accusation, running a hand through his hair while her hands tighten into fists. “Yeah,” he says finally. “Yeah, I probably am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi says very quietly, “That’s all you have to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glances back at him and seems to realize everyone else in the room other than him and Maki at once. “I’m,” his bravado collapses all at once with a defeated shrug of his shoulders. “I’m sorry, guys. I don’t know what the hell else you want from me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want you to stop letting yourself be tricked by Monokuma,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t seem angry as much as just confused when he asks, “How am I being tricked?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki lets her glare falter to the ground, then. “You said that when Monokuma convinces you to kill, you’ve lost, but isn’t choosing to let yourself die in a killing game… isn’t that what he wants, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Harumaki,” he says. “You know that’s not why I’d do anything—I already fucking learned my lesson. So it’d be,” he shakes his head. “On my own terms—I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki looks back up at him, her cold face twisted with an emotion other than anger for perhaps the first time Kaede has ever seen. “Fine then,” she says. “If you won’t think of another way to end this killing game, then I will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito calls after her again as she storms out of the room with a fierce determination in her movements. Kaito runs a hand over his face. “Fuck,” he says. “Uh, Tenko—can you take care of the electrohammers? Just put them somewhere safe or some shit? I gotta…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko understands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods back at her, and exits the room at a slight jog even as Kaede notices him wince as he begins his first steps at a brisk pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With him gone, Tenko clears her throat. “Tenko will… take these to her room to guard,” she announces, taking a few obviously pained steps towards the table. “Um, she might also need someone to help her carry them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly perks up at her words. “Ah, well, Tsumugi would make the most sense, right? I mean, Ryoma and I… we’re not in the greatest shape to carry things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’m unreliable,” Kokichi adds brightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that really something to be happy about?” Tsumugi says. “But, well, I suppose I could help if you want Tenko. I’ll admit I… don’t really have any other plans.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guarding in groups of at least three would make the most sense, too,” Ryoma adds. “Just in case we end up including someone… not on our side in that group.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko grimaces as looks over the electrohammers laid out on the table. “Tenko, Ryoma, and Kaede will guard them then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaede says. “Actually, Tsumugi, you just volunteered to help carry them down to Tenko’s room, right? Wouldn’t it make the most sense for you to be on guard duty?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi furrows her brow. “Well, I guess? I mean, I wouldn’t mind doing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” Tenko says. “Is something—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just,” she spares a glance to Kokichi who unhelpfully beams back at her. “I spent all of yesterday looking for Kokichi, so I’d kind of like to talk to him before he runs away again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am prone to doing that,” he says conversationally.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs, fiddling with the brim of her hat. “So we’ll just talk for a minute, and then I’ll meet you guys back at the dorms, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You need to have a conversation alone?” Ryoma asks, not bothering to hide his suspicions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t worry,” Kokichi says. “If Kaede tries to kill me, I’m prepared to fight back and scream for help!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes before looking back to Tenko staring worriedly at her. “I promise it will be really fast—there’s just something I want to double check with him about the Exisals. And if we take too long, you can come down to the machinery bay to tell us to hurry up, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Kaede… you really want to go off on your own right now, don’t you? Even with…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She won’t be alone,” Kokichi says. “Because Kaede and I are the best of friends now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Not to stir things up, but,” she glances between the two of them. “Don’t you two plainly hate each other?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi waves his hand. “Pish-posh, Tsumugi, you’re such a slowpoke. I got bored of hating Kaede a long time ago, and Kaede loves and trusts everyone including moi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “Kokichi, you’re not helping.” She sighs and walks over to Tenko. “I promise I’ll be okay.” She looks back at the others before lowering her voice. “Kokichi’s probably scared of Maki, too. I think that’s why he was hiding yesterday. Even if he’s not the most trustworthy person, we’re on the same side here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glances behind Kaede briefly, biting her lip. “Kaede,” her eyes move to the surface of the table, and Kaede knows exactly what she’s thinking. “Just… no matter what, please don’t do anything risky, okay? Even if you think it’ll save us or stop the killing game, please think of your safety first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I will,” she says before moving to pull Tenko into a quick hug. “And thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko returns her hug, careful not to squeeze the shoulder of her injured arm before pulling away. Kaede smiles at her encouragingly, repeating, “I promise I’ll be okay,” as she tries her best to pretend she doesn’t see the obvious pain in Tenko’s eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ready to go on our super secret adventure now, Kaede?” Kokichi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede winces at his choice of words. “Yeah,” she says. “Let’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” Kokichi says suddenly, hurrying into the kitchen. “Help me carry food!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede ignores the looks of obvious confusion on the others’ faces as she hurries after him with an apologetic smile directed to the others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside the kitchen, she idly moves without instruction to pull food from various shelves, though still baffled as to why. After a few moments, she hears the tell tale sounds of foot steps and Ryoma’s crutches beginning to move and, eventually, the door swinging shut behind them.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waits a few more moments to hear their steps carry down the hall before turning to Kokichi. “Kokichi, the others left, so we can just talk here, can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” he answers, pulling away from the counter, balancing as much food as his skinny arms can carry. “To the machinery bay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He moves past her, only calling out, “C’mon, we gotta get this show on the road, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His choice of words does little to ease her worries, but Kaede still follows after him, carrying a few items of her own. “Can’t we talk on the way at least, then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums, and his only response is to glance at her and scoff. “That’s all you’re bringing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t even know what all this is for,” Kaede says. “Are you what, just camping out in the machinery bay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Something like that,” he answers vaguely.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs again, though becomes pointedly aware from Kokichi’s need to walk a few paces ahead of her that he isn’t going to be answering any more questions until they reach their destination.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She feels a bit guilty as they pass by the dorms but keeps her pace behind Kokichi on their trek across the school. When they finally reach the machinery bay, Kokichi keeps walking without slowing down or offering a word of explanation as he moves through the twisting halls to the Exisal hanger at the far end. Kaede follows quietly, and while she is still fairly certain Kokichi won’t do anything, she can’t help but feel a touch tense at being alone with someone else in a remote part of the school faraway from everyone else.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The gate to the hanger stands closed with its barrier back up and shining blandly at them. Kokichi shifts the stuff in his hands in an attempt to reach for something in his pocket while he juts his chin at the gate. “Kaede, you’re carrying less stuff—open it…” he shifts a bit more, finally producing a familiar looking remote. “Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He presses a button, and with it, the barrier falls. Kaede frowns as she approaches the gate. “How much stuff do you have?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’ll see,” he answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes again as she pulls the gate up easily enough with her good hand and it moves up towards the ceiling. She immediately jerks back to see the entrance completely blocked by the two working Exisals. “Kokichi, what are—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One second,” he says, and Kaede hears him shuffling his items around again. “Just gotta grab… remote number two…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits for a few tense seconds before Kokichi fishes it out of his pocket and awkwardly navigates the Exisals away from the door with one hand. He moves past her as if nothing had just occured and walks inside the hanger to deposit his pile of what Kaede now notices is assorted junk food on the ground. “C’mon, Kaede,” he says. “You’re such a slowpoke.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses, briefly wondering just what she’s getting herself into as she steps inside the hanger. Those wonderings turn to a quick jolt of fear when she notices Kokichi moving back to the control panel to lower the gate and turn the barrier back on. “Kokichi,” she says. “What are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Closing us off,” he says. “In a mastermind, Monokuma, and Maki free zone. Unless Maki is the mastermind, then it’s just a Monokuma and mastermind free zone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she looks around at the piles of stuff on the floor. Other than food, she notices what appears to be a sleeping bag, a few notebooks with pages coming out of them, and the missing electrohammers and EMP grenades clumped together inelegantly. “You… have been camping out down here,” she observes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope, not yet,” Kokichi says, skipping back towards her. “Planning to tonight, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is your room not safe?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “My room is fine—it’s just the rest of the school that’s dangerous. There’re murders out there, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms and lets herself simply study him for a moment as Kokichi opts to simply sit on the ground and start flipping through a notebook. “Alright,” she says. “Enough games—why did you call me here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “I already told you—mastermind and murderer free,” he smiles up at her. “Unless you stab me in the back that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That didn’t answer my question,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It answers the point of your question,” Kokichi says. “But really the truth is that I actually just wanted to meet secretly so I could kill you and escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede merely raises her eyebrows. “An answer that isn’t a lie, please.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Well, since you said please, I guess I can let you in on a few things.” He sets his notebook aside and pats the ground in front of him. “Take a seat, Kaede. It’s a long story, and I really like the melodious sound of my own voice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns but sits, awkwardly folding her legs under her on the cold metal ground. “If you try to lie, I’m leaving,” she warns.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but Kaede, lying is my way of life,” he says. “Buuut I guess I’ll only stick to nice lies to make you happy. Which reminds me, I just wanted to tell you how strong you’ve seemed lately—I bet you could fight off a bull with one hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t miss the way he nods to the bandage still wrapped around her arm. “I’m hurt,” she says. “I know. Now can we move on to something less obvious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure!” Kokichi says happily. “Let’s see, let’s see, where to start… Oh! I know—so I’ve been thinking about the motive, and I’ve decided it’s a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede physically feels her jaw drop open. “It’s—it’s—what?” she sputters. “You—you just decided what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How to explain,” he muses aloud. “How to explain to someone very, very slow…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kokichi says. “Think back to Shuichi’s trial—you remember that right? He took the fall for you, tricked everyone into thinking you didn’t murder Rantaro, blahblah blah—anyway, right before Shuichi was about to be executed, do you remember what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls. “Do you really expect me to answer that?” Kokichi simply grins at her and she lets out a labored sigh. “Fine. I… failed to protect him and he said it was better to just let him be punished. That it was,” she grimaces as she repeats the word he said so long ago, “the best possible outcome.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Close enough to the right answer, so partial credit. But a better answer is that Kaito, Tenko, and Gonta also offered to help you fight against Monokuma to protect him, right? And that’s when I realized why Monokuma was okay with letting Shuichi take the fall.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He rolls his eyes. “Monokuma threatened a five way execution, but it was a bluff. Sure, he’d probably punish one person if they tried to do something, but there was no way he’d just let five participants die so early. ‘Cause then we’d be down to ten and that means he’d miss out on two super exciting trials.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So… Monokuma wants alive,” Kaede says slowly. “I mean, I realized that if he just wanted us dead, he could have killed us with the Exisals at the very beginning, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that would have been boring,” Kokichi says. “He let us get away with voting wrong because if we all die at the first trial, his game ends when it had just barely begun. Monokuma is strict about his rules, but if it means keeping the game interesting, he’ll bend them. The game being exciting always comes first, and a game where everyone dies immediately is the opposite of exciting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says, something from that day suddenly standing out to her very vividly. “After the trial, Monokuma came to my room and he said, uh,” she frowns, trying to call his words, “he said, ‘it’s a pain when the first killer gets away with it’ or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems genuinely interested as he says, “Well, that about confirms all my theories. Shame he told that to you instead of me, but I guess I wasn’t threatening to upend the whole game back then. My mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Anyway,” Kaede stammers, now very invested in their conversation. “You said that Monokuma let us vote wrong because everyone dying at the beginning would be boring. Would… everyone just dying at the end also be boring?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “A plus plus, Kaede. Of course, I have to give credit where credit is due. You helped me realize that—what was it—‘everyone forced into the killing game.’ Quite the phrase, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly feels the excitement she had felt flood out of her. “Yeah. Shuichi pointed that out to me… which is why we tried to trap the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then credit to Shuichi,” he says. “My mistake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Anyway… what was your point? Shuichi pointed that out because it implies—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That one of us wasn’t forced into the killing game,” Kokichi says. “I know. But I also know that there’s no way Monokuma’s about to let his super exciting killing game actually end with us all just sitting in the dining hall until we die from a time limit. Sooo,” he hums leaning back slightly. “I put two and two together and came up with something horrible. And I’ll tell you if you pinky promise to keep it secret—one non-mastermind to another.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces. “What is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means consider this,” Kokichi says brightly. “Monokuma is safe with bluffing because he left himself a loophole to get out of actually killing us and ending the game on a boring note. Ta da! Mystery solved.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The loophole is that… those forced into the game die,” Kaede says, thinking hard. “And you’re saying Monokuma wouldn’t have to kill any of us with that loophole? Wha—what?” She shakes her head. “Are you saying we <i>weren’t</i> forced into the killing game!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sheesh, calm down, Kaede,” he says. “We won’t get anywhere if you get all emotional on me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You just implied that we all volunteered to kill each other in some sick game!” Kaede says. “Why—why the hell would you lie about something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The smile suddenly drops off his face. “I guess it is more appealing to think it’s a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not about what’s ‘appealing,’” Kaede says. “It’s about—there is just absolutely no way anyone would volunteer for a killing game! And,” she throws her hands in the air, the gesture only sending a brief spike of pain up her arm. “I don’t remember agreeing to being trapped here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi regards her for a moment. Then, “what if we haven’t remembered that yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We both know Monokuma can play with our memories whenever he likes,” Kokichi says. “So maybe we forgot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, just—how can you say something like that so calmly?” Kaede asks, fighting against her own anger to keep the volume of her voice down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Why does the truth make you so mad? I gave you a solution based on facts, but it’s not happy, so you throw a fit and tell me I must be lying.” He hums to himself. “Sounds like you might have a fear of the truth, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She clenches her jaw. “Why are you so eager to accept something so horrible? Are you that proud that you managed to figure something out that you don’t even care what it is? And,” she points an accusatory finger at him. “After Angie’s trial, you told me you didn’t want my help, so why the hell am I even here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pauses again before physically turning away from her to rummage through his stuff. Kaede’s about to snap at him for ignoring her when he says, “If I didn’t need your help, I never would have called you here—so don’t flatter yourself. But, well, see, I said all of that before I had to dodge four attempts on my life and realized I had to put a few walls of steel between myself and attempt number five.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says, tugging on her hat as she analyzes the situation before her. “You’re scared of dying now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says nonchalantly. “I’ve accepted the fact that I might have to use my life to end the killing game for a while now. What I don’t want is to die as a boring loser who accomplished nothing. And,” he pulls a different notebook from his pile and turns back to her. “You have some information I want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, crossing her arms. “And there’s something I need to ask you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins again. “Tradesies?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pinches the bridge of her nose. “As long as we’re not calling it that, sure. Anyway,” she straightens her hat. “I have a real plan to end the killing game, but I need your help or at least the remote for the Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No can do,” he says, casually flipping through the pages on his notebook. “Exisals are defense number one against Harumaki-chans. So anyway—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just listen for five seconds,” Kaede says. “Kaito was talking earlier about just charging the mastermind’s hideout, and… I know that didn’t work out when Himiko did it, even though she had one of those,” she gestures vaguely at the remaining two next to him, “thingies. But, I think we both know she threw it at the central hub of the school—it’s like this weird Monokuma head thing—and if we use the Exisals to just destroy it altogether,” she lets out a deep breath. “We might actually be able to end the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s eyes flicker over her before he says, “Describe the Monokuma head thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says, trying to conjure the incredibly strange though now distant memory. “It called itself… the Motherkuma or something? And apparently it makes new Monokumas when the mastermind tells it to,” she winces in embarrassment, “to b-birth a new Monokuma. But anyway, you can reach it through the passage in the girl’s bathroom, and I think it might also be the center of the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He continues scribbling on his notepad, and without looking up, he asks, “How do you know that? The part about the system it uses to make new Monokumas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a similar weight to when they were discussing Shuichi fall over her. “I… found it by chance with Miu, and she… she figured it out. The entire thing was weird though. Like,” she furrows her brow. “It wasn’t angry that we were in the mastermind’s lair as much as it was… annoyed we were there early?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks up at her over the top of his notepad. “Did it say that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It said something like,” she tugs at her hat, trying to recall the memory. “We weren’t supposed to be there yet. I thought it was weird at the time, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The Motherkuma,” Kokichi says. “Sounds like an exciting final boss, right? Raiding the mastermind’s lair, finding the source of their power, then fighting the final boss—sounds like an exciting ending for a game, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “You think we’re supposed to go there… later? As some sort of grand finale?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sets down his notebook. “The final survivors, standing together against despair, rallied forward by the tragic deaths of their friends, taking down the big bad in a final epic action sequence—or maybe another trial knowing Monokuma? Sounds like a hell of an ending to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that implies… that we’re supposed to win against Monokuma,” Kaede says incredulously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you assumed we weren’t,” Kokichi says. “Which is a silly thing to assume since, well, you were there at the first trial, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glares at him. “Anyway, now that you know my plan, are you going to help me or not? I’ll tell you whatever it is you want to know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You already did,” Kokichi says. “See, that was the goal of my plan with Himiko to try and figure out what was in the mastermind’s lair and maybe get some pictures, but we both know that was a total failure. But now you told me because I asked nicely, so I guess Himiko’s death really was meaningless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites back her first reaction to snap at him and instead says, “You don’t really believe that. Or if you do, you feel horrible about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So to sum up, I learned what I wanted to know, and I’m not going to help you with your dumb plan that won’t work,” he says brightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scowls. “And destroying the thing that’s the center of the school and makes new Monokumas won’t work because?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because you haven’t been paying attention to a word I said if you really think this game ends with the mastermind and Monokuma,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It,” Kaede blinks at him. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs as he examines his fingernails. “C’mon, I know you got a brain somewhere in there, Kaede. Think about it—the advanced machinery, the ability to change memories at will, the intricate rules and the need to adhere to them. Do you really think this is all the will of one person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… I don’t know, but,” she shakes her head. “If it’s not, then how do we end the killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That,” Kokichi gestures to the notebook, “is what I’ve been trying to figure out since day one, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “No, that can’t be true—this all sounds like some crazed conspiracy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I left all my tinfoil hats back in my room,” Kokichi says. “Real shame.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at him before letting out a sigh. “Okay, fine, but if it is all this huge conspiracy, and my plan won’t work, then what are you planning to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right now,” he says, leaning back on his sleeping bag. “I’m planning to survive. Which means waiting out the time limit in my metal fortress with my robot bodyguards.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you really are going to just hide out here, and,” her eyes fall over the piles of notes practically bursting out of their bindings. She tugs her hat down. “Try to think of a way to end the killing game all by yourself…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it. And you,” he points at Kaede without bothering to sit up, “should go tell Tenko you’re still alive before she comes down here and sets off the shutter’s alarm. Actually, we’ve been talking for a while, and given how long it would take to get Ryoma settled, maybe check on his injuries, find Kaito and tell him where the electrohammers are, I predict Tenko will be here to set off the alarm any second now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just raises her eyebrows. “You can’t possibly have estimated a time for all of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, see, when you say that, Kaede, what you’re failing to take into consideration is the fact that I’m a genius,” he says matter-of-factly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She rolls her eyes, and is about to respond when the alarm begins blaring loudly from outside, and she hears Tenko’s voice yelp in surprise. Kokichi looks far too pleased with himself, and Kaede says over the screeching alarm, “this doesn’t mean anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He keeps grinning as he takes his time to grab the hanger’s remote to silence the siren before cupping one hand around his mouth to yell out, “Tenko! Walk around to the window!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Window?” Kaede repeats, shuffling to her feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In the bathroom,” Kokichi replies jerking his chin towards a door in the back as he stands as well.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He starts to lead the way, and Kaede hurries after him, asking, “You’re coming to talk, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” he answers, pressing a finger to his lips as he pushes the door open with his other hand. “I have to make sure you’re not gonna secretly plot against me, oooor spill all of my super important secrets.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stares after him as he skips over to the room’s sole window and rises onto his tiptoes in order to barely peek out of the window that Kaede can’t help but note is more than a touch too tall for him. She walks a step closer and sees Tenko’s face peeking through on the other side. At her movement, Tenko immediately perks up to shout, “Kaede!” over whatever greeting Kokichi’s giving.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She calls again, “Kaede, are you okay?” as Kaede walks closer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks, saying, “Rude,” as he backs away from the window to give Kaede room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says, peering through the window. “I’m alright—sorry, we ended up having a lot more to talk about than I thought.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re okay?” Tenko asks again despite Kaede’s earlier answer. “No one’s hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says with a shake of her head. “Actually, with the force field over the shutter and the Exisals, this might be the safest place in the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears Kokichi shuffle up to next to her before he says, “And that’s all thanks to who?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Anyway, I’m fine. How’s everything on your end?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says nervously. “Tsumugi and Ryoma are guarding the electrohammers in Tenko’s room, and Tenko talked to Kaito about Maki, and he said, well,” she frowns, “he said he believed in her and they made a promise, so everything will be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, Tenko,” Kokichi coos. “It sounds like you don’t trust Kaito’s judgment, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scowls as she shifts, trying to spy Kokichi out of the corner of the window. “It’s not that—though Tenko supposes an awful boy like you wouldn’t understand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I am the worst,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko just,” she continues. “She just really, really wants everyone to be safe, and she has a really bad feeling about what might happen when the time limit gets closer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment, weighing her words, before she says, “Staying safe is the most important thing right now. Staying safe, so we can get through the time limit, and live another day to end the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That’s what Tenko thinks, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says, letting out a deep breath. “I think I’m going to stay here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She spies the briefly perplexed look on Kokichi’s face out of the corner of her eye as Tenko says, “What? Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know I said I would be right back and stay with the others,” Kaede says. “But after what Kokichi and I discussed, I think it’s more important that I stay here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kokichi says. “Akamastsu-chan, did you forget? We already finished our talk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We finished the first part where we compared notes,” she says. “Now we need to move on to the part where we,” she takes a moment to force herself to smile encouragingly. “Where we think about what we do next—after the time limit’s over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Are you saying you’re just going to… lock yourself away from everyone else?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just until the time limit’s over,” she says quickly. “And then when everyone’s calmed down, and we hopefully have a better plan, we’ll come out and rejoin everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi adds, “Stop saying ‘we.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” Kaede adds, “Tenko, you already have Ryoma to take care of, and Kiibo, and probably Kaito, too, in case he… actually tries anything when we get to the end of the time limit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko knows that, but that doesn’t mean she can’t protect you, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know, and I do trust you,” Kaede says. “But I also want to stop sitting around feeling useless and making you worry about me all the time. I want to help and maybe actually try doing something a leader would again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes fall to the ground as she just says, “Kaede…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Kaede says, preparing to lie. “I’m really scared. I do believe in you, but… I think you’re right about Maki, and the more walls of steel I have between me and an attempt on my life, the better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t miss the look Kokichi gives her for a second even as she refuses to glance down at him. Tenko says, “Tenko, ah…” she bites her lip, fidgeting in place for a moment before saying, “Are you sure you’re safe in there? No secret entrances or ways someone could break in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The electrohammers would probably take out the barrier in front of the shutter,” Kokichi says. “Buuut that’s why I have the Exisals standing guard over it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See?” Kaede says. “We’ll be—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But, most importantly,” Kokichi continues. “I don’t want Kaede to stay. So,” he turns to her and waves his hand dismissively. “Shoo, shoo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks between them as best she can. “Kaede, Kokichi’s not… holding you hostage or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The opposite of holding someone hostage, actually,” Kokichi says before repeating, “shoo, shoo,” again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Also,” she says to Tenko. “I’m sort of in the middle of fighting an uphill battle to try and get Kokichi to cooperate with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems to show distaste at the idea, curling her upper lip. “Kaede, Tenko trusts your judgment, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “But there’s a reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If that reason is that you’re madly in love with me,” Kokichi says. “Then I need you to know Kaede that I would have less than zero interest in you even if we weren’t trapped in a killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares down at him. “I’m trying to work with you because I know you’re not the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks at her. “You know for sure that Kokichi’s not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says. “And he knows it can’t be me either, and I think that’s why he invited me here in the first place because whether he likes it or not,” she sends a pointed look to Kokichi, “I’m the only person he can trust, and we’re too desperate to not work together anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know you’re both not, uh,” Tenko glances to the ground for a moment before looking back at Kaede, something different in her eyes. “Then… do you know who killed Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her chest suddenly tighten up in sympathy. “Ah, no,” she says. “But, like I said, we’re going to keep talking through things and try to find out who did. And I promise we won’t stop until we figure it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, and says mostly to herself, “That’s good… ah, but,” she looks up again at Kaede. “Will you really be okay down here? Remember, Tenko said that you don’t need to do anything to put yourself in danger for our sa—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “And I think this is the best thing I can do to keep everyone safe, including myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s that same sadness in Tenko’s expression that makes Kaede’s heart hurt as she lowers her voice to just above a whisper. “Also… Tenko knows you trust Kokichi, but please be careful… doing anything he says, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will,” Kaede says. “And I promise this will be over really soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says softly. “Tenko will guard the electrohammers to make sure no one can get in, and she’ll come by tomorrow to check on you—just… please don’t die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels the strain on her fake smile nearly break it, and she doesn’t think for a second that Tenko will believe any of her optimism even as she says, “I won’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods to herself again. “Okay,” she says. “Okay… um, should Tenko tell the others what’s going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi finally speaks up, startling Kaede at his presence. “They’ll figure it out eventually. I mean, the others are dumb, but they’re not <i>that</i> dumb. Well, most of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his words, Kaede suddenly feels immensely grateful that he opted to stay silent while she was reassuring Tenko. “I think,” Kaede says. “That it’s probably alright. Tsumugi and Ryoma will probably figure it out since they were there when we left together. And I don’t think Kaito… or Maki would appreciate being left out of the loop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze, tell everyone about my secret hideout,” Kokichi says. “Oh, well, it doesn’t really matter since the mastermind already knows anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Tenko supposes that is right,” she says. “And… Tenko will try to do what she can on her end, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “And make sure you’re safe, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She gives her a slightly broken smile, and Kaede knows that the goodbyes they exchange are probably going against every instinct in Tenko’s head as she finally steps away from the window and out of sight.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a sigh and pulls at her hat, wondering immediately if she made the right choice when Kokichi says, “So, Kaede, now that you’ve invited yourself here for the next few days, I think you should know I’m not giving up my sleeping bag, and you’re going to have to sleep on the floor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses the heels of her palms to her eyes as Kokichi continues to rattle off about which of parts of their food supply strictly belong to him as well as a list of other odd, idiosyncrasies that she’s sure he’s making up on the spot. After letting him go on for a while, Kaede simply sighs before saying, “Alright, fine—I get it. Now can we actually work on getting out of here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi skips away from her saying, “sure, but only if you can keep up, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rather than launching into any sort of discussion, when Kaede sits back down in front of Kokichi, he opts to hand her one of his many notebooks with the only instructions being to “try and catch up.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She can’t help but scowl at the obvious barb against her intelligence but finds what she can make out of his various scribblings to be more absorbing than she would have first thought. For the most part, they make little conversation other than Kaede occasionally asking him to clarify something he wrote down or him asking her for seemingly random information about their lives at the school.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even with her new focus, Kaede also finds part of her needs the constant internal reminder that the time limit is just a bluff in order to keep herself calm. She remembers during the first time limit, the sheer urge to do anything had been so consuming that she had started arranging her murder plot before her brain could even catch up with her. She takes a deep breath as she keeps reading and promises herself that this time will be different.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi occasionally checks his monopad for the time and casually announces dinner when he tosses a bag of rather cheap looking potato chips at her. The only other interruption in what Kaede begins to think of as their studying session comes about an hour after that in the form of a loud banging noise like someone slamming their hand against metal coming from the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They both jolt at the sound, and Kaede notices Kokichi reaching for the Exisal remote she knows is in his pocket when Kaito’s voice calls out, “Hey! Kokichi, Kaede! You guys in there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a sigh of relief—though she isn’t quite sure over what—as she stands, calling back, “Yeah—we’ll be right there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She walks to the bathroom and notices Kokichi seems to stay behind, fussing with something. But she pays him little mind and hurries to the bathroom to see Kaito already peering through the window. “Kaede!” he says as she draws closer. “So you guys are just… what, holing up in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles in greeting even as she smells the undeniable traces of blood on his breath and notices how much paler he looks. “Yeah,” she says. “Just until the time limit ends, though. Which I guess also means… I think you’re gonna have to count me out of your plan to go fight Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs, “Kinda figured when Tenko told me what the deal was. Still, though, even if it’s just me, I’m not gonna just sit on my ass waiting for Monokuma to come to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears soft mumbling behind him that she distinctly makes out as saying, “you’re so reckless…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, Kaito,” Kaede says. “Are you alone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks and takes the least inconspicuous step forward Kaede could possibly imagine to block out whatever she could make out behind him even more so. “Yeah, uh,” he says. “Just me. Anyway, what are you guys doing in there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow, considering how to interpret his incredibly bad lying more than how much to reveal to him. “Well,” she says. “Mostly we’re just trying to figure out how to stop the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” he says. “Do you have a plan for how to beat them before the time limit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh, not quite,” Kaede says with a slight wince. “How about you and Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “I told you it was just me here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t say it wasn’t,” Kaede counters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears a sigh of deep exasperation from the other side as Kaito says, “But, nah, right now we’re mostly just… tossing some ideas around. We have tomorrow and then the morning after, so we’re running out, but there’s still some time left. And,” his voice shifts from the forced casual one he had been putting on to something deeply serious, “I know neither of you trust Harumaki, but she’s not just this… mindless killer you think she is, alright? And she wants this game over with as many of us alive just as much as anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede waits a second to respond in an attempt to see if she can catch Maki saying anything else, but the other girl remains frustratingly silent. “I’m sorry, Kaito,” Kaede eventually says. “I just… I don’t believe in her as much as you do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaito says with a sigh. “But, she promised me she wouldn’t kill anyone, and I believe in her. So yeah, I know you don’t feel the same way, but you can at least trust in her a little.” Kaede gives him a dubious look that she takes he did not like as he finishes with, “You can treat her like a person and not a monster.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Perhaps it’s Tenko’s warning or the fact that some, small part of her is resentful over having to barricade herself for her own protection, but Kaede finds herself saying, “However she acts, that’s how I’ll treat her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito sighs. “You know, if you convince yourself that someone’s a piece of shit, then that’s all you’re gonna see, and you’re probably gonna miss the person they actually are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Maki shifting slightly behind him, and can only briefly wonder why she’s fidgeting when a much louder call of, “Ooh, ooh, is that Kaito? I want to talk to him!” echoes behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glances back to see Kokichi bouncing on his heels and rolls her eyes before returning to look at Kaito. “I know we were in the middle of something, but do you mind talking to Kokichi for a bit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Sure. According to Tenko, this whole thing was his idea in the first place, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I mean, I kind of decided to force my way into it actually, and—Kokichi, would you stop shoving me?” She interrupts herself to address Kokichi currently pushing impatiently at her side. With a frustrated sigh, Kaede steps away from the window saying, “Fine, fine—I already said I was going to give you a turn, geeze.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi ignores her entirely to hop into place. He stands on his tiptoes and grips the opening of the window to slightly pull himself up in order to barely peek out on to the other side as he had done the first time Kaede saw him using the window. She hides her smile behind one hand at the rather amusing image as he says, “Hi, Kaito. Welcome to my secret hideout.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Kaito let out what sounds like the most genuine laugh she has heard in a long time, and looks over to see him smiling down at Kokichi, saying, “Holy fuck—Kokichi, you are so fucking short.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Meanie,” Kokichi pouts. “Insulting me in my own secret hideout.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Maki distantly mumble, “not much of a secret…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sooo,” Kokichi says. “What can I do for you? Have you come to ask for answers to all of my super sinister secrets?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, not really,” Kaito says. “I think Kaede answered most of my questions. And besides, I believe in you, so I trust you know what you’re doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi clicks his tongue. “Terrible choice, really.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dude, Kokichi,” Kaito says with a laugh. “I’m not gonna buy the whole ‘I’m definitely evil bullshit’ routine when you’ve literally locked yourself away down here because you’re scared.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smirks at him. “Oh? Is that why I’m here? Are you sure I’m not planning something devious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “Yeah, stopping the mastermind and getting us the hell outta here—really fucking devious. Anyway, I know you’re freaked out by what’s happening, but I already told you I’d protect—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Geeze, Kaito,” Kokichi says. “You really don’t know anything, do you? I know you wanna be a hero, but maybe you should try saving someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says, face incredulous. “Are you trying to get me to believe that me coming to check on you because you hid yourself away and are too scared to leave this room is all about me and my ego?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sticks his tongue out as he lets himself drop back onto the soles of his feet. “Man, Kaito, you got even more boring while I’ve been away. I don’t feel like talking to you anymore—which is such a bummer because I got all excited when you first showed up… I mean, that’s a lie, but, you know, still true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Maki mutter to herself, “that doesn’t make any sense,” and, despite herself, she really can’t help but silently agree with the other girl.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Whatever, man. But listen, I get that you’re trying to do everything yourself—and Kaede probably had to strong arm her way in here—but if you need my help for your plan, I’m ready. I get that you don’t really believe in me, and… I can’t blame you, but I believe in you, and I think that’ll be enough until we can get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi quirks an eyebrow. “And after that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After that,” he continues. “I’m not gonna rest until I make it up to you, you got that? Hell,” he grins triumphantly. “I’m even gonna get you to let down that mask of yours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow,” Kokichi says. “You know, I always knew you had your head in the clouds, but you’re actually completely delusional, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’m gonna get you to stop saying shit like that,” Kaito says before shifting slightly to address Kaede standing back a bit. “Kaede, you’re in charge, right? Make sure Kokichi doesn’t do anything stupid, got it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “You’re saying I need a babysitter? Geeze, first your stupid plan and now this—you’re just full of terrible ideas today!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him as it takes her a second to remember what Kaito’s earlier ‘stupid plan’ was, and, as she recalls it, she can’t help but smile wryly as she says, “I’ll do what I can. Oh, and Kaito—make sure you take care of everyone else, too, okay? Including yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah,” he says as Kaede hears Maki begin to fidget again. “I’ll do everything I can. And,” he grows serious again. “Hopefully one of us will find the mastermind soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yeah—good luck, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t die!” Kokichi calls out cheerily.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just shakes his head before saying, “Anyway, see you guys later, alright?” before stepping back and letting what Kaede realizes is a metal cover fall back over the window.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses by the window for a moment more, to catch pieces of the conversation Kaito begins with Maki as they walk away, him saying, “They’re really not bad people, Harumaki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she replies. “That’s not what concerns me. You don’t think anyone here is a bad person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But one of us is,” Kaito says back. “I know that, too, and we’ll figure it out together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just,” Maki says, her soft voice now barely on the edge of Kaede’s hearing as she walks further and further away. “Don’t let your belief trick you. You say it’s your own fault if you get betrayed, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They round a corner and the rest of her words become indistinguishable. Kaede sighs as she finally turns to address Kokichi still patiently standing next to her. “You were listening in,” he singsongs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And are you going to tattle on me next time they come down here?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maaaaybe,” Kokichi says. “But Kaito’s a dummy who believes in you, so he probably won’t listen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know,” Kaede says. “You could probably stand to be a little nicer to the one person here who actually likes you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi snorts. “Oh, please—and how do you know that’s not a lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, he starts to walk off, Kaede frowning as she trails after him. “You think he’s lying about trusting you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think everyone besides you and me might be lying,” he says, before shooting her a glance over his shoulder. “But then again, we like our lies a lot, too, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stops in her tracks and crosses her arms. “Are you saying you think <i>Kaito</i> might be the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, he could be,” Kokichi says as he sits back down on his sleeping bag. “Picture this: terminal illness patient wants to be a hero before their death and sets up a killing game where everyone will love them as one last hurrah! What do you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s horrible!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “So it is, but what about this—you’re the mastermind, and to throw everyone off your tracks, you befriend one of your victims and then act super heart broken over their untimely death to garner sympathy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at him openmouthed. “Tenko? She’s your pick for mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says with a casual shrug. “But that’s how she’d do it. Ryoma’s pretty similar—though with a hardcore case of faking depression thrown in—Tsumugi would just be a girl too boring to be the mastermind hiding in ‘plain’ sight, and Maki who’s so obviously violent and unstable that you assume she isn’t the mastermind to the point where it’s a twist when she is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Kaede presses a hand to her forehead, trying to think how to process what’s coming out of his mouth. “You are… really <i>fucking</i> paranoid. You suspect everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just everyone who I don’t have proof isn’t the mastermind,” he replies airily. “So to answer your question, no I don’t really trust Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just shakes her head. “Because you trust literally no one. How long have you been like this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles but there’s something else Kaede can’t quite place shining in his eyes as he says, “That’s what I’d like to know. Here,” he says plucking his remote out of his pocket. “It’s almost night and you can sleep in one of the broken Exisal’s cockpits… unless you love the floor, in which case go crazy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re changing the subject,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And day is changing into night,” Kokichi says jabbing at a few buttons on his remote. “Anything else obvious you want to point out, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scoffs as the green Exisal’s legs slowly bend, lowering it to the ground. “Is that why you act the way you do? You’re just that scared of being betrayed that you’d rather make us all hate you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs as he keeps fiddling with his remote. “Where did you and Kaito get this dumb idea about me being sacred? Do I look like a frightened little baby to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares hard at him as she says, “Kokichi, we’ve all accepted that one of our friends is going to betray us, and that it’s going to hurt. That someone’s going to die, or be executed, or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Try to kill you?” Kokichi finishes with a beaming smile. “See, Kaede, that already happened to me, and I dealt with it, so you’re just kind of full of shit when you try to talk down to me, ‘kay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps watching him for another moment, even as the cover to Exisal’s cockpit springs up with another button push on Kokichi’s remote. “What happened between you two in the virtual world?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smirks. “What—do you want a bedtime story, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sighs as she slowly walks towards the Exisal, shrugging off her backpack with a slight wince as she does. “Kaito told me he would tell me the details but never did—I don’t know if you’ll tell me the truth, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” he says waving a finger at her. “I see now—you’re just an unrepentant busybody.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes as she gently messages the aching shoulder of her hurt arm with one hand. “Sure, why not? So are you going to tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shrugs. “Not much of a story—I figured Kaito was gonna try something before we entered the virtual world, but I also knew he wouldn’t go through with it, so he was my best possible murderer to stick with. We went to Miu’s deathtrap library when I suggested the two of us go alone to ditch Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you purposefully got yourself alone with someone who you knew was thinking about killing you?” Kaede says. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I knew he wouldn’t actually do it,” Kokichi huffs. “Geeze, Kaede—it’s like you’re not paying attention at all. But anyway, he shoved me into a bookcase—which kinda hurt—and then I just looked at him and asked if he was actually gonna do it. And then he got all weepy and got down on his hands and knees and started begging for my forgiveness and all that boring stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends him a skeptical look. “Is any of that true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bits and pieces, but you did ask for my version of events, Kaede,” Kokichi says. “And like I said, Kaito was never gonna go through with it, so it doesn’t really matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And how do you know that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because he isn’t that kind of person,” Kokichi says casually. “Duh.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you still think he could be the mastermind?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi leans backwards to lie down on his sleeping bag and away from Kaede’s searching gaze. “That’s different—one day you’ll understand, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She simply sighs as she slowly lifts herself up with one painful movement into the seat of the Exisal’s cockpit. “Ugh, sure, if you say—what is all this stuff?” she finishes her question in near disbelief at the sheer array of defunct controls in front of her. “Can a person pilot one of these?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says without bothering to sit up. “You’re a person, and you’re in an Exisal with the pilot controls in front of you. I think you can at least put that together yourself, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi—I get it, you think I’m dumb,” Kaede says. “But there’s honestly a lot of weird stuff here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like?” Kokichi drawls.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede reaches curiously for the microphone standing upright in the middle of the Exisal’s controls with a strangely detailed set of buttons directly under it. “Whatever this is,” she says. “It looks like… a microphone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, if it looks like a microphone, sounds like a microphone, and tastes like a microphone,” Kokichi says. “Then it’s probably the sound of you not asking me anymore stupid questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely hears his snide comment over her interest in the strange series of exactly twenty-two buttons under the microphone. She presses a larger switch near them that she takes to turn it on and hears a slight click. “I think I turned it on,” she says into the microphone, her voice echoing across the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sits up then to scowl at her. “Kaede, your voice is annoying enough as is—you don’t need to make it louder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess this is how the monokubs were able to communicate while in these things,” she says absently before reaching to hit the second button in the set. Into the microphone, she begins to say “Why are there—” and abruptly cuts herself off at the sound of Rantaro’s voice reverberating through the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That gets Kokichi on his feet, and he’s at her side in a few hurried steps. “Try a different one,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him before looking back at the panel in front of her, choosing one at random from the middle this time. “This one is,” she says, her voice coming out much softer and higher pitched, “Tsumugi apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They slowly test each one to discover each button corresponds to one of their classmates—alive and deceased, alike—as well as Monokuma and his kids. “It’s clearly a voice changer,” Kaede says as Kokichi continues to fiddle with it. “But… why is something like this even here? And why is it able to replicate <i>our</i> voices?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good question,” Kokichi mutters softly, still looking over the controls.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know Monokuma said this school was built for the sixteen of us, but,” Kaede frowns. “I don’t think we were ever supposed to see the insides of the Exisals, let alone sit in one and pretend to be someone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond, instead opting to continue examining the defunct Exisal far too late into the night.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I had something happen to me that was a first for this fic, which is I ended up writing a chapter and realized I needed to split it into two parts in order to not just have a huge monster chapter randomly in the middle, haha. But because of that, the next chapter should hopefully be out in a few days rather than next week if all goes well!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The first thing Tsumugi felt when she woke up that morning was worry. There was now only a little over twenty-four hours left before the time limit expired, and she had little idea if any of her classmates were actually going to act on the plans they had been tossing back and forth. Yesterday had been both tense and awkward. Though Ryoma and Tenko had been cordial enough, it was obvious they were acting as if they were in the presence of a stranger, rather than the trusted—albeit currently rather suspicious—Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Of course, she doubts that can be helped.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Kaede and Kokichi effectively removed themselves from the other students to launch their own plan to thwart the mastermind, it was now only the five of them, and if nothing interfered, Tsumugi had the sinking suspicion that there would be a death among those still in the school, or the time limit and whatever it would bring would end without contention.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi decided to wait just outside the dorms for Ryoma and Tenko to finish getting ready in order to walk with them—she had learned her lesson waiting with just Maki and Kaito in the cafeteria before. Even with the stress of time slipping away, she simply waited, fiddling with her hair until Tenko and a very disgruntled Ryoma emerged from the dorms.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sensing the tension, Tsumugi asks, “Ah, is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede took all of Tenko’s painkillers with her,” Ryoma says, grimacing with each step.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko’s going to her lab to try and see if she can find more,” Tenko says quickly. “Tsumugi, would you mind walking Ryoma to the dining hall?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, of course,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shakes his head. “Can be alone for five seconds, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scowls. “Tsumugi will help you if you fall. Tenko is not going to have an argument about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just sighs before Tenko spins on her heel to run off down towards the lower part of the school’s campus.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Tsumugi says, suddenly feeling very awkward with just the two of them. “Shall we go then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma clenches his jaw as he takes another step with his crutches. “Right behind you,” he says darkly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The silence between them is deeply uncomfortable—at least for Tsumugi—as they move at a rough crawling pace towards the school building. “So,” she says. “Ah, it’s a bit strange Tenko decided to go to her lab for painkillers instead of yours or, you know, just the warehouse since those are closer to the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She wants to check on Kaede,” he says tightly. “So it’s gonna be a while before she gets back.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “I… I suppose that makes the most sense, doesn’t it? Also, I know Tenko really cares about Kaede, but… isn’t it plainly weird that she and Kokichi would lock themselves away somewhere now? I mean, I know the machinery bay wasn’t available until now, but they could have picked somewhere else during one of the other motives… if that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stays quiet for a moment before muttering, “You wanna know ‘why this motive?’ That it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” she says, suddenly feeling slightly embarrassed at his scolding tone. “I guess. Though, I guess it does make sense that Kaede would react badly to a time limit motive given… what happened with Rantaro. And, well,” she hugs one of her arms. “I know Kaede doesn’t really seem inclined to give it, but I still wish we knew why that happened… and why she was able to get away with…” She shakes her head. “I’m sorry—I shouldn’t have brought it up—it’s just plainly too horrible to think about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says after a moment. “Guess it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The rest of the trip is made in awkward silence, but they make it to the cafeteria soon enough without any delays.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hurries inside to hold the door open for Ryoma. Kaito and Maki both seem to jerk up to look at them, and Tsumugi already launches into an explanation of their situation without glancing back to them. “Ah, good morning—Tenko is probably going to be a while, so it will just be the four of us for breakfast probably. Is that,” she finally looks over to see the deeply serious expressions on their faces. “Okay…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki and Kaito share a tense look before Maki lets out a sigh and steps slightly to the side to reveal a pristine Flashback Light sitting on the dinning table. “This was here when we arrived,” she explains. “We were just talking about why Monokuma would give us something like this now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he wants us to remember something before we die,” Ryoma says, slumping into a chair. “Which means it’s probably just to taunt us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “I dunno about that, but I have a feeling it’s not gonna be anything great. If the outside world really is turned to shit…” He shakes his head. “Maybe it’s a good thing Kokichi and Kaede aren’t gonna see whatever crap it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know if any of us should use it,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “What? Why not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have a bad feeling about it or something?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arm. “It’s just… strange. What is the point of this being here now? We would always find the Flashback Lights when we explored the school—they never just… came to us like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s right,” Tsumugi says. “We didn’t find a Flashback Light when we were searching the school this time, did we? So maybe we… didn’t search the right place, and Monokuma just got frustrated?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be,” Kaito says, rubbing the back of his head. “I know we… were all sorta pissed off at each other when we were exploring, so, yeah, we might have just fucking missed it or something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps frowning, but she says, “I suppose.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway,” Ryoma says. “We’re gonna have to relay whatever’s in it to Kaede and Kokichi, but should we wait for Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “She’s visiting them down there, right? Well, if they’re still all together by the time we’re done, we could just tell them all at once.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “Should we just use it now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t see why not,” he says, casually picking it off the table. “What do you think, Harumaki? I’m only gonna do it if it’s unanimous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares hard at the Flashback Light in his hands, taking a moment before saying, “Fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not like we have a lot left to lose if it’s something awful,” Ryoma says. “World’s destroyed, and the time limit’s ending tomorrow morning. Might as well figure out one last thing about ourselves before we die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a pretty… hopeless way to look at it,” Tsumugi says. “But I guess that’s just the way things are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks over each of them and nods one last time in confirmation before flipping on the switch.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t think she’ll ever quite get used to the dizzying, racing feeling of the Flashback Lights seeming to sear memories on to her brain like a cattle brand. Of course, as the memories of a great school full of hope they all attended together begins to swim into her mind, a more realistic part of her remembers that at the end of the day, they really are little more than sheep for the slaughter.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The school in their new memories is bright and glowing and they were heroes, first running from the Gofer project, but then coming back to be humanity’s last great hope. But hiding among them since the beginning with the intentions of throwing them all into one final killing game was the leader of the Remnants of Despair. Someone who they had thought of as a friend, but had lied to them and kept far bigger secrets than any of them could have dreamed—someone who had already killed one of their friends in cold blood—someone who wasn’t even there to see the memories of their betrayal.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The memories fade back at leaving them all reeling. Tsumugi distantly hears Maki mutter, “What?” in something close to disbelief.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks absolutely shocked to the core. “I don’t—I don’t fucking believe it—this has to be…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a deep breath, “Take it we all remembered the same thing then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yeah,” Tsumugi stammers. “The—the leader of the Remnants of Despair… Kaede Akamatsu had been… hiding and lying to us this whole time…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the exception of Kaito cursing to himself, they all go quiet, just letting the information sink it when the door to the cafeteria pushes open.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s already talking as she enters, saying, “Kaede and Kokichi are alright—Tenko doesn’t think sleeping in the Exisal hanger is good for their health, but they are both…” she seems to notice the atmosphere of the room all at once. “Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but feel herself becoming increasingly nervous as the day stretches on. Kokichi seems as relaxed as ever, and only responds to her worries about the time limit approaching or their distinct lack of visitors since that morning when Kaede directly asks him.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe Kaito had another coughing fit and keeled over,” Kokichi responds while examining his nails. “Or maybe Monokuma ended the time limit early for everyone else and they’re all dead—what a tragedy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, you seem really torn up about the idea of all our friends being dead,” Kaede says as she paces. “I mean, I know it’s not even evening yet, but Kaito said he’d come again today, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe Maki got tired of him running off on his own and cut off both his legs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls a face at him. “Don’t say weird, gross things like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi rolls his eyes and goes back to sorting through his notes. Kaede can’t say looking through his theories about the nature of the game was a waste of time as some of the arguments he had put together seemed rather convincing in light of her own experiences. His main focus seemed to be on why the game was put together the way it was—the adherence to the rules and the need for excitement. It almost seemed as if he thought the entire game was some strange story that required them to succeed sometimes and needed a certain ending—though the specifics of the ending was one of the few things even he appeared to be unsure about.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Of course, the biggest thing from his notes was the idea that they were being watched. There was an audience somewhere, and the game depended on that audience to keep watching. Kaede was rather baffled at the idea that anyone would want to watch something so horrific, but Kokichi was absolutely convinced as far as she could tell.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Currently, Kokichi was busying himself with trying to map out where everyone had been at certain times with some input from Kaede about her own memories on the matter. He managed to absorb himself in the project, but Kaede continued to pace.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The monotony of their situation since that morning had been broken only by Tenko’s visit, and was only broken again a few hours later by another frenzied knocking sound coming from the bathroom. Kaede immediately jumps up to race to the bathroom window, while Kokichi continues his habit of taking his sweet time for what Kaede assumes was a self-important need not to seem too eager.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She personally had no interest in such a thing, and smiles brightly as she rushes to the window to greet a rather nervous Tenko strangely looking behind her shoulder rather than through the window as Kaede approaches. “Tenko,” she says, causing the other girl to jump. “We’re alright in here—maybe a bit stir crazy, but alright. Is everything out there—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says hurriedly. “Tenko can’t be here long or the others will get suspicious, but,” she glances behind her again, biting her lip.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Kokichi approach behind her saying, “‘Suspicious?’ Did you murder someone, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, that’s not funny,” Kaede says, though she pays him little mind. Tenko looks possibly more on edge than Kaede has ever seen her, and she can’t help but feel a deep sense of dread forming in the pit of her stomach. “Tenko, is everything alright? Why can’t you be here long?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets with something in her arms for a second before sliding a monopad through the small window, explaining the action with, “Tenko didn’t think she would have enough time to go over everything, so she got Kiibo to record it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she takes the monopad. “Record what?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi immediately leans around her to get a look at it. “Hey, Kaede, why don’t you let me see first while you and Tenko have your heart to heart, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks to Tenko for reassurance for a second and the other girl still seems anxious but nods as she passes the monopad to Kokichi, who merrily skips away with it. “Hey, Tenko, I know you said you don’t have a lot of time, but are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Do you—um, have you ever heard of the Remnants of Despair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No?” Kaede says, furrowing her brow.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Never?” Tenko asks. “Just—tell Tenko you have no idea what that is, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The panic in Tenko’s voice is starting to scare her, but Kaede says, “I’ve never heard of the Remnants of Despair until literally right now. Are they… a band or a… support group or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko says to herself, seeming to have finally calmed down slightly. “Okay. One more thing—you said you and Kokichi know for a fact that neither of you can be the mastermind. Why is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s slightly taken aback at her question, but answers, “Uh, well, you remember when Kokichi handcuffed himself to me? Well, we didn’t get them off until after the blackout, so we were together the whole time including when Himiko was killed, and… the only person who could have done that was the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kokichi can confirm that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s mad I’m staying here, but I don’t think he would have let me in at all if that didn’t happen,” Kaede says. “But, Tenko, is everything really okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says letting out a deep breath. “Tenko just thinks… there’s been a horrible, horrible mistake—it’s the only thing that makes sense. But, um, make sure that you’re safe tonight, okay? Really, really safe against anything that might happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at her in confusion when Kokichi reenters the room. He shoves the monopad in Kaede’s hands without even looking at her and stands on his tiptoes to slide a piece of paper through the window to Tenko. “Hey, Tenko, since you’re a double agent, already, would you mind doing a super secret mission for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Kaede asks as Tenko hesitantly takes and unfolds the note.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means you should really watch Kiiboy’s video,” Kokichi says. “And Tenko, if you share that note with the enemy, I’m going to be really mad and take my anger out on Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will… try,” she says looking up from the paper. “Um, and you be careful, too, Kokichi, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo, don’t tell me what to do,” Kokichi says. “But yeah,” he folds his hands behind his head and smiles happily. “Guess giving you guys those first electrohammers to get you off my back turned out to be a bad idea, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes suddenly widen in panic. “Tenko is going to go check on those right now,” she says. “A-And then she will try to do… ‘your mission.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See that you do!” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just looks between them trying to figure out what is possibly happening when Tenko shifts to address her. “Goodbye, Kaede—and please make sure you stay safe tonight, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will,” Kaede says despite still being at a complete loss.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s sheer nerves do little to make the smile she gives them before speeding away look convincing, and with her gone Kokichi simply says, “Kaede, I think you made someone really angry,” as he reaches out to tap the monopad in her hands’ screen. “To tell the truth, I’m actually almost impressed. Be more impressed if it didn’t mean we’re now both probably going to be killed, but that’s life, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at him in bewilderment before reaching down to finally turn Kiibo back on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” he greets her. “I assume there is little time for pleasantries, and you would like to see Tenko’s video, correct?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “I think that’s what’s happening here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” Kiibo says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The screen briefly fades to black and Kaede registers that Kokichi is now standing on his tiptoes next to her, though he seems more focused on whatever her reaction is going to be than watching the video a second time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears sounds of shuffling coming from the monopad and glances back at it to see what she is fairly certain is a view of the underside of the dining table in the cafeteria. It immediately occurs to her that Tenko probably recorded this without the others’ knowledge when the echoing voices in the video begin to sharpen into something recognizable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—something we’re missing!” she hears Kaito say. “Like, there has to be another fucking Flashback Light somewhere that we never found, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it what?” Maki says. “It’ll completely contradict what we just saw?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t fucking know—maybe!” he says back, something close to frantic. “Or it’ll at least explain this shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s softer voice is harder to make out, but Kaede can hear her mumbling, “That’d be really nice, wouldn’t it? If there was some other… less horrible explanation. I want to believe that’s true, and it’s something we could find, but—these are just plainly our memories, right? Is there any explaining that away?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a frustrated sigh. “I don’t know. Fuck—I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Have a different question,” Ryoma says. “So, Kaede’s locked up with Kokichi, right? Knowing that, what are the chances he survives the time limit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s voice is much louder than the others due to being closer to the monopad, and every note of distress comes through bright and clear as she says, “What are you saying!? Kaede would never—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It turns out we all thought she would never do a lot of things,” Maki says. “Of course, we already knew we were wrong about that, but that still wasn’t enough to finally convince us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, this is just a theory,” Tsumugi says. “But do you think that maybe Kaede wanted us to figure it out earlier when she revealed that she killed Rantaro? But… we didn’t, so she just left the Flashback Light so we couldn’t deny the truth anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, her confusion fading to a dull but rising horror. “Would that make the Flashback Light a ‘come get me’ thing, then?” Ryoma says. “The Remnants of Despair hated boredom, so… maybe she got bored.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t make any sense!” Tenko insists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says with a sigh. “You didn’t see the Flashback Light. The Remnants of Despair, and fucking… Enoshima Junko—boredom and despair was like their whole thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaede isn’t like that!” she shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know!” Kaito yells back at her in a sudden spike, before letting out a sigh. “I know—at least I thought I knew, but it’s pretty fucking hard to just argue with your memories.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “It all seems so real that I plainly can’t believe I forgot in the first place. And… it makes sense, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps before shouting, “T-Tenko already told you—none of this makes any sense!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re talking about what happened with Rantaro,” Maki says softly. “If Kaede wanted this game, then it’d make sense that she’d try to get it started with the first murder… and then also make sure she’d survive the trial so she could keep the game going.” Kaede hears her shift slightly, and something close to doubt seems to creep into her tone. “However, that would mean she also knew Shuichi would do what he did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their conversation continues, but Kaede can barely process it, muttering aloud, “what is this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A desperation move,” Kokichi says. “The time limit’s ending tomorrow morning, and the mastermind’s making their move. Keep listening,” he nods at the monopad. “Tenko happened to record something interesting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes briefly flicker over him, and—even though nothing interesting is happening on the screen—she dutifully returns to watching the video. She tunes back in to catch Ryoma saying, “debating whether it’s true or not isn’t going to get us anywhere. Real question is if this is Kaede revealing herself, what are we supposed to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “Ryoma, you mentioned it earlier, but does this mean Kokichi is in danger? Should we… go rescue him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaito says. “We should at least try and talk to her, right? You know, figure out what the hell is going on? I mean, for all we know, maybe she lost her memories, too, and has no idea about any of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which would mean someone else put this here and wanted us to remember that she’s a Remnant of Despair,” Maki says. “That doesn’t—” she abruptly stops, and Kaede desperately wishes she could see what’s happening.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “Harumaki? Something the matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “It’s nothing. I was just trying to think how this relates to the time limit and… the rest of the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tsumugi asks. “I thought we said this was just, well, out of boredom, right? Oh!” her voice jolts suddenly before growing much quieter as she mumbles, “Oh no…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi?” Tenko asks. “Did something happen—did you remember something new?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, no,” she says. “Nothing like that. I just… thought of something horrible. What if the reason Kaede left the Flashback Light for us is because Kokichi’s already dead? And if we try and go to the hanger we’ll find his body and… have another trial…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Don’t know about that—wouldn’t be much of a trial if we already knew who the culprit was, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Maki says. “Though given Monokuma’s obsession with making things ‘interesting,’ he’d probably make us figure out the details anyway. A trial where you already know the culprit… that’s not what Monokuma wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means Kokichi’s still alive,” Kaito says. “End of conversation. And if you guys are that worried about him, I’ll go down to the hanger and check myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But is going there by yourself really okay?” Tsumugi asks. “If anything happened…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “If Kaito goes to the hanger by himself, he’ll just talk to Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that a problem?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be,” Ryoma says. “We don’t know how the mastermind’s getting the footage from their cameras, but if Kaede’s stuck in the hanger with Kokichi, there’s a chance she’s cut off or at least can’t check while he’s watching. Maybe this is our chance to actually do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would the mastermind really do something that fucking stupid, though?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We can’t know what the mastermind’s thinking,” Maki cuts in. “We don’t know what hidden resources they have or what will satisfy their goal other than to not be boring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi asks, “So… is it hopeless to try and guess what their plan is? But if we believe that, then there plainly isn’t anything we can do to end this killing game. And as students of Hope Peak’s Academy, it’s our duty to stop them even if… even if,” her voice grows much softer and Kaede has to strain her ears to make out her whispering, “even if it means killing them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s voice spikes to a yell. “No one is killing Kaede! And if anyone tries, then they’re going to have to go through Tenko first!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, I-I didn’t mean it like that!” Tsumugi quickly amends. “Of course, I don’t want Kaede dead! I was just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Saying how the game ends,” Ryoma says. “This game is obviously created by someone carrying out Enoshima Junko’s will, and a Remnant of Despair—well, who the hell else would do something like this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Maki says, voice soft. “It… it is hard to believe that anyone besides a Remnant of Despair could be the mastermind. It… it confirms everything we’ve been thinking about Kaede, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘We?’” Tenko says. “The only one who thinks Kaede would do anything like that is you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guys,” Kaito says, voice becoming strained. “Guys, stop—stop fucking fighting, alright? We don’t have time for this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a sigh. “Yeah, you’re right. But I just don’t understand what we’re supposed to do now. We have this information, and Monokuma’s attack is tomorrow morning, so should we at least try to defend ourselves?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got the electrohammers, though Kokichi said their charges don’t last long,” Ryoma says. “And—don’t know how much good it’ll do—but we could break the lock off of Maki’s lab and see if there’s anything in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I could,” Maki says quietly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weapons like those won’t do anything against Monokuma!” Tenko protests. “The only person you’d use them against is Kaede! So—so if you try to do that, then Tenko will stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice is calm as she responds, “You’re going to fight me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop, st-stop!” Kaito shouts, though his voice sounds more tired than anything else. “Like hell any of—any of us—a-any…”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He mumbles a bit more to himself, though Kaede can barely make any of it out, and Maki’s voice spikes in concern, saying, “Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He starts to choke out the words “I’m fine,” before giving way to haggard coughing. The others begin to talk over one another, and Kaede hears the sounds of hurried footsteps as she assumes they rush to his side when she hears a worryingly loud thump like something crashing to the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">All Kaede can clearly make out are sounds of Kaito gasping to try and catch his breath between coughs before the video abruptly clicks off. Kiibo’s face reappears, and he informs her, “Tenko stopped recording there and instructed me to remain off so as not to draw any suspicion for the rest of the meeting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kaede lets out a shaky breath, trying to take in what she just heard. “I see. Thank you, Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is no trouble,” he says. “However, with the approaching time limit, I am debating taking action myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Action?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kokichi says. “You mean you’re not completely useless after all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s face shifts to a frown. “Though I am aware it is illogical to place personal feelings as priorities given our current situation, if at all possible, I would prefer not to speak to Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi starts to sniffle. “What? That’s so mean of—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, now is really not the time,” Kaede snaps before turning to address Kiibo again. “Kiibo, what ‘action’ can you do to help us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am unsure,” he answers. “I have been examining my programming and there is one possible command I can execute, though it only has the description ‘for the worst case scenario.’ I am aware it seems to be connected to a different computer somewhere else, but that is all the knowledge I have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth twists into a thin line. “‘Worst case scenario’ sounds kind of like what’s happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It does, however,” Kiibo’s face falls. “Miu was the one who programmed it. And I… I believe it is likely she installed it with the ‘worst case scenario’ being her execution, which perhaps was why she… screamed for me to help her. However, I failed to realize what she meant at the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a pang of sympathy for him, though it’s far overwhelmed by her own panic beginning to drown out everything else. “I’m really sorry, Kiibo,” she says. “But do you think that that would be helpful now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am unsure,” he says. “To be frank, I am mainly considering it due to the approaching time limit. If we are in fact the last survivors of humanity, then I cannot in good conscious allow us all to simply die. It is all I can do for the sake of humanity’s last hope for the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Soooo,” Kokichi says. “In conclusion, Kiiboy has a maybe plan and we have no idea what it does.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In conclusion,” Kaede says. “We need to figure out what the hell the others saw in the Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That seems logical,” Kiibo says. “If you require my services any further, please contact me. In the meantime, I will continue attempting to investigate other potential plans of action.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Alright, let us know if you figure anything out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” he says before flicking himself off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares down at her tense expression reflected back in the black screen of the monopad for a second before squeezing her eyes shut. “So,” she says. “Apparently, I’m a… Remnant of Despair, which is a… person that likes killing games and hates being bored?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And is the mastermind of the killing game, probably,” Kokichi adds. “So, your thoughts, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know this isn’t true,” she says with a huff. “I know the others apparently remembered due to a Flashback Light, but I,” she shakes her head, “I have literally never even heard of the Remnants of Despair until today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nods. “I see, I see,” he says. “But have you considered this—the Flashback Light wasn’t meant for us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A Flashback Light saying you’re the mastermind suddenly appears when the two people who know for a fact you’re not can’t see it,” Kokichi says, folding his arms behind his head. “It just seems like a funny coincidence to me, is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How can a Flashback Light be meant for anyone?” Kaede says. “They’re just supposed to restore our lost memories, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See, you say that, Kaede,” Kokichi says. “But if that’s true, then that means you are a Remnant of Whatever. But that’s…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks to her expectantly, and Kaede frowns as she says, “A lie. You think the Flashback Lights are all lies?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think the mastermind has complete control of this place,” he says. “And the truth is whatever they want it to be. So maybe the truth was that Shuichi killed Rantaro, and then maybe it’s that you did it on accident, and now it’s that you did it because you were evil all along.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a moment before she lets out a deep breath. “They just… care about what makes the game the most interesting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “Look at you, Kaede! Finally catching on. But anyway,” he keeps smiling even as his words grow darker. “The mastermind has decided you need to die to keep the game moving, and now we have to figure out what to do before Maki bursts through the door and kills you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not funny,” Kaede snaps. “And isn’t the whole reason we’re down here is to make sure that won’t happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums as he starts to walk away from her. “True, but you feel different now knowing it’s actually <i>going</i> to happen, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows after him. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi keeps walking towards the front of the hanger, slipping the remote control to the Exisals into his hand. “It means I’m trying to make a decision, and you need to be quiet while I think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that decision is?” Kaede presses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Kokichi’s back is to her, she can perfectly picture him rolling his eyes as he says, “You’re the target, Kaede. So right now I’m weighing the pros and cons of sticking around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gapes at him openmouthed for a moment before admittedly dropping Kiibo to the ground a bit too roughly so she has both her hands free when she marches up to Kokichi to grab him by the shoulder and force him to face her. “You’re what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi immediately wrenches out of her grip, and Kaede notices something shockingly honest in his scowl. “You assumed I meant I was leaving you to die,” he says, twisting his frown into a particularly cruel smile. “Don’t be stupid—if Maki kills you, we have another by the book trial, and Monokuma gets everything he wants. Abandoning you to save myself would only ensure the game continues uninterrupted, and, thus, is not in my personal interest.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what the hell is in your ‘personal interest?’” Kaede says. “And is that literally how you weigh everything—whether or not Monokuma or the mastermind or the conspiracy you think is apparently behind everything would be happy or not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Most things,” he answers with a shrug, returning his attention to the remote in his hands. “But instead of getting all fussy at me, maybe you should actually think about our defenses like I tried to do before you got mad over nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede only raises her eyebrows. “You specifically framed the way you were thinking things over to make it seem like you were debating if you were going to take the Exisals and let Maki kill me. And I’m being unreasonable?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure are,” Kokichi says before directing his gaze to the Exisals still standing guard over the hanger’s entrance. “Especially since I may have talked up our defenses to get people to leave us alone. Because really, all it takes is one electrohammer swing to knock down the barrier, and though I have the Exisals, all I can really do is try to smack someone down with one since actually firing their guns is too likely to result in a fatality and then we’d be back at square one, and I guess there’s the hanger’s alarm, but all that does is tell us when someone’s come to kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “You’re—you’re thinking about all of that right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi shoots her a beaming smile. “Which is why I very kindly asked you to shut up, Kaede—it’s in both of our best interests, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks him over for a moment more before sighing in resignation. “Fine, fine—you spent more time checking this place out earlier anyway. But I’m also not just about to stand around and do nothing. So, is there something I can do to help?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond immediately, but after a moment, he casually says, “Check the time. It’s getting late, and if someone’s going to come, it’s going to be tonight.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at what feels like a pointless assignment, but nevertheless, dutifully slides her monopad out of her backpack with only a slight wince at moving her bad arm. “It’s a little after midnight,” she says. “I don’t know what that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cuts herself off as they both jerk at the frenzied sound of what Kaede recognizes as someone banging their hand against the wall with the bathroom window. She and Kokichi exchange one look, before quickly speed walking towards the bathroom.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s voice calls out to them through the window as they enter the room, and Kaede notices some of the tension seem to fall out of Kokichi’s movements as he skips to the window, greeting the other boy with, “Aww, I knew you couldn’t stay away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Listen,” Kaito says, his voice sounding only a touch less panicked than Tenko’s earlier. “It’s really great to see you’re still doing alright and shit, but is Kaede there? I need to talk to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi puffs out his cheeks but moves out of the way with low protest other than a whiny, drawn out, “Fiiiine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m here,” Kaede says, approaching the window. “And, uh, what did you want to talk to me about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The decision not to rat out Tenko is an easy one, and the lack of suspicion on Kaito’s face quickly lets Kaede deduce the extent of Tenko’s secrecy. “Yeah,” he says. “I just… Okay, this is gonna sound weird and crap, but I need to talk to you about Shuichi’s trial real quick.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She asks, “Why?” despite knowing the exact answer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, why?” Kokichi decides to chime in, keeping his voice to a sickly sweet innocent tone. “Do you think Shuichi faked his death and is the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “No, it’s just,” he sighs. “Kaede, you’re still… you, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” she says. “Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her answer is simple, but for some reason he lets out a breath in relief. “It’s, uh,” he rubs the back of his head. “Sort of hard to explain, but when you guys get out of there, we really need to sit down and talk about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For half a second, Kaede has no idea what the piercing, blaring sound suddenly echoing around them is. Kaito seems to take a second longer, too, asking, “The hell is that—” before his eyes widen in horror, and he darts away from the window, his padded footsteps almost completely drowned out by the shutter’s security alarm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks back to Kokichi, to see him already halfway across the room, remote in hand, and Kaede races after him to catch up.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t bother with turning off the alarm, and the scene of the shutter rolling up to reveal Maki standing there with a black bag slung over her shoulder and what looks like a crossbow in one hand is set to the background noise of what sounds like hell.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Kaito’s voice call out, as he rounds the corner, but whatever he’s trying to say gets lost over the noise of the Exisals Kokichi has poised in front of the door suddenly springing to life. One of them swings its great metal arm, but Maki is far faster. Kaede can barely make out her form speeding past the first one and dodging an attempt by the second one to smack her down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has almost no idea what to do other than stay a few steps behind Kokichi, watching him panic for perhaps the first time ever as his fingers fly over the remote in desperation. She also quickly realizes how handcuffed he is in the situation, as Kaito seems determined to follow after Maki, and Kaede can only imagine how badly being hit by one of the Exisals would hurt him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps moving, everything about her seeming almost completely emotionless, even as Kaito shouts out her name, and Kokichi continues his handicapped assault. Then, for one second, Maki moves out of the pursing Exisals’ reach and into a brief spot of safety, bringing her crossbow up.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The alarm still blaring and the crashing sound of the Exisals’ metal feet are near deafening, but the image of Maki with the light shining off of the metal tip of her crossbow bolt seems like the clearest thing in the world to Kaede. Perhaps even clearer is the fact that she seems to be aiming for Kokichi, still messing with the remote, and Kaede’s moving before she can even process what the hell her brain thinks this will accomplish.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shouts, “Kokichi!” and the other boy’s head jerks up at roughly the same time Kaede tackles him to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi lets out a strangled cry as they land hard on the floor, and while Kaede’s arm is screaming in pain, she’s briefly confused at such a strong reaction to their fall until she notices she was a second too late.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s an arrow embedded in his arm, and he clutches at the entry wound with little other than a brief hiss of pain through his clenched teeth. Kaede stares at him in a mixture of horror and pity until it dawns on her that he’s no longer holding the Exisal remote.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In fact, she only momentarily recognizes that the sound of metal crashing against metal has stopped when she whips her head to the side to see the remote lying on the ground a few feet away from them, likely having flown out of Kokichi’s hands and skidded across the floor.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She immediately regrets the second where she’s torn between checking to see if Kokichi’s okay and diving for the remote as Maki’s already snapping it up into her hand. Kaito runs up behind her, breathing heavily and voice strained from shouting as he yells, “Maki! The hell are you doing!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stay back,” she says, voice detached and barely audible under the noise of the alarm.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t stop moving towards her, reaching forward to try and jerk her to face him, though she remains rooted in place. “Haru—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said to stay back,” Maki says again. “In fact, you need to leave right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shouts in protest, and Kaede slowly rises to her feet while keeping an eye on Kokichi pushing himself up into a sitting position. When she looks back, she notices that Kaito has managed to make his way to be standing directly in front of Maki’s crossbow, despite her obvious irritation.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His voice is softer now, and Kaede can only just make out what he’s saying. “Listen to me, you don’t have to do this,” he says. “Harumaki—look at me, we can talk this through.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not a possibility anymore,” she says back. “I can’t ignore this opportunity to end the game, and if you trust me at all, then you will leave right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though she knows it will do absolutely nothing to help, Kaede cannot help but scoff. “Trust?” she says, and both of them seem to notice her presence for the first time. “Trust? You’re literally trying to commit murder right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, shut up,” Kaito says tersely. “Harumaki, I get what you’re trying to do, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t,” Maki says. “And now you need to leave right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not going anywhere,” he says. “Because I’m going to protect Kokichi, and Kaede, and also you, which means absolutely nothing is going to make me leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki looks up at him, coldly. “The arrow I shot Kokichi with is poisoned,” she says. “There’s an antidote in Shuichi’s lab, and if you want to get it that means you will have to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi lets out a low laugh as he staggers to his feet. “Clever, Harumaki-chan,” he breathes out. “Shoot me, take out the Exisals, force Kaito to leave to get the antidote so you can kill Kaede in peace. I mean, I figured it all out in five seconds, but still clever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, stop,” Kaito says. “Just stop fucking fighting each other for five seconds. So here’s what’s going to happen—you’re going to realize this is a huge mistake, and I’m taking Kokichi and Kaede out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “Leave now or I am going to force you to. I have to end this game now, and I am not going to let you stop me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What? Harumaki,” he says, looking absolutely baffled. “You’re not… you’re not going to hurt me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says, leveling her crossbow again. “I’m not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees Maki spin towards her then registers a near unbearable pain in leg. She hears Kaito shout something as her legs give out from under her, and she sees the arrow protruding from her shin through the sheer veil of pain clouding everything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice sounds almost muffled to Kaede over the roaring in her ears. “—they’re both poisoned and if you refuse to leave—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They keep talking, but Kaede can focus on nothing other than the pain currently surging through her. Their voices seem to swell and fade again in volume while the alarm keeps screaming over them and her hands shake as she moves them towards the shaft of the arrow. Brushing it with her finger tips only sends new shudders down her leg, and she has to bite down hard on her lip to stop herself from making any noise.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s in the middle of fighting a battle to stop herself from fainting, when she hears Kokichi’s voice very close to her, saying quietly, “Kaede, stand up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks at him still completely dazed, “W-What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We have a better chance of getting away if you’re already standing,” he breathes out.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at him at a complete loss until she hears Kaito and Maki’s voices beginning to spike again. “I am giving you an opportunity to leave right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you want me to just choose which one of them I let you fucking kill!?” he shouts back. “And you’re going to die, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not important,” Maki says. “Now take one and leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares hard at Maki for a moment, and is only vaguely aware that Kokichi seems to be waiting expectantly for something when he lunges at her. Maki seems taken aback enough by the action that the crossbow falls from her grip, and Kaito shouts, “Run!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi yanks Kaede’s good arm over her shoulder before she can echo a word of protest other than an involuntary shout of pain when he pulls her to her feet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t falter in speed for a second short of having to physically drag her the first few steps, chattering rapid fire under his breath. “Maki isn’t going to hurt Kaito, but he still isn’t going to last more than a minute in a fight with her. Running away is impossible, so our best chance is to hide and then make a break to the machinery bay’s entrance to call for more help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods weakly. “R-Right,” she breathes out. She dully registers the arrow still jutting out of his arm and the sweat beading thickly on his brow. “Right…” she says again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only when they’re out of the hanger that Kaede feels grateful for the alarm as it covers the sound of their ragged breathing. She also can no longer here any sounds of fighting but also no footsteps echoing behind them when Kokichi juts his chin towards a fork in their path. “There. And try not to leave a trail of blood to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t,” she heaves, “don’t really have control over that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kokichi says, managing to grin in spite of the obvious pain on his face. “But it’s the thought that counts, right, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They shift their awkward staggering down his indicated path, and Kaede’s about to articulate whatever retort back to him that she can think of when she begins to hear yelling again. Kokichi seems to hear it too, and Kaede clamps her free hand over her mouth to stop herself from screaming when he pulls too hard and her weight shifts on to her injured leg.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi guides them to a slightly out of the way alcove, and makes no other movement that to bring one of his thin fingers to his lips. Kaede understands the gesture easily enough even with the muddled state of her brain and does her best to even her breathing to a relatively silent level. Perhaps it’s the pain or the drawn out exposure to the hanger’s alarm, but Kaede finds herself fighting against a determined ringing in her ears to hone into any potential sounds of movement towards their location.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait another moment, before Kokichi says very softly, “we can try and move to a better spot further in if the coast is clear. Then we’ll be super safe for sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">If Kaede had even an ounce more energy, she knows she would call him out on trying to lie or joke around at a time like this, but instead she simply nods in agreement, and they keep moving through the twisting tunnels. Every so often she hears hurried footsteps or what she thinks is Kaito either calling out to Maki, but she has little idea what direction any of it is coming from. And she knows if she has no idea, then Kokichi must be positioning them even more blindly than she could. “Worst case scenario,” he whispers. “Maki’s decided hunting us down is lame and is just guarding the exit. Then plan hide and wait for an opening is a failure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swallows to try and find some of her composure again. “Well,” she whispers back. “Plan A was making a run for it and dying, right? So… this is better.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles wryly. “Don’t know about that. I mean, I don’t know about you, but I’m starting to get curious about what kind of poison Harumaki-chan stuck us with. Nothing fast acting obviously, but, you know, you gotta wonder what’s better—dying slowly from poison or getting shot in the head with an arrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you have to wonder that?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, you don’t, but it keeps me up at night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, I don’t whether that was a lie or a joke about our current situation,” Kaede says, tiredly. “But I’m really not in the mood for gallows humor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs breathlessly. “Right, I’ll knock off the funny guy routine. Instead, all our hope is in Kaito talking her down before she finds us and kills us or the poison does it for her. That better?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Something between making jokes and telling me we’re going to die,” Kaede says, squeezing her eyes shut for a moment. Their banter is a centering point for her mind, but the sheer act of talking feels like climbing a mountain. “Something in that range, please.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re going to die,” Kokichi says, his tone confused of all things. “Why are we both going to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because, ah,” Kaede hisses slightly at a misstep before trying to refocus on their conversation. “Because I’m a Remnant of whatever, and you’re…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smirks. “The word you’re looking for, Kaede, is ‘collateral.’ Or maybe Maki wants to hedge her bets, or maybe she doesn’t like Kaito spreading his loyalties and wants to take out the competition.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “Is she that petty?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi goes quiet for a moment, leaving the ringing of the alarm to echo uninterrupted over them. Kaede can only guess whatever his mind also intoxicated with agony must be thinking when he softly says, “Good question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She isn’t sure how to respond to that, and his voice is labored enough that she opts to give them both the mercy of silence as they wander aimlessly. Kaede channels her energy into staying on her feet and keeping herself quiet—they stop her from looking down at the arrow sticking out of her leg or thinking about how likely it is she might die. She spares glances at Kokichi—who’s wearing a far too serious expression for his childish face—and the arrow in his arm and wonders absently just how high his pain tolerance is.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The next time they speak is when the oddly reliable background noise of the hanger’s alarm vanishes. The silence that replaces it seems even louder, and Kaede is sure that both she and Kokichi stop breathing for the first few seconds of quiet.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, “Someone has to be at the hanger,” Kaede says. “You still have the remote, which means someone went back to turn it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pauses for a moment. “Right,” he says. “Or it could be Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” she says. “But if it is Maki, then we might have a chance to make a run for it. And besides, I’m really starting to doubt she’s just going to get bored and leave. And we also need to get the antidote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond right away, and Kaede has to wonder what the hell he’s possibly thinking over when he finally says, “Exit it is. Lead the way, fearless leader.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that he pivots them the opposite way with only a slight struggle to set them in the direction of hobbling towards the exit. “Hey, Kaede,” he says. “You wanna know something funny?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not really,” she answers, trying to strain her ears to listen for the sounds of footsteps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki gave Kaito a choice in who to save, right?” he says. “I just thought that was funny.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede breathes out, “Hilarious,” as she only pays half attention to whatever he’s trying to tell her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi goes quiet other than the sounds of his ragged breathing and slight padding of his feet on the cold metal floor. Her vision feels cloudier the longer they move, and Kaede begins to feel a slight stinging, prickling sensation creeping up her leg. She grits her teeth and forces herself not to ask if Kokichi feels anything similar, especially as she begins to recognize the path to the entrance again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems to notice, too, and picks up the pace slightly, softly muttering under his breath, “I can’t believe it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth to respond when she hears the sound of someone coughing from up ahead. Kokichi tries to slow down, but Kaede pulls him forward until they turn the last corner to face the exit and see Maki and a very haggard looking Kaito seemingly in the middle of some sort of standoff in front of the door.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glances over his shoulder at them, saying only, “Fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know why you bothered to turn off the alarm,” Maki says. “Or draw this out unnecessarily, but we can finally put this to an end and stop this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just looks at her openmouthed before feeling a tight rage consume her. “Why the hell are you doing this? If you want to kill me, just shoot me now! Do you like seeing us all suffer? Do you really like killing and torturing people that much?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki flickers her eyes over her coldly for a second before saying, “Kaito, just pick one and leave. I don’t care.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re going to torture him, too?” Kaede says. “You’re really going to make him decide which one of his friends he leaves to be <i>killed</i>?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says. “Maki—Maki. Just… just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi laughs. “You guys are all… so funny,” he says, breathlessly. “You’re all acting like this is an actual choice.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shifts beside Kaede, unhooking his arm from around her shoulders. “Kokichi,” Kaito says. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not about what I’m doing—Maki’s demanding either me or Kaede dies to stop the time limit, right?” Kokichi says. “And you’re being a big liar and pretending you’re having a hard time choosing whether to save me or Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks at him in horror. “Oum—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Kaede can think, she feels Kokichi’s hands shoving her forward and the fall to the ground onto her injured leg, sends new waves of pain soaring through her. She hears movement of someone rushing towards her, and everything seems to be swimming when she looks up—up at Kaito suddenly kneeling in front of her, up at Kokichi somehow smiling while agreeing to die, up at Maki watching the entire situation play out before her without a hint of emotion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, then,” Kokichi says. “I guess we’re done here now that we’ve all made up our minds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares at him for a moment before he pulls one of Kaede’s arms over his shoulder, making her hiss in pain. His jaw is clenched tightly as they limp towards the exit where he pauses to look at Maki. “I’m… I’m taking Kaede to get the antidote, and then I’m bringing the rest down here for Kokichi. No one’s… no one’s going to die. Maki…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s face seems almost regretful. “I’m sorry—for a lot of things, but this is how it has to be. Now leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses for a moment more before cursing under his breath and shuffling out into the cold night air. He shifts briefly to give them one last look, and Kaede hears the door close tight behind them. Kaito swears again as they move forward faster now. “We don’t have a lot of time,” he says. “Gotta get you the antidote and then come back and finish talking her down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gapes at him as she struggles to keep up. “You—you do realize what just happened? We just left Kokichi to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, we didn’t,” he snaps. “I’m fucking going back later, and I’m going to save him, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself too dizzy and too disgusted to properly formulate a response, and the next sound between them is Kaito calling out for help when they reach the dorms. They pause for a moment to wait and are about to give up as Tsumugi emerges through the doors, hands pressed to her chest in horror. “Kaito-ku—wha-what’s happening!? Why is Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just help me,” he says. “We need to take her to Shuichi’s lab, and—hey, where the hell is Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I don’t know,” Tsumugi says. “She went up to the fifth floor earlier, so if we’re going there, I guess we’ll see her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grimaces. “Alright, fine. Here, take Kaede’s other arm.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pauses, obviously wary of doing such a thing, and Kaito shouts, “Just fucking do it already—we don’t have time!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi squeaks as she rushes to help, and Kaede would feel a little bad for her if she wasn’t currently very nervous about the odd numbing feeling stemming through her leg.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They’re able to make the trip across the school reasonably fast despite Kaito’s obvious difficulty moving at such a pace and the pain it brings Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The last flight of stairs feels particularly brutal, and she lets out a sigh of relief when they finally ascend to the top of them. However, any such feelings vanish instantly as Tsumugi shrieks, “Tenko!” and drops her support from Kaede to sprint towards the sight of the girl in question lying on the floor in front of Shuichi’s lab.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though she’s very aware walking on her own is a bad idea, Kaede pushes herself away from Kaito and manages to scramble the last few feet on sheer willpower alone to Tenko’s side. She is at an absolute loss for words as she stares down at her and hears Kaito approaching behind them, asking, “Fuck, is she—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says abruptly. “No—n-no, she isn’t—she isn’t—she—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The body announcement hasn’t played,” Tsumugi says suddenly. “I mean, if she was… it would have played, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her rush of emotions, Kaede feels like she could hug the other girl if she had the strength for it. Instead Kaito says, “Tsumugi—you get Kaede, I’ll help Tenko inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Into Shuichi’s lab?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” he says. “And then we’re going to find the fucking antidote, give some to Kaede, and you can watch over them while I take the rest to Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi begins to do as she’s told before staring up at him in confusion. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens and closes his mouth a few times as he hauls Tenko’s body up with obvious effort into his arms, “It’s hard to explain—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right now,” Kaede says. “Right now while we’re talking, Maki is killing Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at both of them wordlessly before saying, “Oh.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I've had all the major plot points for this fic planned out since about the middle of chapter 2, and even back then I knew this chapter would be difficult to write, haha. I also went into writing this chapter expecting some angry responses, so I'll I can really do is assure that this is a mystery with a few more twists about the hows and whys (which is actually my personal favorite part of dr mysteries, though I think most people reading this fic could probably guess that, haha).</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The armchairs in Shuichi’s lab are a great relief for Tsumugi as she only has to awkwardly shuffle a few feet carrying the bulk of Kaede’s weight to one. Tsumugi hovers over her as Kaede collapses into the chair, gingerly lifting her leg with the arrow still sticking out of closer to her.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s face looks haggard and sweat stained, but he moves quickly in depositing Tenko’s body into one of the other chairs before rushing over to the cabinet lined with poisons. He curses to himself about Monokuma likely having restocked the shelf at some point so as to fill it with thoroughly useless chemicals.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes dart between him and Kaede very hesitantly reaching for the arrow in her leg. She tears her gaze away from the former, wanting to spare herself the bloody sight and instead busies herself at the table in the center of the room. She remembers only entering this room once when they had explored so long ago, and though Tsumugi remembers little of the specifics, the bottles set out on the table catch her attention as suspicious. “Um, Kaito,” she says, lifting a small bottle. “I think Maki just left the poison she used right here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s head jerks to her, and he sprints the few steps over to take the bottle from her hands. His eyes run over the label at rapid speed as he mumbles the warnings to himself for reference. “Effective whether taken orally or through the blood stream, yadayada, often in food, odorless—the more you take, the faster it kills you, the more antidote you need to counteract it… got it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods once, thrusting the bottle back into Tsumugi’s hands to search the cabinet again with more precise direction. “There couldn’t have been much on the arrows,” he says mostly to himself as he searches. “But Kokichi’s small, so it’ll probably have a greater effect or some shit… here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pulls away again with a similar looking bottle in his hand and rushes past Tsumugi without a word to Kaede, still debating how to handle removing the arrow. Kaito looks over it with a grimace before saying, “Tsumugi, hold this for a second,” and blindly reaches backwards for her to take the antidote from him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, okay,” she says even as she becomes very aware Kaito has no interest in listening to her response.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He’s already returned to Kaede, saying, “Here, take my hand, and squeeze as fucking hard as you want. And I’ll… I’ll get it in one pull, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede freezes for a second at his words before stiffly nodding. She takes his outstretched hand and clenches her jaw as she says, “Don’t count it down, just do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaito says, focusing his attention on the arrow. He takes a second to examine it, letting out a deep breath before taking a firm hold of the arrow’s shaft. Kaede lets out a sharp hiss, and Tsumugi turns away again, only hearing Kaede’s strangled howl of pain and seeing the arrow roll on the ground in the corner of her vision after Kaito throws it to the side.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s breathing is ragged, and Kaito tears off his coat to press it to Kaede’s leg. Without looking back, he barks, “Tsumugi—give me the antidote and go get bandages or something!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Y-Yes,” she says, taking the opportunity to shove the bottle back into his hands and scramble to the exit of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As she leaves, she catches Kaito saying, “I know this fucking sucks, but we have to be fast. I don’t know how much time Kokichi ha—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s still breathing hard, but she manages to bite out, “Do you think there’s any way you’re actually going to be able to give him the antidote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not gonna fucking give up, if that’s what you’re—” Kaito tears his gaze away from Kaede to Tsumugi still idling by the door. “Tsumugi, hurry the fuck up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right!” she stammers again, this time speeding away to her best guess of where they would keep bandages in the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her trip is uninterrupted as she hurries down the stairs to Ryoma’s lab for all the supplies she thinks might be necessary and back up again. On her way, she passes Kaito, breathing heavily and looking pale as he practically flies down the stairs. He doesn’t acknowledge her presence at all, and Tsumugi pauses for a second in his wake, vaguely wondering if she should still bring the supplies in her hands up to Kaede.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stares after him and thinks about the Flashback Light as she clenches her jaw. No, she decides, pausing here would do little to help them move forward to whatever comes next.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves at a light jog the rest of the way and finds Kaede where she left her, though now with Kaito’s bloody jacket awkwardly tied around her shin and a sour expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kaede,” she says meekly, shrinking slightly under Kaede’s gaze when she turns to her. “I, um, I ran down to Ryoma’s lab, and I think this stuff is mostly for sports injuries, but there’s disinfectant, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Check on Tenko first,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, um, okay,” Tsumugi says, tentatively putting down her supplies at Kaede’s side before scurrying to Tenko still unconscious on the opposing armchair. She spies her chest rising and falling in slight movements, and Tsumugi pauses for a second before placing two of her fingers on Tenko’s neck to find her pulse. “She… seems fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a sigh. “That’s good at least. I noticed some, um,” Tsumugi glances back to see Kaede squeezing her eyes shut and shaking her head. “There’re some weird chemicals on the table.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her before shifting her focus to a few stray, out of place bottles. “You think someone made something to knock her out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think Maki made her something,” Kaede says. “Earlier, you said Tenko was going up to the fifth floor, right? So she told you, and then… maybe Maki followed her or something—I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I suppose,” Tsumugi says. “All I know is that she took one of the electrohammers, and told Ryoma and me that she would be right back… but then when she didn’t return, I just assumed she had gone to visit you and Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She didn’t,” Kaede snaps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes flicker to the ground. “Oh, well, I suppose not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede falters for a moment and reaches up to pinch the bridge of her nose. “Sorry—I know it’s not your fault, I just,” she slumps back in her chair, letting out a humorless laugh as her gaze wanders the ceiling. “I don’t know if I’ve ever been angrier in my life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, you were shot with a crossbow,” Tsumugi says. “I plainly think that would make anyone pretty angry. Oh, and do you want me to treat your wounds now or…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I mean as long as you’re not…” her gaze hardens as she looks at Tsumugi, searching for something in her meek expression. “You—you know I’m not the mastermind, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Tsumugi hugs herself as she stares at the floor. “I don’t really know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs again. “I guess that’s fair. You can go if you want—I’m already hopped up on painkillers, so I can probably handle it myself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, no, I’ll stay,” Tsumugi says offering her a small smile. “Even if my only reason for staying is that I’m a little afraid Kaito might yell at me again. And also scenes where someone helps the hero recover from battle are usually pretty good, at least in my opinion. Well, sometimes they’re boring, too, but it depends on the series.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles wryly. “I don’t think I’m much of a hero, but I would appreciate your help, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi moves to kneel beside her and cautiously unties Kaito’s ruined jacket from around Kaede’s leg to begin treating the rather nasty looking arrow wound. The blood staining it affects her little, and rather, it’s the odd intimacy of the situation that makes her fidget slightly with discomfort. However, Kaede’s stiff expression and gaze firmly focused on Tenko’s unconscious form show just how uninterested in small talk the other girl is.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Time passes silently with the exception of the occasional hiss from Kaede or the slight tick of the overly elaborate clock decorating the room. Too much time passes, and as Tsumugi finally finishes applying clean bandages, Kaede says, “Kaito should have been back by now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi jerks her head to blink up at her. “Huh? Did he say he was going to come back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “But he would have come back to tell us what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, um,” Tsumugi says, sitting back and pulling her knees to her chest. “Maybe he saved Kokichi and is doing what we’re doing in his room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes flicker to her briefly and then away again as she tugs at her hat. “Tsumugi,” she says. “When Kokichi stayed behind, he knew he was volunteering to die—the only person who thinks there’s a possibility he’s not dead is Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says, letting her gaze fall to the floor. “Well, I…” she hugs her knees. “I don’t know what to say, but… I guess this means we’ll survive the time limit, even if it’s plainly in one of the worst possible ways.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shifts slightly in her chair, still looking somewhere else as she bites the inside of her cheek. “Yeah,” she says. “I guess it does.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait longer yet in Shuichi’s lab, unsure if anything will actually change. Tsumugi finds herself drifting in and out of consciousness when Tenko finally begins to stir. Kaede immediately tries to lift herself out of her chair before wincing at shifting her leg, and Tsumugi shuffles to her feet with a quick, “I-I’ll check on her,” to assure the other girl.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rubs at her eyes and blinks confusedly as Tsumugi hovers over her, gently saying, “Tenko? Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks up at her with almost no recognition for a moment before glancing around the room, mumbling, “Tenko is… where is this…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re in Shuichi’s lab,” Tsumugi answers. “We found you passed out outside the door and brought you here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘We?’” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shifts slightly to ensure Kaede is in Tenko’s vision as she continues. “Um, me, Kaito, and Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t seem to hear her and instead simply blinks at Kaede. “Kaede, why are you here? Weren’t you and Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll explain later,” Kaede says. “But what happened to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko was,” she begins before her eyes briefly dart up to Tsumugi and she bites her lip. “Tenko can’t remember. Sorry,” she cradles her head in her hands. “Her head is a mess, but… she’ll try to remember later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe in the morning?” Tsumugi suggests with a pointed glance to the clock. “It’s, uh, getting to be pretty late, and, well,” she wraps her arms around herself protectively. “I think we’re going to have to do an investigation and trial tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares at her in horror before looking to Kaede for confirmation. “What?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Tsumugi is right, we need to get some rest now—I’ll tell you what happened on the way back to the dorms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth pulls into a nervous frown, but she agrees without protest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stumbles the first few steps but ultimately can walk on her own while Tsumugi supports Kaede. The three girls make their way gingerly back down to the dorms, Kaede’s full story of the horrors from earlier that night guiding them the whole way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the dorms, Kaede and Tenko split off from her to spend the night in Tenko’s room, and Tsumugi smiles gently as she waves them goodbye. There’s no question in her mind that the two of them are going to discuss things they think she shouldn’t hear for whatever reason. Her smile doesn’t falter, though, as she reasons to herself that it will all come out into the open when it’s important—the truth has a way of doing that, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They close the door and give Tsumugi a moment to stand in the center of the dorms, simply taking in all of empty rooms surrounding her. There’s been another murder, and come tomorrow, only five of the sixteen rooms should have occupants. The road to this point has been chaotic, but Tsumugi can only smile faintly as she thinks that she managed to make it this far unscathed, unlike so many of the others. But she also thinks that the end is coming soon, and she has few doubts her life will end before it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi goes to bed that night with her same gentle smile still glued to her plain face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma finishes his morning announcement with a reminder that the time limit will be ending in two hours.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a deep breath as she exits her room and stops in her tracks at seeing the dormitory in a surprisingly lively state. Shouting immediately greets her when she exits her room as her remaining four classmates all seem in a panic to rush outside of the building.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s in the back and moving the slowest, and Tsumugi gravitates towards him, asking, “What’s going on?” as they swarm for the doors.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t know,” he says, still hobbling forward. “But there’s an Exisal outside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s head snaps to the glass doors and makes out the distinct blur of an Exisal on the other side. “Why is there—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki!” Kaito shouts as he shoves the doors open. “Harumaki!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s doing her best to run after him, and Tenko keeps herself to her side, prepared to catch her at the slightest slip up. Tsumugi makes out her hissing, “What the hell is she doing here?” as Kaede charges after them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi has little idea exactly what is happening but catches up quickly enough to see the Exisal having come to a stop a little ways from the dorm, the others still jogging towards it in a loose mob.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s the closest to it, saying, “Harumaki, what are you—why are you here?” as he approaches.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi edges closer as the Exisal bends its legs to lower its cockpit to the ground. Kaito stand only about a foot from it while the others more cautiously stay back, and Tsumugi doesn’t miss the way Tenko shields Kaede even as the other girl seems to insist on inching forward.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands nervously and hears Ryoma speak up from beside her, asking, “what the hell is happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” she says. “I think something… really bad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door to the Exisal’s cockpit rises open, and Maki remains seated inside, wearing her same cold expression as if she was simply a bit irritated at too many people saying good morning to her. Her eyes flicker over everyone assembled before her from the nervous and confused Tsumugi, to Kaede practically seething, and finally landing on Kaito staring up at her with pure worry. “I needed to get some supplies,” she says to him alone. “I thought I brought enough with me last night, but it turns out I needed more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Supplies for what!?” Kaede snaps. “What—is Kokichi not dead enough for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s gaze wavers to her for a second before shifting back to Kaito. “If anyone actually cares to listen to what I have to say, I simply needed some more cleaning supplies. If my estimate is correct, I’ll only need about an hour more before the hanger can be explored again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Tenko asks softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That I want to avoid a trial as much as anyone else,” Maki says, voice even. “Part of being an assassin is properly disposing of your target’s body after eliminating them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito isn’t facing her, but Tsumugi can imagine the pained expression on his face as he speaks. “You… you got rid of Kokichi’s body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will have soon,” she says. “If there isn’t a body, then Monokuma can’t hold a trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is disturbed,” Kaede hisses. “You’re just—you’re just expecting us to let you get away with brutally killing someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki doesn’t so much as flinch at her words, calmly replying, “I suppose your other option is to go down to the hanger and force a trial in order to kill me.” She shakes her head. “I can’t control what choice you’ll make, but I already made my decision and I do not regret it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says. “Kokichi was innocent, wasn’t he? Since Kaede’s the…” she looks to Kaede and feels the words die in her throat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Tenko says. “Why did you kill Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses, looking over them before reaching for the Exisal’s controls, causing it to rise back up to its full height. “I’m not here to answer questions,” she says. “I just need to end this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki reaches up to pull down the cover to the Exisal’s cockpit, and Tsumugi barely hears Kaito say, “Maki…” before she disappears from view.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He calls after her again as the Exisal stomps off away from them. It doesn’t pause for a moment in its descent back towards the hanger, and Kaito runs both his hands through his hair as he curses to himself. “Fuck—fuck, fuck, fuck…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede trips on her first step past Tenko towards him, causing the other girl to lurch forward to catch her. Kaede groans as she steadies herself, muttering to Tenko, “I’m okay—I’m okay. We need to hurry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma regards her warily. “Hurry where?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“To the hanger,” Kaede says. “If we want to stop Maki, we have to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What!?” Kaito pivots to face them. “You—you want a fucking trial!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone goes silent for a moment, and his voice seems to echo off the walls of the dome. Then—Kaede clenches her fists as she pushes herself off of Tenko to stand on her own, taking a staggering step towards him. “I want,” she says. “To do something about the person who murdered one of our friends right in front of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Since when?” he says. “Since which fucking murder have you wanted to see someone get executed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want—I want,” Kaede throws her hands in the air. “I want justice—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bullshit,” Kaito says, taking a step towards her. “You want revenge—what happened last night was fucking horrible, but killing Maki isn’t going to do a damn thing about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’ll stop the time limit from killing <i>all</i> of us,” Kaede says. “And we’ll all get to stop living in fear of an assassin!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hurries to Kaede’s side, saying, “Kaede, please calm down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “So you admit it! You do just want her dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She tried to kill me!” Kaede shouts. “You saw her try to kill me twice, and you’re still defending her!? How can you still be stuck on this stupid idea that she’s harmless—you were literally there, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you were right!” he yells. “You were fucking right about her from day one—are you happy? Is that how you’re gonna make yourself feel good about sending her to her fucking death!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This isn’t about me! This is about Maki and Kokichi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a hollow laugh. “Really? You really want me to buy that you give a shit about Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I care about him,” Kaede says. “And you actually had me thinking that you did, too—but that was obviously all a lie since you’re defending his killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hears Ryoma let out a quiet sigh as he mumbles to himself, “this is getting out of hand…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She can only silently nod in agreement as Kaito says, “The hell are you saying? Do you honestly think I’m happy about what the hell is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scoffs. “I think that Kokichi is dead, and you’re obviously fine with it since your solution is to just—I don’t know—say ‘oh well’ and move on with our lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So because I don’t want to <i>murder</i> Maki, I don’t care about Kokichi,” Kaito says. “That’s what you’re saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All I’m saying is what’s true,” Kaede says. “Maki’s a killer, but you’re so obsessed with this weird image of her that you made up that you’re willing to let us all die. The fact that we’re even having this conversation instead of trying to find the <i>fucking</i> remains of Kokichi’s body means that you don’t care about any of us and you definitely didn’t care about Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks absolutely furious but his voice is shockingly quiet as he responds. “You know what, Kaede—I guess I did make a mistake with Maki, but I also made a mistake with you. You’re the pettiest, most hypocritical, most vindictive person I have ever fucking met. And—and,” his hands clench and unclench into fists. “And I guess I made a mistake listening to Kokichi last night, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes dangerously. “So you wish you saved him instead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know I should have,” he says. “Because maybe Kokichi was a brat, but he would never be so fucking excited that he gets to kill someone. Because he wasn’t a fucking murderer. And just,” he lets out a humorless laugh. “Kaede—haven’t you killed enough people already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a brief moment of silence as the two stare at each other before Kaede takes one stride towards Kaito. Tsumugi physically flinches as the sound of her palm striking him across the face echoes around them. Kaito reels back a step and looks at her only briefly in shock. He hesitates for one long second before raising his fist and closing the distance between them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s fairly certain he only got one punch in, and the two are physically grabbing at each other to tear at each other’s clothes or get in another hit even with Tenko speeding in to try and force them apart. Tsumugi holds her hands close to her mouth in horror, and the same awful music that sounded like hell the first time the time limit approached begins to start up again. Part of her thinks it’s almost the perfect soundtrack to the sight of two horribly injured people trying to tear each other apart.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Over the din, Tenko screams, “Stop! Both of you stop!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She manages to get in a good enough shove to send them both back a few paces. It’s enough that Kaede falls to her knees with a hiss of pain while Kaito grabs at his stomach and clenches his jaw. Tenko stays where she is between them and addresses both of them again as she says, “Everyone is going to stop fighting right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito punctuates her statement by spitting out blood that hits the ground with far too loud a splatter. He wipes away a bit of blood dripping at his mouth, and the gesture seems to double as a convenient way to muffle one of his now routine coughs. “Fine,” he chokes out. “Then let’s stop fighting and figure out what the fuck we’re going to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re going,” Kaede says, clutching the old wound on her arm as she pushes herself back up to her feet despite the obvious pain it brings her. “To the hanger to find Kokichi’s body, and then have a trial. That is what we are going to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head, hand still to his mouth, though seemingly recovered. “You need three people, so let’s fucking vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Vote?” Kaede practically spits. “On what? Whether just Maki dies or we all die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“On whether we’re going to keep playing Monokuma’s fucking game and kill someone else,” he says. He pauses, shifting to look over all of them. “Tenko, Ryoma, Tsumugi—you have to make a decision right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-What?” Tsumugi stammers. “We’re deciding?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at the ground as he speaks. “If two of us agree with Kaede, we do the trial and Maki dies. If two of us don’t… we let the time limit run out and all die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” Tenko says. “Why are you trying to divide us or force us to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because there’s fucking nothing else for us to do,” Kaito says before glaring at Kaede. “And I personally would rather die than keep being a part of this sick game—but obviously not all of us think that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t react to his words other than to say, “I’m going to the hanger, and I’m going to make sure my friends live. Who’s coming with me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">If it wasn’t for Monokuma’s horrible song playing around them, Tsumugi thinks the dead quiet that would have accompanied Kaito and Kaede’s stares might have caused her to faint. She brings her hands to her heart. “I,” she says. “I don’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not going,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips towards him. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just sighs as he pulls his hat down. “I don’t… care about justice or vengeance—it all just feels the same to me. Don’t really know Maki or Kokichi either, but… this feels like a trap.” He shakes his head. “Tired of trials and doing what Monokuma wants. Maybe the time limit will kill us, maybe not, but I’m with Kaito—done with playing this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma?” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, Tsumugi,” he continues. “You guys can… trust Kaede and go with her if you want, start the trial, too, but… I’m done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Tenko says, her voice full of a raw sympathy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s just one vote,” Kaede says hurriedly, cutting the moment short. “Tenko, you’re coming, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko blinks at her. “Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “You said you didn’t want to keep living if it meant killing people—that’s exactly what the fuck is happening right now. If you go—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we don’t all just die meaningless deaths,” Kaede bites back. “Maki is going to die either way—the only question is if we want to throw our lives away with her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks between them, seemingly at a loss for words when Tsumugi decides now is the best time to speak up, lest she becomes the center of a potential tie breaking vote. “Um,” she says. “I-I think I know what I want to do. I,” her eyes dart to Ryoma and then away again. “I know there’s nothing left for us, but I still want to live. Maybe it’s pointless, but I plainly don’t want to die yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a deep breath. “Fine—that’s fine,” he says, though his tone doesn’t seem to agree with his words. “Just means—Tenko,” he nods at her, “it’s your call.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Also,” Tsumugi quickly adds. “Not to pressure you into making a decision, but I’m starting to worry about how much time we have left. Especially if Maki did… something to make the body harder to find.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glances back at her before saying to herself, “Right—r-right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So… you’re coming?” Kaede says. Tenko jolts to stare at her but simply bites her lip in response. Kaede sighs as she staggers her way awkwardly towards the other girl. “Tenko, I know how you feel—obviously in any other situation doing a trial voluntarily would be out of the question. But this is something we have to do for everyone’s sake, especially Kokichi’s.” Neither Kaede nor Tenko are looking at him, but Tsumugi doesn’t miss the way Kaito rolls his eyes at Kaede’s words. “After everything that’s happened, we can’t just give up here—I… I refuse to just give up here, and you should, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pauses, still clearly unsure of the situation. She hesitates a second longer before saying, “If… Kokichi was killed in the hanger we’ll probably need an electrohammer to reach him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede breaks out in a smile and pulls Tenko into a hug that she seems just a touch uncomfortable returning. Tsumugi still smiles slightly at the gesture even though it’s an almost horrifically morbid celebration. Behind them, Kaito just sighs as he stomps around them, still brushing blood from his haggard face. Kaede’s saying something about how she knew she could count on Tenko, but all Tsumugi hears is Kaito mumbling, “this isn’t over yet,” to himself as he passes her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma seems to hear it to and lets his eyes trail after his retreating form as he speaks. “So, Tsumugi, you… trust Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” she says. “Not really. I mean she is… you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All of us should know,” he says. “But I guess that didn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs. “I know, I know—you’re right, this probably is a trap… but I just really don’t want to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And no one can blame you for that,” Ryoma says finally looking up at her. “Done trying to convince people to die. If you want one of the electrohammers, I won’t try to stop you—you can tell that to Tenko or Kaede, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” she says. “Alright—I guess I’ll… do that. Thank you, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs in response, saying, “Don’t mention it,” before walking back off to the dorms.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When Kaede and Tenko seem to have some interest in her again, Tsumugi informs them of what Ryoma told her, and Tenko volunteers to grab one from her room. She’s alone with Kaede for perhaps a minute or two at most but feels painfully awkward as their only conversation is Kaede saying, “Thanks for coming, too, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede offers her a supportive smile, but Tsumugi’s eyes immediately focus on her disheveled clothes and what looks like the start of a nasty bruise blooming on her cheek. “Ah, it’s fine,” she says to the ground. “It’s plainly nothing, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko returns quickly, one electrohammer weighed in her hands. As she jogs over, she informs them, “Two of the other hammers were missing. Tenko took one last night that she supposes wasn’t returned.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaito probably took the other last night,” Kaede says. She sighs and barely suppresses a wince as she takes her first step towards the hanger. “Really the only thing we’re missing in this case is his testimony from when he went to try to talk to Maki alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have a feeling Kaito might not be, uh,” Tsumugi says. “Particularly inclined to give it right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, but it’s fine,” Kaede says, still moving forward. “It’s not like it changes anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They make the walk to the hanger with little other conversation, and Monokuma’s horrible song seems even louder than ever as they finally approach their destination.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are slight drops and streaks of blood lining their path through the machinery bay’s twisting halls, and Tsumugi doesn’t miss the way Kaede clenches her jaw at their first sighting of them. Even though Monokuma’s music sounds even more demented in the echoing halls, Tsumugi still can’t help but breathe out, “Oh God… poor Kokichi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stiffens slightly at her words, only acknowledging them with a strained nod in her direction. Tenko doesn’t respond at all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The barrier in front of the hanger remains as passive as ever, and Tsumugi takes a deep breath to steel herself for whatever horrible sight she knows is awaiting them on the other side. Tenko steps in front of them, readying the electrohammer in her hands for a moment before crashing the head of it into the barrier with one great swing. The effect is immediate, and the barrier fizzles to nothing before their very eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There,” Tenko says, letting out a nervous breath. “Maki should still be inside, but…” she shifts, unsure how to appropriately finish her thought. “Maki is going to be inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says taking a step forward. “Yeah, she is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They share one final look before Tenko tosses the used electrohammer aside to pull up on the hanger’s shutter with both hands.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A sharp scent of chemicals immediately greets them, but Tsumugi can focus little on it due to the sight before her of an Exisal spinning to face them. Maki’s voice echoes out from it saying, “You—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko screams, bringing her hands to her mouth in sheer horror, and Tsumugi whips her head to follow her gaze to the now closed hydraulic press, a few dark smears of blood encrusted on it despite the obvious attempts to clean them off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She hears Kaede mutter in sheer disbelief, “what the hell…” and then Monokuma’s song cuts off.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A body has been discovered!” echoes through the room. “After some time has passed, a class trial will be held!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki's sigh sounds weirdly distorted coming from inside the Exisal as she says, “Seems like I didn’t do a good enough job for Monokuma’s tastes. Oh well, this still isn’t over yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wh-What!?” Kaede shouts, her composure coming back to her out of sheer rage. “Y-You crushed him to death, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it’s not over,” Maki says. “Where’s Kaito—I think I should speak to him before the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very quietly, Tsumugi stammers, “H-He’s in the dorms, I think…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what the hell are you going to say to him?” Kaede hisses. “Are you going to try and poison him some more about how brutally murdering one of our friends is fine when—where are you going!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She screams the last part as the Exisal begins to unceremoniously exit the room. Kaede stares after it, nearly shaking with fury.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks to Tenko to try and get some guidance for how to react, but the other girl seems to be immobilized by horror as her eyes remain locked on the hydraulic press. Tsumugi glances back to Kaede, and—seeing no other option in how to proceed—hesitantly says, “U-Uh, should we… check the Monokuma File?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no need,” Kaede says, voice deadly cold. “We already know what happened here.” She begins to walk back out of the room. “All we need to do now is wait for the trial and vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words make Tsumugi feel weirdly helpless, and she calls after her, “You’re not going to investigate?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s stomping steps echoing off the metal floor is her only answer. Tenko seems to finally register what’s happening as she says, “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes one step after her before Tsumugi quickly says, “Uh, Tenko, I-I know you want to check on Kaede, but…” she looks back over the crime scene before them. “I… don’t really know what happened and want to investigate—I,” she takes a deep breath to steady herself. “I plainly want to know why this happened—why Kokichi… died the way he did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hesitates. “Tsumugi, you,” her eyes flicker back to the press before forcing herself to look away. “You should if that’s what you need to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know, but,” she lets out a self deprecating laugh. “I-I say that, but I’m also pretty plainly freaked out to be here alone. So, will you help? A-At least just for a little while?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks between her and the exit and back again before she finally says, “Oh… okay. Tenko will help investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs in relief. “Thank you so much. I honestly don’t know what I would have done if you said no.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko tries to smile at her, but the expression only seems to show just how pained she is. “Tenko is… happy to help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” Tsumugi says. “So I—I guess we should start with the Monokuma File?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods, still wearing her strained smile as she pulls her monopad from her pocket. Tsumugi does the same, and it seems to take a second before flicking to life with information that Kokichi Oma, the Ultimate Supreme Leader is the victim this time. His time of death was between twelve-forty and two-forty last night, and his exact cause of death is unknown due to the current state of his body.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi reads that last part again, biting her lip as she glances back towards the press. “So, um, should we try raising the press?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pales at her words, looking almost physically ill as she tries to search for any reason as to why they shouldn’t. “Tenko thinks, um—T-Tenko thinks maybe we should look around for o-other clues first. Like…” her eyes dart around the room, and she swallows before striding over to kneel in front of the press and pick up what Tsumugi notices are a variety of industrial cleaning supplies lined in front of it. “Like these.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi walks over to her, crouching at her side. “Are these what Maki used to try and, uh, hide what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s,” she lets out another trembling breath. “That’s what Tenko thinks. Tenko also thinks that’s why Maki crushed Kokichi’s body. Or… or at least she hopes Kokichi was dead before he…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She trails off, clearly too disturbed by the line of thought to continue it. “Well,” Tsumugi says. “I think that things like this usually have sensors that prevent living people from being hurt, right? Um,” she stands, glancing around the room. “I remember there was a warning sign somewhere around here that said something about it stopping automatically if it detects a living person is underneath…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kokichi was dead beforehand,” Tenko says, nodding to herself. “That’s… that’s good…” her eyes seem to fixate on the smears of blood still lingering on the press. “Tenko just—she just really hopes he didn’t suffer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says, still wandering around the room. “Maki had a crossbow, right? Or at least, Kaede definitely got shot with an arrow. But in any case, if she wanted to kill him, she’d have just shot him, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tenko says as she shakily gets back on to her feet. “Right… Let’s just—let’s just keep looking for clues.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods as she continues to look around. “I guess we should probably raise the—oh!” she rushes over to the cable connecting the press to its controls, specifically a section of it that looks like it was torn and smashed a few times over.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi?” Tenko says, rushing over to her. “What’s… is that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi walks over to inspect it further. “It looks like one of the Exisals stepped on it maybe? I guess Maki really wanted to make sure we couldn’t find the body…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s mouth is a thin line as she silently examines the tear in the cable herself. “Maybe she did…” Tenko sighs and shakes her head. “Tenko just—Tenko doesn’t know about all of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“About all of what?” Tsumugi asks. “The investigation?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko knows she agreed to come here, but,” she bites her lip. “She wonders if that was the right choice because… she also doesn’t think Kaito was completely wrong. Kaede… wanted us to discover Kokichi’s body because she wanted revenge.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “W-What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know if she should be saying this, but,” she crosses her arms protectively. “Last night, Kaede told Tenko why she stayed in the hanger with Kokichi. Apparently neither of them believed the time limit was real, so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t finish, and Tsumugi picks up her line of thought, “So when Kaede was talking about us surviving the time limit, she—she didn’t actually think it would do anything? So she plainly—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she says quickly. “Tenko really wants to believe in Kaede, and Tenko did decide to come here, too, but,” she presses the palms of her hands to her eyes. “Tenko doesn’t know anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi takes a step towards her, hesitantly reaching out one hand to give her arm an encouraging squeeze. “I… I plainly don’t know either. I’ve been kinda lost since everything started, but… I think we already made our choice, so the only thing to do is to… just keep doing it, right? Everyone else has already made up their minds, so I guess it’s up to us to just try and… keep reaching out for the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks to her, still obviously distraught. “Is that what we’re doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure,” she says. “But maybe if we convince ourselves it is, then it will be a little easier to get through. And, maybe it’s depressing, but I think that’s all we can hope for right now. And… and even if it’s silly, I’m still not quite ready to give up on hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods to herself again. “Right—right, Tenko will stay focused. What… should she focus on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, um,” Tsumugi says, a bit caught off guard by the question. “Well, Kaede told you what happened last night, so was there anything in her story that might give us a clue about where to look or maybe anything that seemed off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at the question. “Tenko doesn’t think anything seemed—wait, there was one thing that concerned Tenko. Uh,” she fidgets, suddenly looking very self-conscious. “Tenko may have left Kiibo with Kaede, and she doesn’t think Kaede still had him with her last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So he’s still here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks he should be,” she says, scanning the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a step towards what Tsumugi thinks looks a bit like it was once an improvised campsite. There’s junk food piled in a corner that looks relatively untouched, but they don’t catch her attention as much as the shredded sleeping bag and a few notebooks torn to pieces. The occasional splashes of blood decorating the items also do little to alleviate the general sense of dread the scene radiates. Tenko still walks through it, and seems to take one deep breath before kneeling down to begin rummaging through the mess.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” she says. “Would you mind checking the bathroom while Tenko looks here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, of course,” she says. Though the remaining Exisals in the hanger are either defunct or missing an occupant, having to circle closer to them to get around Tenko, still makes Tsumugi feel slightly nervous. But she supposes they were designed to intimidate, and they serve their job well enough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pushes open the bathroom door and is immediately hit by an even stronger odor of chemicals. It’s almost unbearable, and Tsumugi places her hand over her mouth and nose to fruitlessly deter some of the sick stench.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are more bottles of cleaning supplies she sees scattered around the room, though all of them seem to be empty. However, all of the bottles appear to be plastic and thoroughly in one piece, yet shining pieces of broken glass catch her eye, as does the strange puddle they’re lying in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a brief moment to prepare herself before crouching down to inspect it. Among the remains, there is a rather thick piece that seems to have a label still attached to it. Fearful of whatever the liquid it’s drenched in might be, Tsumugi covers her hand with the edge of her sleeve before she tentatively flips the shard before her over to be able to read the label. It’s thankfully still legible, though slightly covered in blood, and Tsumugi immediately recognizes it as the instructions for the antidote she remembers Kaito rattling off last night.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She frowns at it slightly, thinking this must be the tangible proof of how well Kaito’s plan to deliver the antidote went. Also catching her attention is a black bag shoved against the far wall. Carefully stepping over the puddle, Tsumugi approaches it and opens it with little fanfare.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside is what Tsumugi pieces together are parts of a deconstructed crossbow, a few arrows—one of which she notices is thickly covered in blood. But what catches her attention the most is a knife shining when the light catches the few parts of it not coated in dried blood. She carefully grips its handle to pull it out of the bag and notices the very prominent and rather nasty looking serrations on the blade.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gingerly puts it down as if she were afraid it would spring to life and attack her somehow before she returns to rummaging through the bag. She looks again through the arrows, but still only finds one bloody one. She frowns as she decides the bag has no more clues and can’t help but pace as she tries to think over what her findings mean.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She doesn’t pay too much attention to her surroundings as she does so until on one stride she strays a bit too close to the sink. It’s perhaps the center of the sick chemical smell rising from the room, and Tsumugi notices a few rags that she assumes were dyed red in their attempts to wipe blood away. It’s morbid curiosity that drives her closer even as the pungent smell seems to try and drive her away. Very hesitantly, she reaches down to lift one of the rags still heavy with bloody water from the night before as arms length.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The smell seems to intensify in strength somehow at the gesture, and it takes all of Tsumugi’s metal fortitude to settle it back down in a slightly different spot instead of flinging it across the room in horror. However, as she does so, she notices something else that had been underneath it sticking to the bowl of the sink.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her hand pressed firmly over her nose to take in as little of the smell as possible, she reaches in to grab what seems like a small piece of some sort of cloth. It reeks as badly as the washcloth had, but Tsumugi forces herself to bring it closer to get a better look at it. She rubs it between her fingers and registers that it, too, was probably once a white-ish color before being stained a pale red.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She still isn’t sure what to think of it when she hears Tenko’s voice call out, “Tsumugi! Tenko—Tenko thinks there’s something wrong with Kiibo!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Coming!” she yells, and after a painful moment of indecision, she pockets the small piece of cloth while internally bemoaning its terrible smell and how badly it will stain the inside of her jacket pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s standing in the middle of the destroyed campsite, furiously fiddling with the buttons on a monopad. Without looking up at her, Tenko says, “Tenko found Kiibo, but he isn’t responding to anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi jogs the last few steps over to her, asking, “Is he broken?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” she says. “The monopad appears undamaged, but he still won’t turn on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s—he’s not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says quickly. “He—he is not. Tenko refuses to believe that anyone would hurt Kiibo in his current state. Doing so would just be so pointlessly cruel…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says. “About… pointless cruelty, I think that might not be out of the question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko turns to her in horror, and Tsumugi describes her findings in the bathroom, punctuating it with, “A-And because there was only one arrow that was bloody… it seems pretty plain that Maki probably killed him with the knife.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko clenches her jaw and just shakes her head at the news as if she could just shake away the potential truth of her words altogether. “Why?” she says. “Just… why would anyone do something like this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know, but,” Tsumugi says. “I guess that’s what we’re here to find out. Speaking of which, did you find anything else while you were looking for Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko pauses, needing more time to recover before answering. Finally she lets out a sigh, and shakily says, “T-Tenko found two used electrohammers. Here,” she shoves Kiibo into her pocket and walks closer to the entrance of the hanger. Lying on the ground are two seemingly depowered electrohammers unceremoniously shuffled on top of each other.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tsumugi says. “So, um, one of these was the one you took last night that Maki stole, and the other was probably Kaito? But if they’re both in the hanger, does that mean Kaito got in last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko presses her lips into a thin line. “Kaito,” she says after a lengthy pause. “Is probably not going to tell us what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Tsumugi says. “If Kaito got in the hanger, you don’t think it’s possible that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says sharply. “Kaito—he,” she shifts, irritated with the question in a way she can’t quite put into words. “He’s… he’s awful, but after what happened in Miu’s virtual world, Tenko knows he would not hurt Kokichi. She—she just knows.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says, wringing her hands. “If you say so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares hard at her for a moment but remains silent on the matter. Instead, she says, “Tenko doesn’t know what else to investigate, or if anything we found even meant anything. As soon as we get to the trial, Kaede’s just going to try and call a vote, and… maybe just getting it over with <i>is</i> better than dragging everything out like last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe that’s right,” Tsumugi says. “But I just—I know I’m not that assertive in trials or, well, at any time really, but I just plainly want to know why things happened the way they did.” She sighs. “And maybe we’ll still just vote for Maki, but I guess part of me just won’t be satisfied until all the mysteries are solved.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… doesn’t know about,” she says. “Tenko does wish everyone would stop keeping secrets, but…” she shakes her head. “With the way everyone’s acting, Tenko doesn’t think that’s possible. Everyone working together just—Tenko just doesn’t think it’s possible right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh,” Tsumugi says. “Well, maybe I could try talking to Kaede beforehand, even if… she kinda scares me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “Do you think… do you think she’s a Remnant of Despair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… I wasn’t sure for a long time,” Tsumugi says. “But… I thought a little about what you told me earlier—that Kaede wanted revenge—and, um,” she wrings her hands. “Isn’t forcing a trial to keep the game going something that a Remnant of Despair would do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stares at the floor, still chewing on her lip. Tsumugi presses on, saying, “I also talked to Ryoma, and he said the whole thing felt like a trap, and I’m plainly starting to wonder if maybe he was right. Especially since, well, if we do the trial, then that means everything from Kaede deciding to stay with Kokichi… it’s all just resulted in the deaths of the two people who constantly challenged her.” Tenko doesn’t look up at her, and Tsumugi gasps. “Oh! Sorry, I just went on and on about… something really horrible. I’m so sorry, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko remains silent, and Tsumugi opens her mouth to apologize again when Tsumugi hears a message seeming to echo from the speakers outside of the hanger. She feels she’s heard it enough times to almost recite along with Monokuma how it’s now time for the trial to begin.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says. “I guess that means we should…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tenko says. “We should—right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They don’t say anything else on their way to the elevator, though more shouting greets them as they draw near. Tenko takes a second to straighten her shoulders before jogging the last few steps to reach the source of the commotion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi follows after her to see Kaede, Ryoma, Kaito, and the same purple Exisal Maki was piloting. Tsumugi assumes she’s still piloting it as it seems to shift almost as if it had a body language of its own, and Maki’s voice still echoes out of it. She approaches tentatively and catches Maki’s saying, “—is based on nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing!?” Kaede shouts back. “Who—who else would have broken into my room <i>and</i> Kokichi’s room? Why are you even trying to deny it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone broke into your room?” Tsumugi asks hesitantly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at her, seemingly almost confused by her presence, before her eyes shift to Tenko and she appears to relax slightly. “I tried to go to my room during the investigation, and the door was practically falling off its hinges. And when I went inside, it was obvious someone had been through my stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you already fucking said nothing was missing!” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t change the fact that someone was in my room!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi quietly slips around them to stand near Ryoma simply watching the argument before him through half-lidded eyes. “You investigated?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, a bit,” she answers. “And they…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He sighs as he tugs at his hat. “Kaede went to her room and got angry when, well, she spelled it out pretty well. Apparently she checked and the same thing was true for Kokichi’s room. ‘Course none of us know what he had in there well enough to know if anything was missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone went through both of their rooms,” Tsumugi says. “And she thinks it was Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Mean, she’s the most likely suspect, but,” his eyes flicker over the argument before them that seems just on the verge of escalating to a screaming match. “Don’t really feel like getting involved in it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—yeah,” she says. “Yeah…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets herself tune back into the others fighting when she hears Kaede say, “You know—it doesn’t matter because as soon as we get down there, you’re going to be executed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “I’m not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scoffs. “Really? You really think we’re not going to vote for you immediately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I just know how Monokuma’s rules work,” Maki says. “Which is why I prepared for them. No matter who you vote for, Monokuma can’t touch me as long as I’m in the Exisal. He’s powerless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks up at the giant robot, it’s shadow casting malevolently over all of them. “I… I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “You’ll have to come out of there eventually.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, just fucking knock it off already,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls before turning away, mumbling to herself, “Why am I even bothering with talking to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">An uneasy silence falls over them. The elevator has yet to arrive, and Tsumugi looks over her remaining classmates, all so wrapped up in their own versions of the truth that she makes a decision.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When the trial starts, she’ll lead them through every twist and turn, whether they like it or not.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">One of my favorite things is arguments where neither character is completely right or completely wrong, so, well, that's what I was trying out my hand at writing here, haha. Anyway, I will have some more real life responsibilities coming up soon, but I still hope to be able to update at a reasonably regular pace!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The wait for the elevator is dead quiet. Fitting the five of them in the cramped space with an Exisal was an obvious impossibility, and Maki simply strode forward ahead of them to take the first ride down alone. Monokuma had appeared to make a general fuss, but Maki had seemed prepared for him and simply replied that he could either do a trial without the class or without the culprit if he refused them a second elevator trip.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the exception of Kaede directing a rather pointed look towards both Kaito and Maki when the latter had so casually announced herself as the culprit, little came of the incident other than the extreme discomfort they now found themselves in now.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede darkly mutters under her breath, “this is ridiculous,” and Tsumugi doesn’t miss the way Kaito rolls his eyes. The two are too locked up in their own anger to make note of anyone besides each other, and Tsumugi steals the occasion glance at either of them in turn to gauge how they’ve managed to continue their hostilities in absolute silence.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma seems undisturbed as he chews on his cigarette and keeps his gaze hooded by his hat forward. Tenko is the only one who Tsumugi guesses shares her levels of discomfort. Her arms are wrapped protectively around herself, she appears to be on the edge of saying something for their entire wait.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But the silence continues until the elevator softly dings. Kaede stomps towards it, mumbling, “let’s get this over with.” Kaito sighs in frustration as he follows her but doesn’t say anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a second to ready himself on his crutches before heading forward of his own accord, either not noticing or not bothering to acknowledge Tsumugi silently trying to catch his attention. With Ryoma as a lost cause, she turns to Tenko, who only bites her lip in response to Tsumugi’s attempt at an encouraging smile. “Are you ready?” Tsumugi says. “We’re… we’re the only ones who investigated, so we’re going to have to try our best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives her a lingering look and seems to internally weigh something before saying, “Yeah, yeah…” Her eyes flicker to the ground before she takes a deep breath and forces herself to smile back. “You can do it, Tsumugi. Tenko… Tenko knows you can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her tone of voice betrays just how little she believes in that, but Tsumugi still says, “Thank you—and I know you can do it, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tenko nods to herself. “Right. Thank you, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods again and walks away from their half-hearted conversation. Tsumugi’s only a stride behind her, and makes her way easily enough to her usual spot at the back of the elevator. With their backs turned to her, Tsumugi observes them coolly again, thinking idly over how awry things have gone, how she can possibly pick up the pieces before her, how whatever awaits them after this trial will possibly play out.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The doors click shut and the hum narrating their descent is a saving grace as the others all remain too wrapped up in their worlds to say anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal is waiting almost nonchalantly in the trial room when they arrive. It’s positioned roughly behind where Maki’s usual trial stand is, but Ryoma seems remarkably cavalier about the situation with little attention paid to it other than a mumbled, “huh,” as he moves to his place right next to the towering machine.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi moves to take her stand, and the only other reaction to the courtroom she notices is Tenko flinching slightly at finally being framed by the familiar crossed out portraits. Tsumugi does think the red X slashed over Kokichi’s mouth is perhaps a bit much, but another part of her almost vindictively thinks how appropriate it is. <i>No more lies.</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, now that everyone is <i>finally</i> assembled,” Monokuma says with an agitated look towards Maki’s Exisal. “I suppose we can begin. So, to start with a basic explanation of the class trial—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t need it,” Kaede says. “We don’t need to do any of this. Monokuma, just let us vote already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh? Voting already? But we just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” Maki says. “And after we do, Monokuma will realize it’s impossible to keep playing his game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Impossib—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede throws her hands in the air. “Okay, I don’t know what the hell I’m expecting, but can you care for five seconds that someone is dead because of you? You killed an innocent person and you’re completely unrepentant—why is no one bothered by this!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, shut the hell up,” Kaito snaps. “And stop fucking pretending you’re the only person who cares about Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “Ignore her—Kaede has already proven she has no problem hiding behind corpses.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m hiding?” Kaede scoffs. “I’m not the one in a giant <i>fucking</i> robot!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you believe it would be better if I were to leave the Exisal,” Maki says. “I suppose Kaito was right—you really do want me to be executed. Although, you wanted that before Kokichi’s death, so that would mean you’re just hiding behind him, too, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grits her teeth, and her hands turn white from the strain of gripping the front of her podium. “I want justice for my friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “You want to continue the killing game—which I suppose makes sense given that you started it… and your real identity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede throws her hands in the air. “I am not a Remnant of Despair! Whatever you saw in that Flashback Light was a trick!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses for a moment. Then, “I think you should tell that to Shuichi. And maybe Rantaro, too. Actually…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She trails off, leaving Kaede to shout back, “So I killed them, alright! But that doesn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That you’re the mastermind?” Rantaro says from the Exisal. “Those two things don’t go together somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sudden appearance of a voice they thought they would never hear again spurs the others to interrupt, even if solely out of sheer confusion. “Wha…” Kaito begins. “What the hell is going on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Rantaro?” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth but is interrupted by Shuichi’s voice. “I suppose you would appreciate this more, but I think going over how much you love him would just be a waste of time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives Kaede something close to a sympathetic look as she trembles in anger in the face of the Exisal. “Hey, Maki,” he says. “Yeah, just—knock that off already. There’s… no fucking point to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her own voice comes through the speakers again as she says, “I was planning to. The Exisal for some reason has the ability to mimic any of our voices. I was intending to use it if Kaede became too much of a nuisance, and that happened earlier than I expected, it seems.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah…” Kaito says, furrowing his brow as he stares at the ground.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s eyes slide over to him as he casually remarks, “you don’t have to agree with her on everything just because you don’t want her killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito jerks up to look at him. “I fucking know that. I just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Cruelty’s cruelty,” Ryoma says with a shrug. “All I’m saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks,” she says, “that we shouldn’t talk about this anymore. And that Maki shouldn’t use the voice changer anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I second that,” Tsumugi chimes in. “Like Ryoma said—it’s just plainly cruel… even if Kaede is the mastermind, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They all seem to wait for a moment for a defense from her, but Kaede remains silent, eyes still locked on Maki’s Exisal. Ryoma lets out a sigh. “So we’re voting now, then. We’re all in agreement to just get this over?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says, with a shake of his head. “We’re not killing Maki—Ryoma, I thought you said you didn’t want to play Monokuma’s game anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” he says. “But it seems like Maki’s already figured out what she wants to do.” He pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and says with a shrug, “And I think skipping the part where everyone yells at each other would be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito opens his mouth to protest again when Maki cuts him off. “Kaito—it’s fine. Whether we vote now or later, Monokuma cannot do anything to me. As long as you survive this, I do not care how this trial goes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He blinks at her words, saying only, “Maki…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi bites her lip, unsure how to urge further discussion when Tenko does it for her. “Um,” she says. “Tenko is… sorry for bringing this up, but Maki? You want Kaito to survive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki, to her credit seems unphased, “Is there a problem with that? You of all people have been very insistent upon wanting people to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has,” she says. “But just,” she shakes her head. “Tenko… Tenko knows that Maki isn’t the only possible killer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede gasps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Maki says. “What are you trying to accuse me of?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Lying, is my guess,” Ryoma says dully.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head but keeps her voice calm as she says, “Tenko, I know you’re just trying to help, but there’s no doubt that Maki’s the killer. I saw her and, even if he’s being awful right now, Kaito did, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets under their barrage and seems on the verge of dropping it altogether as they continue. Tsumugi pushes her glasses up, partially hoping they’ll shine in such a way to make her seem more like a protagonist.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko just thinks,” she says. “That there might be more possible killers than just Maki…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have no intentions of defending myself,” Maki says. “Or hiding from my crime. Why are you trying to make excuses for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think we should vote for Maki,” Kaito says. “Or anyone, but trying to find another killer? Isn’t it impossible for anyone else to be the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns in spite of her words. “It is. As much as I hate to agree, Kaito’s right. Maki’s the killer—there’re eyewitnesses, evidence, and she confessed. There’s just no debating that point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, right,” Tenko says. “Sorry, Tenko just… wasn’t sure. Tenko doesn’t want to accuse any of her friends either, so… she probably just got confused.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if this nonsense is over,” Maki says. “Then we can end this farce of a trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Monokuma,” Kaede says. “Just let us vote already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi can barely stop the eagerness in her voice as she says, “No, that’s wrong! There is another possible culprit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks more confused than anything as she says, “Who?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito…” Tenko says very softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares at her in shock for a moment, recovering himself only to say, “Tenko? You think I—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t want to!” she shouts back. “Tenko doesn’t want to think that <i>anyone</i> would torture and kill one of her friends, but—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko cuts herself off with a shake of her head. “Tortured,” Ryoma says, echoing her last sentiment. “Never went to the hanger but… Tenko wouldn’t lie about that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems somehow even angrier than before. “You—you think the fact that he was tortured means I fucking killed him!? Who the hell do you think—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not why,” Tsumugi says, the sudden strictness in her normally soft voice commanding their attention. “Tenko was certainly very upset by the state of the hanger, but that’s not why Kaito is a possible culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And…” Kaede says hesitantly. “Why does Tenko think that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because of what Maki was saying,” Tsumugi says. “About how she only wants Kaito to live. Doesn’t that plainly seem strange? I mean, what kind of culprit shows up to their trial and then hurries the vote against them? Mystery isn’t my favorite genre, but I’ve played enough games to know the first culprit is always a red herring!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “So you have no logical argument. My goals of ending this game and keeping Kaito alive are important, but I have no intentions of dying for them. And I also have no intention of behaving like Kaede and killing innocent people for the sake of a schoolyard crush, if that’s what you’re implying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares down the hulking robot. “No, you’d just kill innocent people for fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says. “Can you fucking sto—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s also another reason!” Tsumugi says hurriedly. “A-Another reason why Kaito could be the killer. Or at least, um, a reason that lets things sort of all make sense together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s gaze shifts to her, and he seems more tired than anything as he says, “I didn’t kill Kokichi. I… I fucking learned my lesson, and I swore I would protect him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows that,” Tenko says. “But… Kaito still had the opportunity to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t know much about that,” Ryoma says. “But,” he sighs. “There’s motive, too. Stop Maki from becoming the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t fucking do that!” Kaito yells. He’s clenching his jaw, and as hot headed as he’s always been, Tsumugi thinks this might be the angriest she’s ever seen him. “All of you—how the hell can all of you think I would do that to him!? I know I fucked up before, but Kokichi was my friend!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is a brief moment of silence as his words echo in the room, and Tsumugi sees him bracing himself on his podium, sweat beading on his forehead. Her first thought is that his current posture and heavy breathing might be from sheer emotional exertion, but then she notices that his other hand is pressed to his stomach.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She isn’t sure if Maki notices as well, but the other girl says, “Accusing Kaito is a waste of time, and if you attempt to vote for him, I will stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nonchalantly stares up at the guns looming over his head. “Not sure if more murder’s allowed at a class trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d like to see Monokuma stop me,” Maki responds. “But either way, it doesn’t matter. Kaito’s innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you just threatened to shoot us all as a ‘just in case,’” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns, then, doing her best not to shrink in on herself when everyone’s gazes turn to her. “Um, everyone, I understand wanting to believe Kaito’s word but… that’s not actually proof that he’s innocent, is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand over his face. “For fuck’s sake, Tsumugi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko says. “Do not swear at her—Tsumugi is simply trying to find the truth because…” her gaze falls to the ground. “Because we still don’t know what happened when you went to the hanger alone last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He seems to freeze in place at that, and Maki answers instead. “Kaito doesn’t have to say anything to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls as she crosses her arms. “So you’re going to hide information from—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you want to know what happened when he came to the hanger, I can tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi furrows her brow. “Ah, I guess that would work, but I plainly think Kaito can tell us himself. I mean, the suspect should be the one to give their alibi, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s hands are curled around the edge of his podium, and his mouth remains glued shut as he tears his eyes away from her without a word. It’s suspicious enough of a reaction that Maki once again leaps to his defense. “Kaito’s not responding because he’s ashamed,” she says. “I didn’t let him into the hanger last night, and that was the end of it. Now, do we really need to waste more time on this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Can’t believe I’m saying this,” he says. “But this is too suspicious to just ignore… we should keep going with the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I plainly have to agree,” Tsumugi says with a short nod. “There’s nothing wrong with wanting to protect one of your friends, but in a class trial, we can’t just trust in friendshi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki’s telling the truth,” Kaito says suddenly. “My plan to try and save Kokichi was a complete failure—I never even made it past the fucking barrier before she stopped me and I just…” his expression is distant and there’s something almost broken in it as he continues. “Gave up… and then I went back and left Kokichi to die without even seeing him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets, though seems oddly relieved by such a depressing answer. “So Kaito was simply being quiet because he was sad he wasn’t able to save Kokichi.” She smiles softly at him. “And he’s too much of an awful, prideful boy to say anything—that’s the only thing he is guilty of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t respond other than to give her a rather self-deprecating, pained smile. He seems to be on the verge of saying something further to agree with her, when Kaede says, “Is that why you didn’t come back to Shuichi’s lab that night? Were you just… too ashamed of yourself?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not accusatory, and Kaito’s eyes rake over her for a moment before saying, “Yeah. I…” he runs a hand through his hair. “I knew I couldn’t face you—I couldn’t fucking face anyone after breaking my promise and running away like a coward.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you,” Ryoma says, still intently fiddling with his cigarette. “You just went back to your room? That’s your entire story.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not a story—it’s the truth,” Maki says. “And now that you’ve forced Kaito to say it himself, are you satisfied?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares at his cigarette and seems mildly frustrated even as he responds, “if the others are… I am. Won’t drag things out on just a feeling.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at his words. “A feeling?” she says. “What kind of feeling?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Not worth explaining.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede also appears to be having a hard time swallowing his odd dismissal, and furrows her brow even as she says, “So… we’re done here then. Kaito had nothing to do with what happened and this has just been a wild goose chase.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The right answer,” Maki says. “Is usually the most obvious. The facts of this case were known from the very beginning, and, like I keep saying, arguing is a waste of time. Going over them to the point of nausea isn’t going to change anything, nor will it bring Kokichi back from the dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why,” Ryoma says. “We should drop me getting a vague feeling about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns, running everyone’s words through her head. Something is… not right, she decides even as she realizes that insisting that on only a hunch isn’t about to earn any support. But the trial must continue. She steels herself to speak again. “I-I also have a weird feeling about this,” she says. “And I think if two of us feel that way, it’s worth talking about, even if only for a little while longer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others look unconvinced, and Ryoma sighs. “I regret mentioning anything—don’t have a feeling or a hunch about anything.” He pulls down his hat. “So we can just get this over with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-It’s not just a feeling!” Tsumugi insists. “It’s—it’s intuition! A-And not only that, but I also investigated and I’m sure if we just talk about the crime scene a bit more, I can figure out why I just plainly feel so weird about all this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs, and Tsumugi is sure if she could see her, she should would be on the receiving end of a rather impressive eye roll. “Tsumugi, is there a reason you insist on dragging out every little detail of this, or are you really just that paranoid?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My life is on the line!” Tsumugi says. “All of our lives are on the line right now, a-and,” her eyes dart around the room, looking for support. “And I know everyone is tired, but it really can’t hurt to make sure that we’re being thorough about things. And maybe being exhausted or accusing each other of horrible things… that is terrible, I know, but it’s better than being dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Tenko says giving her an odd but somehow still sympathetic look. “You… you really want to live—Tenko means, Tenko doesn’t want to die either, but after everything we heard about the outside world, you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t finish her thought, but Tsumugi still answers it with a slightly embarrassed nod of her head. “I do. And—and maybe there is nothing left for us, but I still don’t want to give up. I still want to hold on to hope, no matter what it takes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Hope?’” Kaede echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And because of that,” she swallows as her eyes stray towards Kaito still clenching his jaw. “I’m sorry, Kaito, but I’m going to suspect you until my doubts are cleared because… I really just plainly don’t want to risk getting it wrong. I don’t want to risk things ending in despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito seems unmoved by her speech, crossing his arms and glaring at the ground. He works his jaw a few times before finally saying, “I know we’re supposed to be symbols of hope and all of that crap, but… but if hope is what’s making you think that I would ever kill one of my friends—that I would kill someone I swore to protect—then I want nothing to do with that shitty hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi feels her lips pull into a slight frown. “I’m sorry you feel that way, Kaito,” she says after a moment. “And I do want to believe in you, but I need to clear my doubts first, if that’s alright. And I just… don’t believe in belief without doubts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He continues to glare at the floor. Maki says, “Just let her tire herself out—as soon as Tsumugi sees there’s nothing here, she’ll give up and we can move on with our lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Not gonna tell anyone they should just give up living so,” he shakes his head. “You do what you need to do, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” she fills her confidence falter for a second even as she regains control. “I will. Um, thank you, everyone. I promise I will do my best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then stop stalling and actually present your arguments,” Maki snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“R-Right!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I understand why you’re doing this,” Kaede begins. “But… I don’t think I can believe Kaito would hurt Kokichi without evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And when Tsumugi realizes there is none,” Maki says. “She’ll give up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Evidence that Kaito is the culprit…” Tenko says. “If there was any, Tenko thinks it would be in the hanger…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe just evidence that he’s lying,” Ryoma says. “Sometimes people who aren’t the killer lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito already gave his testimony,” Maki says. “You asked for the truth, and he gave it to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says, furrowing her brow. “Do you think Kaito is lying about his testimony? Is that why you have a weird feeling?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma adds very quietly, “She’s not the only one with a weird feeling about what he said…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko says. “Please say something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He doesn’t have to tell you anything,” Maki responds instead.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “I think you’re right—I think what’s bothering me is that Kaito’s testimony doesn’t match up with what we found at the crime scene.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t lie!” Kaito shouts suddenly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do not yell at her!” Tenko shouts back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “You hear what she’s saying—she’s fucking accusing me of killing Kokichi, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if you didn’t,” Tenko says raising her voice. “If… If Kaito is innocent, then you should have no problems with hearing the rest of what Tsumugi has to say. Because,” her voice cracks slightly. “Because Tenko knows you are innocent, so you should not be afraid… you should not be yelling at people to shut up and then get quiet when they try to ask you a question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods along eagerly with Tenko’s defense. “Tenko is right, and I’m sure this is all a misunderstanding and that there’s a perfectly good reason for why… for why you lied about not getting past the barrier last night when you went to go bring the antidote to Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gapes at her, but before he can say anything, Kaede says, “You got into the hanger last night?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where is your evidence?” Maki says. “You can’t just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night,” Tsumugi says. “Kaito went to get an electrohammer from Ryoma, and, Ryoma, did he ever bring it back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “That was the last time I… saw him that night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then Kaito simply took it with him when he returned to his room,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, he didn’t,” Tenko says softly. “This morning… Tenko and Tsumugi found two used electrohammers inside of the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs at the brim of her hat. “One of them was probably the one Maki used last night, but if there was another used one…” She shakes her head. “Kokichi had extras in the hanger, so the second one was probably just one Maki used for something last night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “Okay, but what did you use it on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “I had to enter and exit the hanger during the night to get cleaning supplies. The hammers were just the most convenient way to take down the barrier since I wasn’t about to devote time to remembering Monokuma’s ridiculous code.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That,” Kaede says. “That doesn’t make sense—you had Kokichi with you, and he had the remote to the hanger. Are you saying you just let him keep it while you were torturing him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did not torture the little pest,” she says. “I only found the hammers to be easier—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But then,” Tsumugi interrupts. “Why wasn’t there a used hammer outside of the hanger when we went there this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says suddenly. “Just… stop. They’re not buying it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives him a sidelong glance. “You’re confessing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kaito clutches the edges of his podium despite long since having held on to it a white knuckled grip. He seems to debate something for a moment longer before letting out a sigh. “Yeah, I got into the hanger last night. I talked to Maki, dropped the hammer I used like a fucking idiot, and… and I saw Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His statement is enough to make even Maki in the Exisal start at his words. “Kaito—what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito ignores her. “I told her I was there to give Kokichi the antidote, and she told me to leave, and when I said I wasn’t gonna do that, we got into another fight and the antidote shattered on the floor.” He squeezes his eyes shut. “When that happened, I knew Kokichi was going to die from Maki’s poison, and—and, fuck, I had to do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” Kaede says very quietly. “What was that something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, shut up,” Maki snaps. “Stop lying, stop—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was telling the truth earlier when I said I would never do anything to hurt Kokichi,” he says. “But,” he presses the heel of his hand to his eyes. “I couldn’t just let him suffer, and I couldn’t let Maki be executed. You were right, Tsumugi, I was hiding crap, but you guys figured it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito is lying,” Maki says. “He thinks he is trying to protect me, even though all that will do will result in everyone dying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls down his hat. “Well, this all certainly seems familiar.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lips as her gaze strays to the ground. Tenko speaks instead, saying, “do you think… Monokuma will let us be wrong again? Or will we all die for real this time…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not going to come to that,” Tsumugi says. “I-I want to live, and I refuse to let it come to that again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I also refuse to allow a split vote,” Maki says. “Kaito, I’m not running away, so stop trying to help me. Now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Kaito is the culprit,” Kaede says. “And everything up till now was a trap to get us to vote for Maki, she would still be safe from Monokuma’s punishment. The two of them could claim to be the two remaining students in the rules and escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would never do that!” Kaito shouts. “I’d never just fucking leave you guys to die—that’s why I’m confessing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You also said you would never hurt Kokichi!” Kaede yells back at him. “You keep going on, and on, lying and lying. And maybe you’re telling the truth now, or maybe you were telling it earlier, but either way that means that at some point during this trial, you were—or maybe still are—willing to let everyone die!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I killed Kokichi! Is that what you want to hear!? I couldn’t get the antidote to him, so I killed him!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands as Kaede screams back at him. The fact that they had survived Shuichi’s trial after voting incorrectly had been a fluke, and Tsumugi knows that there is no possibility of Monokuma sparing them a second time.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her eyes dart to the Exisal as Maki inputs her own scattered defenses of Kaito into the shouting match happening in the court room. This is different than Shuichi’s trial. There is a right answer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “E-Excuse me! I think there is a way to find out who’s lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “What are you talking about? Me and Maki are the only ones who—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I mean,” she says. “It’s sorta like what we tried before with,” her eyes dart briefly to Kaede, “with Shuichi’s trial. Both suspects can tell us how they, um, how they did it and we can compare using the evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Ryoma says. “That failed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tsumugi concedes. “But I investigated the crime scene really thoroughly this time. Tenko, did, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s lips twitch into a frown before she opens her mouth, but Tenko interjects, “Tenko doesn’t know how helpful she’ll be, but,” she bites her lip. “She doesn’t think she can believe any of her friends would do something so horrible without proof. So… so Tenko isn’t going to vote until she’s convinced.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede breathes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are you acting shocked?” Maki says. “Isn’t that how we’re supposed to vote at every class trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It is,” Tsumugi says before Kaede can argue back. “And that’s why I really want to hear the full, true story from both of you before we proceed any further.” The authoritativeness in her voice suddenly makes her feel self conscious as the others turn to her, and Tsumugi quickly adds. “I-If that’s plainly alright with everyone, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “I have no problems with—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi, what kind of game are you playing?” Kaito asks. “First you do all this crap to make me confess to being the culprit, and now you don’t fucking believe me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She blinks at him. “I, um, w-well—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got what you fucking wanted,” he says. “I killed Kokichi, and I lied because I didn’t want to admit that I hurt one of my friends. And now that you know, we can just vote and end this fucked up trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi fidgets under his intense stare. But still, she presses on, saying, “I’m sorry I accused you earlier, Kaito, but… please stop lying to me. All I want to know is the truth, and if you were actually Kokichi’s friend, you wouldn’t be trying so hard to stop me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito practically growls at her. “Shut up! Stop fucking acting like you know anything about me or about Kokichi, or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will know if you tell me what happened,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi does her best to steel herself in the wake of the look of pure rage on his face as he glares at her. Sometimes, she knows, that someone will refuse to listen and the only way to get through to them is one-on-one.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t want him to die from the poison, so I just… made sure he didn’t suffer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki freaked out and said she’d take care of it so there wouldn’t be a trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So she crushed his body and pretended that she was the killer when that wasn’t enough.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “How many times do you want me to tell you how badly I fucked up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No,” she says. “It’s not that, it’s just that from the way you told your story, it sounds like the bottle for the antidote would be right near the entrance, right? But when Tenko and I went to the hanger—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it wasn’t exactly at the entrance,” Kaito says. “The point is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Objection! You’re changing your story!” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “No, I’m not—we fought and the fucking bottle broke. That’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, and if you didn’t fight right at the entrance, then can you tell me where exactly in the hanger this happened?” she says. “And if you were so desperate to give Kokichi the antidote, why did you wait until you were somewhere else in the hanger to bring up giving it to him with Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses, and begins his explanation with a stammer that gives Tsumugi an odd sense of satisfaction. His eyes dart away from her, looking so much like a caged animal as he begins to speak. “L-Look, okay—it just—it doesn’t matter. I told you the tru—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you did,” Tsumugi says. “Then you can tell me where the antidote was in the hanger this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” he says. “I don’t fucking know—I wasn’t paying attention to that. And Maki probably moved—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If she did, then that would mean she individually moved all of the glass and the puddle it made on the ground.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stops again, running a hand through his hair and cursing to himself. Maki steps in saying, “You made your point, Tsumugi. Kaito,” her voice turns softer. “You can stop now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks up at her for a brief moment before sighing and hanging his head. Tenko hesitatingly says, “so all of that—that was just made up. Kaito didn’t hurt Kokichi.” She smiles softly. “Tenko is actually relieved to hear that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He didn’t hurt Kokichi,” Kaede says. “But… Kaito, you just tried to kill all of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito remains silent, and Maki speaks again. “You act like no one here has ever done that before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs as he tugs at his hat. Kaede keeps frowning, clearly unsatisfied with that answer. “Just because someone else has doesn’t mean it’s okay,” she says. “Our lives are at stake, and I’m just pointing out that this isn’t the first time Kaito has tried to kill us for Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tenko asks quietly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean that he tried to convince us to just let the time limit expire, so we’d all die instead of just Maki,” Kaede says. “We just,” she pulls her hat down. “For this trial, we can’t trust him. It’s too likely that he’s just going to lie again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think I have to agree with that,” Tsumugi says. “Um, sorry, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki scoffs. “You seemed so excited to back him into a corner, and you’re apologizing now? If you don’t trust him, just say it. I think we’re all far past pretending to get along at this point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito mumbles to himself just on the edge of Tsumugi’s hearing, “I didn’t want to hurt anyone… fuck…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her much better hearing, Kaede seems to miss his comment as she glares up at Maki. “You know, I think we figured that out when you decided to go on a killing spree.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One person is not a spree,” Maki says. “And it’s a bit hard to take that accusation seriously, coming from you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get it,” Kaede hisses. “I killed Rantaro and Sai—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are responsible for the deaths of everyone in the killing game,” Maki says. “Or, should I say, your killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Kaede can respond, Tsumugi says, “Ah, right—no matter what happens, it would be… probably really dangerous to forget about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts uncomfortably from foot to foot. “Tenko doesn’t know about tha—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not the mastermind!” Kaede shouts. “I already told you guys—you were tricked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tricked how?” Kaito says bitterly, eyes still locked on the floor. “It was in a fucking Flashback Light. There can be no mistake about what you really are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Suppose that is true,” Ryoma says before shifting slightly to lean more comfortably on his crutch. “Since we’re at a trial, guess now’s not the worst time for an interrogation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good point,” Maki says. “Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have nothing to say to you,” Kaede bites back. “And—and if I’m a Remnant of Despair or whatever, then what the hell are you? Are you really trying to argue that you’re somehow more innocent than I am? You’re a cold blooded killer—even now, after you’ve made,” she throws her hands in the air, “the one person you care about here miserable, you still don’t care that you’re killing and hurting people. How can whatever the hell I am be worse than that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A brief silence casts over the room before Tsumugi clears her throat with an artificial cough. “Ah, um, I know I’m pretty plainly not the person you want to hear an answer to that from, but, well, while I know everyone made their own choices to kill or not, none of us would even be in this mess if it weren’t for the Remnants of Despair and the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” Ryoma says, eyes pointedly not on Kaede, “can’t speak for her, but we’re symbols of hope or something. Maki probably went after you to try and stop humanity’s last survivors from falling into despair. Also,” his gaze finally flickers up to her. “Kaede, even if you’re not the mastermind, you’re probably not the person who should be upset about someone committing murder to try and end the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think I’m the exact right person because I know just how unforgivable it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi isn’t quite sure how to respond to that, and it appears that no one else is, either, as another silence falls over them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, “Um, if it’s alright, Tenko has a question for Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at Tenko as Maki says, “I thought we agreed to question Kaede now. I think everyone would prefer to get some information out of the mastermind about their idiotic game while we have the opportunity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “That’s… sort of related to Tenko’s question. Kinda.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, if you have something to say, just spit it out,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns at that, seeming to gain some of her resolve back through sheer agitation. “Tenko is happy that Kaede is okay,” she begins. “But she doesn’t understand why… why Kokichi is the victim, not Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito blinks at her. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko wasn’t there for the Flashback Light,” she says. “But it said that Kaede was a Remnant of Despair and that Kokichi, um, was he also one or was he a student like us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t remember anything special about him,” Ryoma says. “We were all in different classes, so none of us had met each other before this, including Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “That’s right, so I guess we can just assume he was a student. I feel like if I remembered Kaede being a Remnant of Despair, I would have remembered if Kokichi was one, too. Why do you ask?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tenko says. “It’s just… Maki went after Kaede because she was the mastermind, right? Or a Remnant of Despair at least…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there a point here?” Maki says. “Or are you just going to repeat information we already know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Tenko says. “You told Tenko that your mission is to kill the mastermind, and that the way you solve your problems is to complete your mission so why… why did you kill Kokichi instead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was in the way,” she replies nonchalantly. “Just because my goal was—and still is—to kill Kaede, doesn’t mean I would spare everyone who tried to stop me. And I said before that I would kill him, so I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says quietly. “You—you promised me… Did you really hate him that much?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses for a moment before saying, “I am sorry, Kaito. Not for what I did but for betraying your faith. I’m not as a good a person as you want me to be, and I never have been.” She goes quiet again, and her voice sounds almost pained when she next speaks. “I am sorry you had to find out this way… still, thank you for having believed in me. I’ve never had that before, and it was nice while it lasted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How real is this apology?” Kaede cuts in.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s gaze snaps to her. “Akama—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only thing you just said is that you’re sad killing whoever you want makes Kaito upset,” Kaede says. “And you basically admitted that you killed Kokichi just because you could, not to mention you obviously have no intentions to change since you also said you’re still planning to kill me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, wait,” Tsumugi says. Kaito, Kaede, and the hulking Exisal all shift to stare at her, and she shrinks slightly under their shared gazes as she continues. “U-Um, I was just thinking that’s strange, isn’t it? If Maki killed Kokichi for no reason why, well, why didn’t she just shoot him? She has a crossbow, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did kill him with the crossbow,” Maki says. “And then I crushed the body to prevent a trial. Haven’t we already discussed this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… doesn’t remember,” she says cautiously. “But Kokichi’s specific cause of death isn’t listed in the Monokuma File because of—of what happened to his body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Well, now you know, though it doesn’t really matter. Whether, he was poisoned, shot, or crushed—dead is dead, and that’s the end of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You sound real apologetic,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t need the mastermind talking back to me,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sorry,” Tsumugi says. “Er, sorry to interrupt again, but doesn’t that plainly seem kind of like a strange answer? ‘His cause of death doesn’t matter?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the truth,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t believe that,” Tenko says. “Because—because Tenko wanted to know even before the trial why one of her friends had to die. And Maki said—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was collateral,” Maki says. “What more reason do you want?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “I think I have to agree with Tsumugi now. You like showing off how good you are at killing, so tell us how you did it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs again. “Like I said—it doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then it won’t hurt to tell us,” Ryoma reasons.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says after a brief moment of silence. “I suppose it won’t. I merely wanted to avoid the details for Kaito’s sake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stays quiet but noticeably grimaces as he grabs at his side. Kaede says, “I’m sure he can stomach it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses again. Then, “Fine then. But I’ll only say this once, so if you’re not paying attention, it’s your own fault.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know why you’re all so obsessed with this,” Maki says. “But I killed Kokichi exactly how you think I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What is that supposed to mean?” Kaede says. “Did you shoot him or let him die slowly from the poison?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone said the scene of the crime,” Ryoma says, “made it seem like he was tortured before he died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Poison would make more sense then,” Kaede says. “If Maki wanted to torture him because apparently that’s fun for her, she probably just let the poison kill him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “Suppose that makes sense. Is there any proof another arrow was used? Or any other weapons?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe if there was another arrow,” Tenko says. “It was crushed with him in the hydraulic press, but that means we have no idea…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito squeezes his eyes shut, though remains silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you don’t need to know, either,” Maki says. “Like I said, the specifics change nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The cause of death isn’t listed in the Monokuma File,” Kaede says. “Which means it has to be important somehow, right? And it’s definitely something you don’t want us to know, which means we can’t let it go if we want the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, I agree with that!” Tsumugi says a bit too loudly in her excitement. “What we should think about is what was at the crime scene, because there was a weapon there that seemed out of place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “What do you mean? Was it the arrows or the poison that seemed wrong to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What seems wrong is that there was one more weapon there,” Tsumugi says. “Even though Kokichi was shot and poisoned, I think it’s much more likely that he died from something else, given the scene of the crime.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that third mystery weapon is?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, you see when I was investigating, hidden in the bathroom was a—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A knife,” Maki cuts her off. “I ended up finishing Kokichi off with a knife I had brought with me. Satisfied?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi can’t help but let her shoulders slump at the loss of her dramatic reveal. “Oh,” she says. “Um, yes. That’s what I thought.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then why did you hide it?” Kaede says. “Why is it so important to you to lie to us about stupid things?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already told you,” Maki answers. “Given the circumstances, I would prefer to spare the details. I don’t want to make anyone here suffer more than necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you made Kokichi suffer,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks… you used the knife to torture him, but you don’t want us to know because you don’t want to hurt Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi died really horribly, didn’t he?” Tenko continues. “But you still care more about making sure Kaito isn’t uncomfortable…” she shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t understand, and she doesn’t think she wants to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki goes perfectly quiet for a moment. Then, “I’m not going to try to convince you to feel differently. What’s done is done, and I still do not regret it. I suppose now, though, you will feel less guilty in voting for me, so maybe this conversation wasn’t so useless after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So everything you’ve done in this trial,” Ryoma says, eyeing the Exisal dubiously. “Was all of it for Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She probably targeted Kokichi because of that, too,” Kaede adds. “Maki, is that the real reason you killed him? Are you <i>that</i> obsessed with Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito winces slightly at the conversation, but only moves to clutch at his side as leans more of his weight against his podium.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, it seems like it,” Tsumugi says. “Ugh, that’s kind of a bummer—I’m really not a fan of that trope. It always just feels kinda lazy and bad to me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did it to end the game,” Maki says. “But if that’s easier for you to accept, then fine, I did it all for him. I’m sick of talking about this. Monokuma, I believe we’re ready to vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Wait!” Tsumugi calls out. “Isn’t it too early for that? There are still some mysteries that still plainly haven’t been answered.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi, for fuck’s sake,” Kaito says finally. “God, it almost seems like you’re fucking enjoying this or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No, of course I’m not!” she says. “I just want to know—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why Kokichi died,” Kaito says. “I get it. I fucking heard you the first time. But just,” he presses a hand to his face. “I wanna know why shit happened the way it did, too, sure, but going over how brutally he was killed, how much pain he was in, how everyone fucking failed him over and over again. I’m just,” he sighs. “I’m done. I don’t even care who you guys vote for anymore. Just put us out of our fucking misery already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, softer, “I did mean it when I apologized, Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” he says, matching her volume before going silent again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks around almost desperately at the others, hoping someone will speak up in agreement with her. When no one does and Maki again prompts Monokuma, saying, “What are you waiting for?” she finds herself struggling in the spotlight again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We, um, we don’t need to talk about Kokichi anymore if it’s too hard,” Tsumugi says. “But maybe we could talk a little bit more about Kaede? I mean, if she is the mastermind, then couldn’t we end this entire game right now and no one else would have to be executed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s a fair enough point,” Maki says. “One I tried to argue for earlier, so fine. Kaede—were you working alone when you trapped us in this game, or was Kokichi also working for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “If he didn’t confess after you did whatever kind of horrible stuff they teach you in assassin school to him, then I think you should conclude that no, he had nothing to do with anything, and you butchered an innocent person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede also wouldn’t know if Kokichi was working for the mastermind or not anyway,” Tenko says. “Since she is also innocent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The misplaced belief you have based on your feeling isn’t evidence,” Maki says. “We all know what the Flashback Light showed us, and all the good feelings and trust in the word isn’t going to change that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “I’m afraid that’s right. The power of friendship is really nice and uplifting, but… it’s kind of hard to argue with facts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede groans. “I am not the mastermind! I don’t know anything about Monokuma or why we’re here or what’s outside—if you ask me anything, the answer is going to be ‘I don’t know because I’m not the mastermind!’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says with a sigh. “Just… is there anything you can give us as proof that you’re not? Doesn’t matter how small it is—just anything that shows we can believe you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know if that’s fair to ask,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How so?” he asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko just means that if you asked her to prove she wasn’t the mastermind, she wouldn’t know what to say, and Tenko doesn’t think anyone else can say differently,” she says. “And even if it’s not evidence, Tenko still believes in Kaede—Tenko really wants to believe in the friends she has left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma tugs at his hat. “I… I get that. One of us is still lying, though, even if it’s not Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think we should investigate everyone later,” Tsumugi says. “But right now there’s the most evidence against Kaede that’d it plainly be kind of dangerous to just ignore it—a-at least that’s what I think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “I don’t know what you want me to say. Literally everything I’ve done up until has been to try and make sure you guys survive. I’ve investigated every death and found every culprit and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And doesn’t that seem like something the mastermind would do?” Maki says. “Their game would come to a rather abrupt end if we didn’t pinpoint the culprit. It actually all fits together doesn’t it? The person who does so much at a trial never being targeted, while also getting everyone to see them as a savior so they’re above suspicion, or maybe they just have a god complex and this whole game is just built around making them look good.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If that last point is true,” Tsumugi says. “Then I think it’s safe to say Kaede’s done a pretty bad job if she is the mastermind, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’m not,” Kaede says again. “Why would I go to so much trouble to make my own life miserable? And just think about it! Why would I out myself using the Flashback Light if I was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Been wondering that myself. But Remnants of Despair have… a thing for making their own plans fall apart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what that means,” Kaede says. “And the fact that I have no idea what you’re talking about means I’m being framed!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says suddenly. “Just—just stop yelling at us and give us your damn proof already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him. She opens and closes her mouth a few times before straightening the brim of her cap and saying, “Fine. Fine then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says perking up. “You have proof?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” she says. “And I’d have more if my witness wasn’t dead, but,” she sends a pointed glare towards Maki, “there’s nothing I can do about that now, is there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “So start talking, mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi adjusts her glasses as she focuses in on the conversation, steadying herself so her eagerness to solve the situation before her doesn’t show in her movements.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do have proof that I’m not the mastermind,” Kaede says. “Proof that applies only to me and Kokichi. Everyone besides the two of us is a suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How convenient,” Maki says. “If you want to tell the truth about the two of you working together the hurry up and do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kokichi was not in the Flashback Light like Kaede was,” Tenko says. “So he was just a normal student.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says quietly, “Kokichi’s not the mastermind…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know for a fact that Kokichi is innocent,” Kaede says. “And he also knew that I was, too. Because during the blackout when Himiko was killed, we were the only two with alibis.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu also had an alibi,” Ryoma says. “But… she’s gone, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yes,” Kaede says, losing a touch of her confidence. “That’s true, too, but it still holds up as evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop trying to hide behind Kokichi,” Maki says. “He’s dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And whose fault is that!?” Kaede shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, Kaede!” Tsumugi says. “Your alibi—your alibi is Kokichi’s word?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls. “It’s not just his word, but the fact that he handcuffed himself to me. Neither of us could have done anything to Himiko or anyone else without the other knowing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why the two of you collaborated to continue your game,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you just shut up!?” Kaede yells at her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes dart nervously back and forth between the two of them as she stammers, “U-Uh, well, I’m sorry, Kaede, but was anyone else with you and Kokichi the whole time during the black out to confirm you guys were together? It’s just… it’s hard to take a testimony from someone who isn’t even here as evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns back to her. “Tenko saw it happen, and then we ran into you and Ryoma later, and,” she frowns. “And then we were alone for a while before we ran into Angie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who is also dead,” Maki says. “And you can make up whatever stories you want for corpses to tell, can’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s true!” Kaede says. “And everyone else was alone for the black out, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you don’t have any more evidence,” Ryoma says. “Tenko was right earlier—it’s not like I have something prepared to clear myself, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head, unsure how to end his thought when Maki picks it up for him. “But you have nothing to defend yourself with.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede presses her hands her face in frustration, but doesn’t say anything more other than, “This is a trap—why will none of you listen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “So,” he says. “Kaede’s the mastermind and—and Maki killed Kokichi. Tsumugi, is that enough mysteries solved for you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I, um,” she wrings her hands. “I suppose it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Tenko says suddenly. “Ah, is it alright if Tenko asks a question?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko?” Ryoma says. “Something… off to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She bites her lip as she shifts slightly from foot to foot. “Tenko isn’t sure about that, and she also knows she wasn’t there for the Flashback Light, so maybe she’s just confused, but which killing game was Rantaro in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room goes dead quiet as the others stare at her in complete astonishment. Tsumugi is the first to recover, stammering, “I-I’m sorry, what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure if this is exactly related, but before we go any further,” she says. “Tenko thinks it might help her understand if someone told her which killing game Rantaro was in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi keeps staring at her. She finds herself saying again, “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Well, I certainly didn't manage to finish this fic by its anniversary, haha. For those who don't know, I've been studying abroad for the past few month and it's kept me more busy than I anticipated, so I've slowly been chipping away at this chapter and a few other projects whenever I had downtime, which also unfortunately means I don't think I can say for certain when the next chapter will be ready, though hopefully it will take less time than this one did, haha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also, I do hate to say this, especially since I know it's coming from a place of encouragement/excitement, but please do not leave comments asking when the next update will be or if I've given up on this fic. Again, I know they're coming from a very well intended place, but also remember I didn't write a 300k fic just to give it up at the end, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everyone stares at Tenko in stunned silence for a moment more. She fidgets under their gazes, though doesn’t seem inclined to say more without any prompting.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s still trying to find her bearings when Kaede speaks up. “Tenko,” she says. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Tenko isn’t sure how else to phrase it,” she says. “Tenko just… she was just thinking about what everyone told her about the Flashback Light and… how Rantaro fits into that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ch-Tenko,” Tsumugi says, regaining her composure. “What do you mean? Rantaro was just a student like us, right everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s…” Ryoma says. “He’s like Kokichi, or anyone else. Don’t remember anything special about anyone besides Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “But that doesn’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What about it doesn’t make sense?” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “Perhaps someone should actually go over what the Flashback Light showed us again. Tenko is obviously having a difficult time comprehending something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess I can do that,” Ryoma says before turning to Tenko. “Already told you most of this, but basically a long time ago, there was a school called Hope’s Peak. Then Enoshima Junko—the Ultimate Despair—and her cult—the Remnants of Despair—started, well,” he sighs, “would call it the apocalypse but earth somehow came back from that. Current apocalypse outside started later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “How does any of that relate to Rantaro?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No idea,” Ryoma says. “Anyway, Enoshima setup a killing game like the one we’re in now with students from the original Hope’s Peak. But then she died, the survivors escaped, and a group called the Future Foundation started putting the world together, beginning by rounding up the Remnants of Despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It, um,” Tsumugi says. “Gets a little weird after that. Maybe this is the part you’re having trouble understanding, Tenko? When the Remnants of Despair got put into a program world and a killing game was held among them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “No, Tenko knows all of that. The new Hope’s Peak was established and we all applied to be students, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says. “That’s all we know, so afraid you’re gonna have to tell us how Rantaro fits into that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shifts from foot to foot, pausing for a second to gather her thoughts. “The second killing game,” she says eventually. “Was with Remnants of Despair… like Kaede, right? And you didn’t remember anything special about Rantaro being a Remnant of Despair, so… he probably wasn’t there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“These events also happened years ago,” Maki says. “Any of us being there is impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what Tenko thought…” she says. “And there were no other killing games between those and the one we’re in, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tsumugi says. “Is there a problem with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “But the video Tenko saw of Rantaro… he said he survived a killing game before. That’s why he was the Ultimate Survivor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The what?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Ultimate Survivor?’” Maki asks. “Where did you hear that? What video was this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You might wanna start from the beginning, Tenko,” Ryoma says. “Seems like you have a lot more information than the rest of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Tenko nods. “Um, Tenko knows she wasn’t supposed to, but she went to go check on Kaede after everyone told her about the Flashback Light. And when she went to go see her, Kokichi gave her some instructions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks up at her. “Kokichi… gave you something? Do you still have it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says carefully. “Tenko got knocked out last night. She thinks someone came up behind her and forced her to smell something… and when she woke up the note was gone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Tsumugi says. “Why did you keep all of this secret until now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because Kokichi said not to tell anyone,” she says. “But… he’s not here anymore, so Tenko thinks maybe she should since,” her gaze briefly flickers to Kaito, “it was one of the last things he did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand through his hair but otherwise doesn’t respond. Kaede says, “I remember him giving you a piece of paper, but he never told me what it was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is Kokichi’s note where you got this information from?” Tsumugi asks. “If that’s the case we might want, um, to be careful with completely believing it then. Since, well, it <i>is</i> Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was the last thing Kokichi wrote,” Kaito says with a grave finality. “It’s his will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shrinks in on herself at the reproach. “Oh, ah, I didn’t mean that we shouldn’t hear it at all or anything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think we’ve talked around this enough,” Ryoma says. “Tenko—what’d the note say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It said,” Tenko begins, “to go to Rantaro’s lab on the fifth floor and bring an electrohammer to protect against Monokuma if he tried anything. But, um, Tenko was pretty nervous and after she went inside, she kinda freaked out and might have used it on nothing…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “Wanted you to go to Rantaro’s lab? We already investigated that earlier, but… he did have kind of a fixation on it, at least, he was interested enough that he blew the door to it open.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t really know about that—the directions just told her the combination to the safe so… she opened it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And inside was this video?” Maki says. “So that’s what you were doing on the fifth floor…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls up at the Exisal. “You were the one who attacked Tenko. Don’t even try to deny it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know what she was doing up there, then?” Ryoma asks Maki. “Also, were you the one who grabbed the note off her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I had no idea Tenko was going to be on the fifth floor,” Maki says. “I heard her making a racket when I was preparing my arrows in Shuichi’s lab. I knew if I wanted to avoid a fight, I’d have to knock her out and the chemicals were an easy convenience. It was pure chance we were there at the same time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “And the note? Were you the one who took it or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Maki says. “I had no idea what she was doing up there, let alone that she was carrying instructions apparently to one of the school’s secrets around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “Is that really true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you have evidence to prove otherwise?” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you have evidence to prove you’re telling the truth?” Kaede fires back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice sounds incredulous. “Are you asking me to produce the absence of a piece of paper to show that I’m not lying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “We can argue about that later. Tenko—you found a video in the safe in Rantaro’s lab. And that video said he was… the Ultimate Survivor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does a talent like that mean?” Tsumugi says. “Y-You don’t think there’s a chance that video was just another one of Monokuma’s tricks?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As unreliable a source of information as Tenko is,” Maki says. “I doubt Monokuma would hide something he’d want to use to torment us behind a reinforced steel safe with a combination we don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi falters. “Oh. Um, I guess that is a good point…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “Did Kokichi say how he got the combination?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “The note didn’t say where Kokichi got his information. Actually it said,” she scowls, “‘you’re probably too stupid to find where the combination is hidden in the school so I’ll give you a freebie.’ And then the codes Tenko needed were written after that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gives her a half smile. “He took the time to write all that out. Guess he… is always himself, no matter what’s happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Kaito—” before cutting herself off abruptly. “Tenko—keep going. You opened the safe and you found a video?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tenko says. “Um, well, actually Tenko found a flash drive to use on the laptop in Rantaro’s lab, but either way, there was a video on it of… Rantaro in his lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t…” Kaede trails off, brow furrowed in deep concentration. “His lab wasn’t opened until Kokichi used the Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tsumugi says. “And the stairs up to the fifth floor didn’t even exist when Rantaro was still with us. Most of the second floor didn’t even exist at that point. I mean, the school stopped being under construction only very recently, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “that… does seem strange. Tenko, are you sure the video was of him in his lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko doesn’t know any other place in the school with creepy red walls like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If Tenko’s absolutely sure,” Tsumugi takes a deep breath. “Then I think there are only two possibilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What are you talking about?” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I mean two possibilities for how a video like that could exist,” Tsumugi clarifies. “Rantaro couldn’t have recorded anything in his lab while he was alive—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “Tsumugi, if you say Rantaro is a ghost I am going to shoot you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi holds up her hands defensively. “I-I promise I wasn’t. I just was going to say that the video either has to be fake or… maybe Rantaro plainly wasn’t who he said he was when we first met him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her wide eyed. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks around, gauging the others’ reaction to her words. “Um, if you guys don’t mind, maybe I could try explaining my thinking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… would like to hear it,” Tenko says. “And she supposes it’s only fair we discuss it since Tenko was the one who brought it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want to hear it, too,” Kaito says. “I… don’t want to let any of this go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki adds after a moment, “I guess we’re in agreement then. Tsumugi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi swallows, eyes still lingering on the Exisal’s heavy weaponry as she begins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The video Tenko found,” Tenko says, “showed Rantaro in his lab. Tenko knows that is strange but… what does that mean about Rantaro?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We already established that he couldn’t have gotten into his lab earlier,” Maki says. “Unless something else happened then we weren’t aware of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Knowing this school,” Ryoma says. “Say there’s a pretty high chance of that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede says. “Rantaro never said anything about his lab or recording a video or anything, right? I mean, we know he had information we didn’t about the Ultimate Hunt so maybe he knew some other things too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head, “but why would he share that with us and not all this other crap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The reason why Rantaro would hide this from us,” Maki says. “Tsumugi, is that what you’re getting at?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But he had no reason to hide anything,” Kaede asserts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A sudden flash of realization moves across Tenko’s face, but she remains silent, biting her lip.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone,” Tsumugi says. “Think about what you said—there’s plainly only one reason why Rantaro wouldn’t tell us such important information about the layout of the school or his talent or if… was or was not in a previous killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you’re so sure,” Maki says. “Then spit it out already instead of trying to make a production out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi flinches. “I-I promise I wasn’t—oh, oh fine… um,” she recollects herself with a breath. “I just think the most plausible reason for Rantaro’s behavior is that, well, he must have been in league with the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets, shifting from foot to foot. “Rantaro was…” she looks down again, still chewing on her lip.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede seems too distraught to notice Tenko’s reaction as she shouts, “That’s—that’s not possible! Rantaro, he—he died trying to stop the killing game, right? He told us all he’d do everything to end it, and then he was trying to get into the mastermind’s lair, so obviously—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But then he was killed by the supposed mastermind,” Maki says. Kaede glares up at her, but Maki continues undisturbed. “Your theory has a few holes, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Didn’t we already decide back at Shuichi’s trial that Rantaro couldn’t have been the mastermind,” Ryoma says. “He didn’t have a cardkey or anything on him that could have gotten him into the room in the library. So if he was an accomplice… you think he was just waiting outside to be let in by the real mastermind or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “That sounds… really stupid. Also,” he shakes his head. “Finding any leads on the identity of the mastermind has been hell—would they really do something that could get them caught that easily?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is a good point,” Tsumugi says. “But maybe it was less Rantaro trying to get into the secret room and more… maybe he was just waiting for the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This all sounds like baseless speculation,” Maki says. “Do you have any evidence for this theory other than Rantaro potentially being in his lab before the game began?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I still think that’s pretty substantial evidence,” Tsumugi says. “And I was going to say… what if Rantaro was waiting in the library, but then he was betrayed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Betrayed? By the mastermind? Why would the mastermind betray someone they were working with?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m… not too sure actually,” Tsumugi says, shrinking back in on herself. “But, well, how else would you explain Rantaro having access to the rest of the school and not telling us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Maki says. “If we want to know why the mastermind would betray and kill their partner, we can just ask them. Kaede, why did—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not the mastermind!” Kaede shouts, throwing her hands up in frustration. “And can I just say the stuff Tenko already pointed out about Rantaro being in some weird third killing game makes the Flashback Light you guys saw saying I was the mastermind seem—I don’t know—wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “not sure how to reconcile those things, have to admit, and,” he nods across the room towards Tenko, “speaking of Tenko, seems like she’s got something else to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips her head at his words to see Tenko, still fidgeting restlessly. “Tenko? Is something the matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko starts at the sudden attention on her. “Uh, well, Tenko was just thinking more about the video she saw. Because in it,” she bites her lip, “Rantaro said that someone in the game already knew his true identity, and if he wasn’t careful someone would come after him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t sound like something an accomplice would say,” Kaito says softly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Maki says. “Did you know Rantaro’s identity before you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I didn’t. He told me he didn’t remember, and I believed him—I thought everyone did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not that this isn’t important,” Ryoma says. “But Tenko, Rantaro said all that so… who was this video for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, are you talking about the intended audience, Ryoma?” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Right. What Tenko said sounded like a warning, so who was this warning supposed to go to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himself,” Tenko says, voice barely above a whisper. “At the beginning of the video… Rantaro started talking like he was speaking to himself but,” she pauses, furrowing her brow as she debates how to phrase her next words, “it sounded to Tenko like Rantaro was talking to… a version of himself that he knew would lose his memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Rantaro,” Kaito says. “Knew? He knew Monokuma was gonna give us fucking amnesia?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-But wait,” Kaede stammers. “Rantaro knew we were going to lose our memories and that someone would target him or something a-and—and,” she throws her hands up, becoming increasingly agitated, “all he did was record a fucking video for himself!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods along, adding, “if he knew about that beforehand, too, that, well, that kinda adds to the theory that maybe Rantaro was working with the mastermind, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is… unsure,” she says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How can you be ‘unsure?’” Maki says. “Is there more to this video you’re not telling us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns, staring up at the Exisal, not intimidated in the slightest. “Tenko isn’t hiding information, if that’s what you’re trying to say.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s right,” Ryoma says. “Tenko, keep going—we won’t jump on you this time before you can finish explaining.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s unsure gaze shifts to him. “Thank you, Ryoma,” she says stiffly before taking a deep breath. “In the video Tenko found, Rantaro seemed to be addressing himself, and he said stuff about how he had survived a killing game before, which is why Tenko was confused about when that happened since there were only two killing games before this one. So… she wasn’t sure which one of those he participated in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe our working answer to that is ‘neither,’” Maki says. “Which only raises more questions we still need to work out. Continue.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scowls at the direction but follows it without further protest. “Rantaro also mentioned what Tenko said earlier about someone who knew who he was coming after him and then,” she frowns, “he also talked about something he had when he first came here, but Tenko has no idea what that could be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We didn’t find anything out of the ordinary on his body when he died,” Tsumugi says. “So maybe he left this, um, ‘something’ in his room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We can check after the trial,” Kaede says with a pointed glare towards Maki. “Assuming this trial has an end.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It will,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks between them, unsure for a moment before saying, “and there was one more thing—and Tenko thinks this might… answer our questions about Rantaro maybe being involved with the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did he address the mastermind?” Tsumugi says excitedly. “O-Or talk about any of their secrets? Or maybe a way to get out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “Nothing like that. Rantaro tried to talk about, um, Tenko thinks it was the two person graduation rule when it suddenly seemed like he got in trouble and said that he apparently wasn’t allowed to talk about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He was being monitored?” Kaito says. “So the mastermind was watching him or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko doesn’t know—Rantaro was the only person in the video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But he was already under someone’s control at that point,” Maki says. “So he probably was just a regular participant like us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks he might have been a little special,” she says. “The last important thing Tenko thinks, is that Rantaro said that the video and the extra something where his, um, ‘Survivor Perks’ for surviving a previous killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which brings us back to why the hell none of this makes sense in the first place,” Ryoma says, pulling on his hat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “And according to Rantaro’s account in the video Tenko found, the stuff we know about the killing games has to be false.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “But that can’t be right. I just… I <i>know</i> that can’t be right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why do you sound so sure?” Maki asks</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because,” Tsumugi says, taking a deep breath. “Because I—I can prove it. Just, please, give me a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a wary look. “Do you have… proof?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have an argument at the very least,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns but says, “Tsumugi, I know the Flashback Light was lying. Why do you doubt me so much?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not that I doubt you,” Tsumugi says. “But just… will you listen to what I have to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a moment, fiddling with her hat. Then, “Fine, but I’m telling you, no matter what it is, that Flashback Light was still wrong, and I’m still not the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… may be so,” Tsumugi concedes as they begin a new discussion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present you Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What you guys saw in the Flashback Light,” Kaede says. “It conflicts with what Tenko said about Rantaro, right? And we can’t just ignore that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s a chance Tenko is lying to protect Kaede,” Maki says. “But if that is the case, I can’t imagine why she would go to the trouble to make such a complicated story.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I say we believe Tenko,” Ryoma says. “After everything she’s done up till now, think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… thanks you for the support,” she says, still uncomfortable.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Kaito says. “The Flashback Light… just left out the stuff about Rantaro? Is that possible?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “Why would Monokuma bother to let you remember the first two killing games and then leave out another?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe there’s still another mystery there,” Ryoma says. “And he wants us to all find the answer for his own amusement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or maybe,” Tenko says. “The last Flashback Light… wasn’t true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And the other ones were?” Maki asks. “Was these something special about this one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know,” Tenko says. “But if all the Flashback Lights aren’t true then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We don’t know anything about our situation,” Kaito says. “And we’ve been fucking lied to this whole time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s it,” Tsumugi says. “Maki, what you were saying—I think that this is the only Flashback Light that wasn’t true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses for a moment, her words guarded when she finally says, “what makes you so sure of that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, um,” Tsumugi says. “The day we found it—er, I mean, how we found it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “Was just lying there on the table when me and Maki went to the cafeteria that morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And we all thought that was strange, didn’t we?” Tsumugi prompts. “That after having to search the school for each Flashback Light before, one was just plainly handed to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is… odd,” Ryoma concedes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what?” Kaede says. “Do you think that one was tampered with or something? But who would do that? Who here even has the ability to do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Maki says. “Assuming you’re not suddenly arguing for your own guilt, are you saying you believe all the Flashback Lights are fake?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The question isn’t as accusatory as Maki’s previous address to Kaede, and she narrows her eyes searchingly as she gazes up at the Exisal. “I’m… not sure,” she says. “Why are you asking me something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki again goes quiet for a moment then. “I just wanted to know where everyone stood on the matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says. “What are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s fine,” she says. “Anyway, I believe we can agree with Tsumugi at least for the moment. The last Flashback Light was… faulty.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives the towering machine at his side a dubious look. “You’re giving up that easily?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you think differently?” Maki asks back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “Think what you said is our easiest option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Easiest option?’” Tsumugi parrots, trying to keep her voice even in spite of the panic slowly coiling over her. The trial is about to end. There’s so little else left to draw out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs in response. “With what Tenko said, we know the Flashback Light was wrong—there’s not much of a debate there. Next question is if every Flashback Light was a lie or not, and if they were,” he pulls a cigarette from his pocket seemingly for the sole purpose of fiddling with it. “Then we have even less information about the outside world than we thought.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “So you’re saying it’s easier on us to just… believe for the hell of it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s gaze shifts to him. “Strange hearing that from you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “Do you have a fucking problem with me now, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma regards him for a moment longer before returning his attention to his cigarette. “Not sure if you want me to answer that honestly. But the point is we should just leave this here for now. It’s probably for the best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes dart between him and Maki, deeply unsure about what is happening and half desperately wondering if she could convince Ryoma to speak a little more on it somehow when Tenko speaks up. “Tenko still has one problem with the Flashback Light,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tenko,” Tsumugi says. “Did you remember one more thing about Rantaro?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s not—Tenko doesn’t know anymore about Rantaro,” she says. “Tenko wanted to know… why would someone use a fake Flashback Light to frame Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods, eager for the new topic. “That is a good question—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think I know,” Kaede says, renewed authority in her voice. “The time limit was ending and none of us were going to do anything, and the mastermind couldn’t have that. So,” she stares straight up at Maki. “The mastermind planted it to force a murder with me as the intended victim, and Maki fell for their trap.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice doesn’t falter for a moment as she evenly responds, “is that so?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—” Kaede cuts herself off, suddenly looking enraged. “What do you mean ‘is that so!?’ You—you were tricked and killed someone for no reason, and that’s all you can say!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe I’ve said everything else I could on the matter,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grips the edges of her podium, fury in her eyes, but before she can bite out another response, Kaito says, “Maki… is that true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s an odd expression on his face, and his gaze remains trained on the ground. “It’s just,” he furrows his brow. “Before all this shit… you kept saying over and over that you weren’t gonna let yourself be tricked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses, then sighs. “But it seems that what’s happened has happened. And when an assassin fails their mission, they are punished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki, you’re not just gonna let yourself—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “I never planned to just lay down my life. Maybe I will die, but I’m not about to simply let it happen without doing something to stop the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito speaks to her more, more pleading, more kind words, but across the room, past Ryoma’s odd silence, past Tsumugi’s strange fretting, Kaede hears something she doesn’t think she was supposed to in Maki’s words. Something that lifts her out of the strange angry fog that had clouded her since she stepped foot into the trial room. Her mind still dutifully repeats that Maki is guilty at the slight challenge. That Maki is the kind of person who would commit murder without a second thought. And yet…</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi speaks up. “W-Well,” she says. “Is there anything else left? Anyone notice anything or maybe have any other questions or evidence?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks she already shared everything she found,” Tenko offers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And no one else investigated,” Ryoma says, a conflicted expression still on his face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees Tsumugi look around beseechingly at the others, and though there’s a slight doubt running through her mind, Kaede remains quiet when her desperate eyes pass over her. Maki says, “Then I suppose it’s time to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Tsumugi says hurriedly, reaching into her pocket. “I did find one thing during the investigation. I’m, um, not sure exactly if it’s evidence, so I wouldn’t be comfortable just throwing it down and shouting ‘take that!’ or anything but… we should still plainly look over it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks at her to see a small piece of familiar cloth like fabric that even at her distance from Tsumugi she can identify as something that was once white but is now thoroughly stained with blood. “What,” Kaede says. “Is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems to regard it carefully, too, furrowing her brow as she says, “Tenko doesn’t think she saw anything like that in the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I found it in the bathroom,” Tsumugi says. “It was in the sink under a few rags that, er, I think were used to try and clean the press.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito winces at her words, and Maki quickly speaks over his reaction. “One of the tags likely fell off one of the washcloths due to overuse. Sometimes garbage is just garbage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think it’s important, Tsumugi?” Kaito says in spite of Maki’s words. “That it had… something to do with Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure,” she replies. “But I don’t know—it seemed… out of place to me at the time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can I take a look?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems a bit startled at his question, and casts a brief weary eye to Monokuma for permission before she hurries off of her podium to place it in Ryoma’s small hand before scurrying back.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he says after what Kaede thinks is approximately two seconds of inspection. “Not much of a mystery. It’s gauze that got covered in dried blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Gauze?’” Tsumugi says. “It was something that simple?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Seen a lot of the stuff lately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems crestfallen. “Oh, then it probably isn’t a clue, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why do you say that?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Um, well, because you were there in the hanger for a long time—I guess with your injuries, I just assumed that it was plainly left over from you changing the bandages on your arm or something.” She wrings her hands. “Is that… not right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No, it’s not. I was only there for a day, and when Tenko came to see me to bring supplies, she only ever brought more painkillers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true,” Tenko agrees. “Though Kaede should really change the bandages on her arm after the trial since she didn’t while she was in the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s garbage,” Maki says again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede opens her mouth, and Tsumugi beats her out by fractions of a second to stammer, “I-Is it?” as accusingly as she can.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “What the hell is happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think they’re using garbage to get a confession out of me that I’ve already given,” Maki replies. “But if you want to make a mystery out of nothing, then there’s nothing I can do to stop your idiocy. Though,” she pauses, “you should know that you don’t need to pry into everything that you don’t understand—I would think everyone here would have learned that after the last trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs at her hat, puzzling over the contradictory message in Maki’s words not to go further even as they confirm her suspicions. But Tsumugi speaks up before she can find any immediate answers. “I don’t think we can afford to let mysteries go unsolved here. We are in a class trial, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “I don’t know why I expected you to listen. Fine then—knock yourself out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With her resigned go ahead, Tsumugi adjusts her glasses and has a strange determination in her eyes than Kaede can't remember the other girl ever having before this trial.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let’s establish the facts,” Tsumugi says. “Kaede, the piece of gauze I found doesn’t belong to you, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “It doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe part of her bandages just fell off or something,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko thinks that is unlikely.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The piece looks like it was cut off of something,” Ryoma says. “Doubt anyone could just accidentally do that without noticing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi had an absurd amount of ‘supplies’ in the hanger,” Maki says. “And by ‘supplies’ I mean trash. It came from there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “Do you remember seeing anything like that when you were in the hanger?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No…” she says. “I don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “If it wasn’t brought by Kaede or Kokichi, then it was Maki. That’s the only other possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did Maki get hurt in the hanger?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal remains quiet. Kaito says, “Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma’s right,” Tsumugi says. “The only possibility is that Maki brought it. And well,” she adjusts her glasses confidently. “Ryoma also said it looked like it had been cut off of something, so that means it was probably part of a bigger piece that she used for something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito asks, “Maki, did you really… bring something like that to the hanger?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was prepared for anything,” she answers flatly. “And that included being injured.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi just said it was used,” Kaede says. “So you were hurt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says. “I was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“By Kokichi?” Tsumugi asks. “But how could someone like him attack—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito did it,” Maki says. “He mentioned it earlier and Kaede can also testify that we got into a fight in the hanger. It was just a few scratches at best, but I had the supplies and saw no reason not to treat the injuries.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “Maki…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi sounds disappointed. “Is that plainly all it was?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks. Most of that night in the hanger had been a pain addled blur, especially everything immediately after her getting shot. And yet… but before she can say anything else, Kaito asks, “did I really do that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says. “You did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He seems troubled but goes quiet again at Maki’s clipped reply. Kaede studies him, trying to see if Kaito will somehow give up the answers that the faceless metal of the Exisal won’t. Kaede doesn’t even know exactly what’s bothering her or what she’s looking for, but part of her almost instinctually feels she needs to keep Maki talking even as talk of the vote becomes to stir up again. And she also realizes she’s currently staring at the solution to her problem.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a sick guilt twist in her stomach and she can only think <i>sorry Kaito</i> before she presses forward. “Maki,” she says. “Are you really sure you’re okay with us just voting for you? I mean, you know what will happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Maki begins as if talking to a particularly slow child. “We have been over this at least a dozen times now already. I think everyone is well aware.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she says. “But this just isn’t about you—you remember what happened when Miu tried to fight back against her execution, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-Is that going to happen again?” Tsumugi stammers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki doesn’t answer her immediately, and Kaede continues, saying, “Maybe being inside the Exisal will protect you from whatever happens, but what about the rest of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said I don’t care about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “That’s not true. Maybe you’re fine with me dying, but all of us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says. “Stop fucking—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki says, “I’ll do what I need to if that happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you really think you can?” Kaede says. “You said yourself we don’t know what Monokuma’s capable of, and that also with the amount of injuries—with who’s injured—would you really be able to protect hi—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito growls, “I said stop. Leave her the fuck alone already—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because if you’re tricking us or trying to do anything to get out of being executed,” Kaede says. “You know exactly who you’re putting in danger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up! Just shut up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “Calm down. Kaede’s only doing this because she wants something. So what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her own pushing, Kaede finds herself blinking at the question. “You’re just…” she frowns. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m asking you what you want,” Maki says. “Would you like me to repeat myself a few dozen more times so we can extend this trial like you suddenly seem so intent on doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s fine,” Tsumugi says, speaking for her. “Kaede, is there something you wanted to ask Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with the brim of her hat at the sudden support. Simply asking Maki to keep speaking so she can find some error to let her actually figure out what’s wrong isn’t a possibility. But something, she knows from enough practice solving mysteries, is wrong. “I want to know,” she says. “Why you broke into my room earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that,” Maki says. “I wanted to find more clues regarding the mastermind and what they were capable of before attempting an assault on them. Part of any assassination is gathering information on your target first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito, of all people, again seems unsettled by her testimony. “Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And she still answers as calmly as ever, “Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing,” he says after a short pause. “Guess just… that was all for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, so,” Tsumugi says, again startling Kaede. “I might not be a detective, but even I know that plainly sounds suspicious. Kaito, do you know something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t answer, and Tenko hesitantly adds, “Maki talked with Kaito before the trial. Tenko thinks… maybe Maki told him what happened?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says excitedly before suddenly deflating. “But… nothing was taken. At least that’s what Kaede said earlier, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right…” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I didn’t find anything that linked you to the mastermind in anyway,” Maki says. “I assumed at the time it was hidden somewhere else, though if you really are innocent, I suppose that would also account for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait so,” Kaede says. “You broke into my room to try and find evidence that I was the mastermind, found nothing, and still decided to go after me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “That is strange. And what about Kokichi’s room? You said earlier you didn’t think he was the mastermind, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said I didn’t care if he was related,” Maki says. “I still decided to check his room since he was in the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “Guess it’s getting kinda obvious to everyone, but Maki’s lying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma?” Kaede says. “Do you know something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “It’s what’s been bothering me for a while now, but wasn’t sure how it was important to anything.” He glances up at the Exisal. “Now that Maki’s directly lying about it, starting to think it might be related somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki remains quiet at the accusation. Tenko says, “Ryoma was the only person who was in the dorms for the entire night. Tenko was with him earlier, but she didn’t hear or see Maki breaking into any rooms before she left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was there until Kaede and Kaito left the hanger,” Tsumugi says. “But… I don’t think I heard anything either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is because,” Ryoma says. “Maki’s lying about when she broke into the rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She didn’t do it before she went to the hanger?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “Heard sounds of someone trying to break down a few doors last night, and it was after Tsumugi left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “Maki has to be lying about why she did it, too. Because if it was after she killed Kokichi, then…” she frowns. “Why would you break into his room at that point?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki and Kaito both remain silent, though Kaede can see the latter wince at her words. Again, Tsumugi is the one to answer her. “I’m not sure,” she says. “But I think this is definitely something we should talk more about. After all, if Maki was trying to cover it up, then it’s probably important somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I think so, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then we can figure out the secret behind Kokichi’s death,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Secret?” Kaito says. “I already told you there is no…” he trails off, furrowing his brow in thought. Then he shakes his head, “I don’t care about the ‘why’ anymore. Can we just stop talking about this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaito,” Tsumugi says. “I think you know that isn’t a possibility anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stares up at her slightly dumbfounded, and it’s all Kaede can do over her own confusion to keep the conversation moving.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night,” Kaede says. “Maki broke into my room and Kokichi’s room, and it happened after the murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Maki lied about when it happened, but,” Tenko bites her lip. “Nothing was taken… so why did she do it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki clearly lied about her motive earlier!” Tsumugi shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Was alone in the dorms when it happened,” Ryoma says. “Sounded like she was in a panic trying to get the doors open. Was probably urgent then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kokichi…” Tenko says. “He was already dead at that point. What would Maki need after she killed him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well whatever it was,” Kaito says suddenly. “She obviously didn’t find it, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi flinches at the outburst. “No, I guess not…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “Ryoma, you’re the only witness to Maki leaving the hanger, right? Did you see anything or anyone else that night after Tsumugi left and before we all came back to the dorms later?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He fiddles with his cigarette in thought. “Well, during the night, I didn’t even see Maki. Was still stuck in the room, so I was basing everything off of what I heard, but her trying to take a few doors off their hinges made a pretty big racket. So,” he sighs. “No, that’s the only thing I heard when I was alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kaede says. “I think that’s still okay. If you can remember, did it sound like more than one person? Like was there any talking?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “Only heard one loud set of footsteps.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kaede says. “So that was another lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says. “Tenko’s confused. What was a lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods eagerly. “Right, let’s go back to make sure we’re all on the same page.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “I just think it’s strange that Maki would go alone. I mean, Kaito helped me up to the fifth floor, but he went back down to the hanger to try to give Kokichi the antidote pretty quickly. And, Ryoma, you never heard him return to the dorms, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” he says. “Thought it was Kaito coming back to the dorms that night until I heard it was apparently Maki the next morning. Don’t have your hearing, but the footsteps sounded too—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was me,” Kaito says. “I was the one who broke into Kaede and Kokichi’s rooms.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at him. “Kaito, are you lying again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he snaps. “I’m not. That night after I fucked up giving the antidote to Maki, she told me to try and find some shit in your rooms and that if I did…” he sighed, “the antidote was already gone, but she said she’d let Kokichi go, and I just… I had to do <i>something</i>.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are you telling them all that?” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand through his hair. “Maki, you know it doesn’t fucking matter. They’re gonna figure it out, and,” he shakes his head. “I don’t even know why you told me to keep it secret. That or Miu’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s the first to react to his words, parroting, “‘Miu’s lab?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “Maki wanted some crap from there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like what?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “That’s enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “Maki, just—just be honest with me: why? Why is it a secret? Why can’t you just tell me what’s happening? We made a promise that we would trust each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This isn’t about that,” she responds tersely. “This isn’t about me and you—this is about the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I don’t know what that means!” he shouts. “I don’t know what any of this means other than that you keep lying and hurting people and I don’t get it! And I’m trying—” he runs a hand through his hair, “I’m trying to help you, but you just keep lying, and I know I fucking lied, too, and shit, but I just don’t understand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses. Kaito sighs, the earlier energy falling fast away from it. “Forget it. You don’t have to answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I will,” she says finally.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede snaps to attention at her words. “Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose Kaito’s right—being direct is the only way to deal with this,” Maki says. “So I’ll be blunt. This is between me and Monokuma, and the only person you’re helping by asking questions is the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes in concentration, as if trying to physically get a closer look at Maki’s words. She had said herself so many times before that holding trials and playing the game was exactly what the mastermind wanted out of them, but there, staring at Maki and the memory of the night before, Kaede can’t see the same truth quite as easily. Maki’s a killer trying to weasel out of her crime, Kaede thinks. But she also thinks, <i>is that right?</i></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, Tsumugi says, “Maki, are you lying to us again? Just—after everything, you’re trying to trick us again, aren’t you? There is some big mystery behind Kokichi’s death, and you’re trying to manipulate us so we won’t find out what it is!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pauses, and Kaede finds herself oddly hanging onto whatever her response is going to be as Tsumugi again prompts, “Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose,” Maki says. “Asking you to trust me is out of the question at this point. But it’s fine. Any outcome is fine. Stopping the trial now would be preferable, but even if we keep going, I’ve made my point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says. “What? Are you just… trying to prove something to the mastermind? Is that why you killed Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I killed him,” she says. “To prove that this game is a farce and Monokuma is a failure of a game master.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels near stunned by the sudden declaration, and Tenko voices one of her burning questions allowed, “the murder wasn’t about killing the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma, however, speaks over her. “Hey, hey, hey! What’s the big idea just insulting me out of the blue like that? Didn’t your mother ever teach you to at least fire a warning shot first?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you know who you’re talking to?” Maki asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I could ask you the same question, missy!” He shouts back, raising his tiny paws in anger. “‘Failure?’ <i>Failure!</i> Never in my life have I been cut by such words, and bears have nine lives, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s cats,” Ryoma replies, completely deadpan.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And being so viciously insulted puts me in a catty mood, too, now that you mention it,” Monokuma says. “So I think I’m gonna take out my vengeance and ruin your cool and mysterious image.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “You’re gonna… insult her back or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “It seems Maki was right. Monokuma is a failure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah! To be bullied by my own class—and in my own court, too!” he whines. “No headmaster in their right mind would stand for this travesty!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what are you going to do?” Tsumugi asks. “Or are you just going to… sigh dramatically about it some more?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The time for sighing is over but the dramatics have just begun! In my epic plan to strike back,” Monokuma says. “I think I’ll reveal a teensy tiny bit of information to ensure this is a fair trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what would that be?” Maki asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His red eye gleams at her. “Oh, I think it’s only fair to share with the whole class exactly what was taken from the tragically deceased Miu’s lab. And I have to admit,” he says with a shrug, “I don’t really get it either, so maybe you kids can help me out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Help you out?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is exactly what I said,” Maki says. “Any help you give Monokuma is playing right into the mastermind’s hands. The only way to stop this is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And our mystery object that was transported by Kaito to Maki last night isssss,” Monokuma draws out. “The head of our former Ultimate Robot!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede has to stop herself from physically taking a step back at the information. “W-What!? Kiibo’s head!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gasps. “Kiibo—when Tenko found him in the hanger, Kiibo’s monopod wouldn’t turn on. Did Maki do something to him, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Ryoma says. “Did you ask Maki about why she'd even want something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, no, I mean,” Kaito shrugs helplessly. “It seemed weird, yeah, but I was pretty desperate last night. I figured the more time I spent asking questions, the less time Kokichi had, especially since I had to go to his room first to get the key.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki hisses. “Stop giving them information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems near frantic. “W-Wait hold on a second! So much there plainly doesn’t make any sense! First off, wouldn’t Kiibo’s body be disposed of like everyone else’s?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope!” Monokuma chimes. “Because you see, following his ill-timed and very annoying death, Kiibo was taken apart by Miu in her lab during the investigation. At that point he became less corpse and more scrap metal, and I figured it’d be pretty hard to count a bunch of bolts as a student. So I let it slide, though it is a bit of gray area, I’ll admit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Taken apart,’” Ryoma says. “So he was already disassembled when Kaito went to the lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “I’m good with tech stuff and crap, but taking off his fucking head without destroyed everything—that’s kinda beyond me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did Miu really need to do all that to save Kiibo’s A.I.?” Tenko asks. “And what does poor Kiibo have to do with this case?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi suddenly thrusts a finger in the direction of the Exisal. “Maki! What do you have to say for yourself!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing,” she says. “If you won’t listen to my warnings, there is nothing I can say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if you don’t argue,” Tsumugi says. “Then how can we… how can we solve anything? How can we end this trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says. “I think it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think we already have the information we need,” she says. “Or at least, something was said that I really think we should talk out… because it might just be the answer to all of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that would be?” Maki says, voice challenging.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kaede says. “Can you tell us again what you said about when you went to get, um, Kiibo’s head from Miu’s lab?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns and looks to Maki as if the impassive face of the Exisal would give him an answer. “Um, Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her only response is, “Trust me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares at her for a moment longer, then, “alright,” he lets out a deep breath. “Then I have nothing to say either. I didn’t plan on playing Monokuma’s game before the trial, and I’m not going to now.” He sends Kaede a withering glare. “You’re on your own, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her hands curl into fists. “Fine then. You don’t have to cooperate for me to still use your testimony. Everyone else, listen. Maki’s secret is more complicated than we thought it was, and I think I know why.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And in her determination Kaede doesn’t notice the slight smile curving over Tsumugi’s face.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just now, Kaito said something that contradicts Maki’s story,” Kaede says. “And I don’t think he even realized it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wouldn’t betray Maki,” Kaito snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think it’s too late for that,” Ryoma mumbles.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He said,” Tsumugi says. “Um, that Maki asked him to bring her Kiibo’s head for some reason?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu had already taken him apart,” Tenko says. “But Tenko doesn’t understand what any of this has to do with Kokichi or Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Tsumugi says, deep in thought. “She wanted stuff from Kaede’s room, Kokichi’s room, and Miu’s lab… but what for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito didn’t ask apparently,” Ryoma says with a sigh. “Even if he did, though, doubt we’re getting that information anytime soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not telling you anything,” Kaito bites back. “I believe in Maki. This—there’s something fucked up about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing was taken from my room,” Kaede says. “But something was taken from Kokichi’s. Kaito said it earlier—he needed to get the key to Miu’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Yeah? But that doesn’t prove anything.” He glances hesitantly to Maki. “Does it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When did Miu’s lab even get a lock?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She built it herself,” Kaede says. “And you just made my point for me. Kaito, did you know about the lock beforehand or did Maki tell you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stays quiet, still looking to Maki’s Exisal for guidance. Tenko says, “Kaito? You didn’t know, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He opens and closes his mouth a few times before finally saying, “No. I didn’t. But it doesn’t matter. Right, Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it does,” Kaede says. “Because Maki shouldn’t have known either. As far as I know, the only people who ever visited Miu’s lab were me, Kiibo, Kokichi, and Miu, herself. So why did Maki know about the lock?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko suddenly frowns. “Um, Kaede? Is that… right? Tenko means, she didn’t know about the lock either but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to her, trying her best to convey to Tenko to not point out her blatant lie. “Miu,” she says, choosing her words carefully. “Was pretty private about her stuff, especially after Kokichi stole her drone. And… she also didn’t exactly have a lot of friends, so I doubt someone as anti-social as Maki would just decide to pay her a visit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki remains silent in the face of her faulty accusation, and that is enough for Kaede to know there is something deeply, unsettlingly true about her hunch. After all, Kaede has few doubts that the real Maki would point out the time she carried Kiibo’s body all the way across the school to the place Kaede just claimed she had never been.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But that was a faded memory, and Tsumugi helps her once again, saying, “I see what you’re saying: the only people who should have known about the lock then would have been you, Kokichi, and Kiibo. And it’s probably safe to say Kaede didn’t tell Maki about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In spite of Tsumugi’s words, Maki’s defense is addressed only to Kaede. “You’re lying. I don’t know how, but you are. Falsifying evidence to help the mastermind—just how far are you willing to go to keep this game going?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Haru… kawa-san?” Kaede says, taken aback.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito, instead, presents the argument Kaede was expecting. “Then Kokichi or Kiibo told her! They were both in the hanger, right? She probably fucking asked Kiibo or something and he told her!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not good enough!” Tsumugi shouts back, again leaving Kaede blinking in her wake. “Because Kiibo might have known about the lock, but how would he have known the key was in Kokichi’s room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then she asked Kokichi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he just told her?” Tsumugi fires back. “You knew Kokichi. Was he really the kind of person who would just give up information like that, even if his life was in danger?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then she…” Kaito squeezes his eyes shut. “She tortured the information out of him—that’s what she used the knife for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “No, that doesn’t make sense. Why would she torture him for information she wouldn’t have even known she needed to know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To the side of their back and forth, Kaede hears Tenko mumble to herself, “What is happening… Tsumugi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede then begins to feel her heart hammer louder in her chest. With all of her pride at her earlier deductions, all of it fades as her mind loops that something is deeply, deeply wrong.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice rings out bright and clear over the escalating voices filling the room. “I used logic,” she replies. “Kokichi showed up to the dining hall with electrohammers and explained he got them from Miu’s lab. Clearly he knew how to get in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That still doesn’t refute my point,” Tsumugi says. “And also, if you’ll remember, Kokichi can pick locks, so even if you did know about Miu’s lab, why would you assume he had the key to it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So everyone will stop shouting,” Ryoma says, voice gruff. “I’ll say it. Only possibility is Kokichi just told her for no reason, right? There,” he tugs at his hat. “Don’t know what that accomplishes, but just… quit tearing each other apart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito gapes at his words. “Wait… what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kaede says, softer this time. “Just think—even if Maki had known about the lock, wouldn’t she have asked you to try and go to Miu’s room? And also… why did she need you to do it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His only response is to stare at her, wide eyed. Kaede glances up to Maki, but the Exisal makes no sign to indicate it’s going to interrupt her. “I don’t know why none of us thought to question this, but why did Maki stay in the hanger? She had the Exisal, and even if she did need to clean up the body, doing that and killing Kokichi couldn’t have taken all night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She…” Kaito responds, voice broken. “She kept Kokichi alive for awhile… at least she told me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki lied to Kaito about sparing Kokichi,” Tenko says quietly. “And Kaito changed his story a lot earlier, but did he even see Kokichi that night after he left with Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just hangs his head without a word. Maki chooses this moment to speak up. “So, the new story is that once we were alone in the hanger, I had a chat with Kokichi, killed him immediately after, and then made my requests to Kaito when he came to the hanger later.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tsumugi says. “And since it plainly doesn’t make any sense, it means there has to be more to what happened. And I don’t think we should rest until we find out the real secret behind Kokichi’s death. Everyone else thinks so too, righ—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not… Maki,” Kaede says. “Are you actually not the culprit?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi spins towards her. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What makes you say that?” Maki says, seemingly undisturbed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because,” Kaede furrows her brow, trying to connect the loose collection of pieces before her into something other than the impossible truth she knows she’s about to say. “I don’t think you can be you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Maki says. “You’ve lost your mind. I suppose that’s interesting, but, anyway, if it’s not me, then who have you decided in your sudden insanity is the culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede adjusts the brim of her hat to set it forward. There are so few possibilities, though all of them seem wrong to her. But if she wants the truth—and she has to want the truth—then there’s only one way forward.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Select So—</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or,” Maki says. “I can just tell you now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede stares dumbfounded. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was hoping to see this through to end, but I see now that I have done everything I logically could with this path of action,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki?” Kaito says. “What the hell are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kiibo says from the Exisal. “Please do not be too alarmed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And Kaede feels every single one of her theories shatter as Kiibo proceeds to apologize for tricking them all.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I would first like to thank everyone for their tremendous patience with this update and also provide the happy news that I should hopefully be back to a more regular schedule! It was a bit of a challenge getting back into writing this after pausing for so long, so I hope nothing seems off or too clunky. And also, as an aside, I don't usually think too much about game mechanics when writing trials, but, well, I had some fun with the ideas in this chapter as I'm sure you can tell, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice rings out. “Everyone, please do not panic. I know this may be difficult to comprehend, so I ask for your patience and understand—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck are you talking about!?” Kaito shouts, something fierce and desperate surging in his eyes. “Why the fuck are you here—where’s—where the hell is Maki!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Maki’s situation is a bit difficult to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what about Kokichi!?” Kaito continues. “You—you killed him? You’re dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am not… dead,” Kiibo replies. “I was simply transferred from Miu’s monopad to the Exisal in order to speak with you all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko is happy to see you alive, but she doesn’t know what that means. Where is Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dead!” Tsumugi gasps. “Sh-She has to be dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” Kaito snaps at her. “She’s not—we’re just confused. Kiibo’s confusing us for some fucking reason, but they’re not,” he clenches his jaw, wincing slightly. “There’s no way she’s dead. There’s no way Maki and Kokichi would both just die like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “Tsumugi has a point. Missing a class trial is against the rules, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Tenko says softly. “Did Monokuma kill her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, hey, hey!” Monokuma says. “Monokuma did what now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma turns a wary eye on him. “So you didn’t?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course not,” Monokuma says. “While in my role as headmaster, I wouldn’t hesitate for even a thousandedth—even a millioneth—of a second to punish any naughty rule breakers, but I would never keep such a thing quiet. I always have been quite the busybody bear since birth, I’ll have you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See!” Kaito shouts triumphantly. “She’s alive!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets, voice hesitating as she asks, “Then why isn’t she here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks like he’s about to shout again, when he suddenly falters, all of his bravado fading as quickly as it came. “I…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please, everyone,” Kiibo says. “If you’ll just allow me to explain, I can answer everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” Tsumugi asks. “So, um, how did you get into the Exisal? I didn’t think anyone besides Miu would have the ability to do something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m afraid that’s a bit complicated,” Kiibo says. “But I promise I will explain my situation after the trial, as unfortunately there are a few much more pressing problems I believe should logically be attended to first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Kaito says, voice haggard. “You know what happened to Maki? And Kokichi, too—” he cuts himself off, suddenly clasping a hand to his mouth.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Tenko shrieks in alarm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jerks her attention from Kiibo to the sound of Kaito struggling to catch his breath through his coughs. In spite of his efforts, blood trickles through his fingers, beginning to coat his hand and drip onto his T-shirt. “Kaito,” Kiibo says, voice laced with concern. “Please, try to calm down. Stress likely only makes your condition worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m—” Kaito manages between gasps. “I-I’m fine—just need… a minute.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede becomes as paralyzed as the others, completely unsure what to say as the sound of Kaito’s slowly subsiding coughs fill the room. Kiibo’s the only one to speak, saying again, “I apologize, Kaito, for any ill effect this may have had on you. Hurting you was not my intention, but still… I apologize if that has been the result.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you,” Kaito says as he finally recollects himself, smearing the blood lingering around his mouth onto the back of his sleeve. “I’m fine. Just—just shut up with your stupid apologies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, don’t be rude,” Tenko chastises, though her voice remains soft.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo says. “His response is understandable. I would actually like to apologize to everyone else as well for anything rude or hurtful I might have said. Please understand it was necessary to maintain my disguise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says, brow creased. “Why were you disguised at all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo lets out what sounds like a sigh. “I deduced that the best route to end this trial as soon as possible was to remain inflammatory so as to quickly provoke a vote without raising suspicion. However, as that has now failed, being straightforward is now my best option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why did you want an early vote?” Ryoma asks. “You’re… it’s impossible for you to be the culprit.” He glances to Monokuma. “Isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Monokuma says. “Well, in the event of the revival of a dead student as I so generously offered and you so woefully rejected, the revived would be reinstated as a participant soooo,” he shrugs. “Yeah, sure, why not. Zombie-mecha-robots are people, too, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Either way,” Kiibo says. “I can assure you I am not the culprit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then do you know who is?” Tsumugi asks. “You said you wanted this trial over fast, so if you just tell us, we can vote right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaito shouts. “We can’t just—we can’t just vote ‘cause if we do…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He trails off, and Kaede takes the moment to speak up for the first time since Kiibo’s appearance. “Kiibo, I’m not sure what you want to tell us, but the culprit is still Maki, isn’t it? Unless you can tell us something that proves otherwise, there is no other possibility, is there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses. “While that may be the case, I am afraid there is a bit more to it than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like what?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “You… do you know the secret behind Kokichi’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t answer immediately, and Kaito prompts, “Well?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Excuse me, but I need to be careful about the information I share,” Kiibo says. “We are currently in the midst of one of our best possible opportunities to end the killing game, and I cannot afford to reveal something that might damage that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘End the killing game?’” Tsumugi repeats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mentioned that earlier,” Kaede says. “When you were pretending to be Maki. Something about proving the game is a sham and Monokuma is a failure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “This might be a stupid question, but who exactly are you trying to prove that to, by the way? All of us know this game is nothing but mindless suffering, and seriously doubt the mastermind cares.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is a good point,” Tsumugi says, hugging herself. “And we’re… the last people alive, right? Maybe the last Flashback Light tried to trick us about some things, but the secret of the outside world…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls at his hat. “That… did seem awfully real to me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kiibo says. “And it’s hard to explain, but believe me. I have strong reason to believe that this killing game is larger than us and something like this is the proper way to truly end it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns as she thinks over his words. “What do you mean ‘something like this?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And also what do you mean ‘proper?’” Tsumugi asks. “Not to be morbid, but, um, don’t we end the killing game by killing the mastermind? Assuming something horrible doesn’t happen and we end up having to wait until there’re only two of us left, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “Killing the mastermind is… too sensationalized. Exposing them would be useful but killing—while morally wrong, as well—is inappropriate for our situation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tenko says, nervously fidgeting with her hands. “What is appropriate?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A mistrial,” Kiibo says. “A trial where for whatever reason, Monokuma cannot judge it fairly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s brow creases in concern. “A mistrial? And you’re saying—are we plainly in a situation like that now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If my suspicions are correct, then we have the opportunity,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that… ends the killing game?” Ryoma asks. “We prove the mastermind isn’t doing their job and they just give up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Less that they give up and more that they have lost faith and cannot continue,” Kiibo says. “I am sorry—this is all rather difficult to explain, I know. However, if achieved, I believe it has a non-negligible chance for success.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” Kaito says, eyes narrowed. “But for all this vague crap to work, you wanted us to vote for Maki? If we vote for someone, they die. Either they get executed or we’re wrong and they get killed along with the rest of us. How in the hell is sacrificing Maki supposed to stop the killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses. “It’s not about sacrificing anyone. In fact, if all goes well, this trial should have the very last deaths of the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Very last deaths…’” Tenko says. “Someone still has to die…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ideally not,” Kiibo says. “But I cannot ignore that as a possible outcome. One route to avoid such a happening would be to have everyone agree to unanimously abstain from voting, which I believe Kaede proposed many trials ago, however… that is dangerous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-Not just dangerous—that’s suicide!” Tsumugi says. “Not voting is against the rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why it’s risky,” Kiibo says. “One or two not voting would likely only result in their deaths. It requires the cooperation of the entire group, and at this point, such a thing is likely impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “Don’t say it’s impossible. All we gotta do is just have everyone commit to it, right? So it’s decided—I’m not gonna vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko says. “What do you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki’ll live, right? If we don’t vote, she can’t get executed,” he says. “And that’s good enough for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Tsumugi says. “How can you just say that!? I know you want to help her, but all of this is just too risky! I-I don’t know what Kiibo wants, but is it really worth potentially throwing our lives away?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know it is a lot to ask,” Kiibo says. “Which is why I did not propose it in the first place. Instead, I do need to insist that the vote continues the way I originally suggested. If everyone is satisfied, our best course of action is to vote for Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I already told you,” Kaito says. “There’s no way in hell I’m doing that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo sighs. “Kaito, I understand how you feel, but please try to be rational. Maki is the undisputed culprit behind this case, and voting for her is the most logical way to see you all through this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grips the edges of his podium, clenching his jaw. But before he can snap at Kiibo again, Kaede says, “Is that true? That Maki… is the only potential culprit?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kiibo says. “I just said that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “But… I’m having trouble believing it without evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kiibo says. “I was an eye-witness to the events that took place in the hanger that night. I believe I know what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then can you tell us?” Tsumugi asks. “Just so there’s no room for doubt?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo hesitates for a moment. Then, “I was hoping to avoid going into details regarding Kokichi’s death in order to keep emotional stress to a minimum, but if it is necessary for further progress, I suppose I have no choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods at his word even as she feels her earlier doubts slowly begin to surge anew.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That night,” Kiibo says. “I was still located within Miu’s monopad, which was on the floor in the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you turned yourself on?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” he says. “I had remained off for a good portion of the night in order to investigate certain aspects of my programming, but I finished and decided to share my findings with Kokichi and Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But by the time you turned back on,” Tsumugi says. “Kaede had already left the hanger with Kaito, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Correct,” Kiibo says. “At this point, I believe Maki was engaged with Kaito in conversation as I heard their voices in the background. Kokichi seemed hurt but was available, so I attempted to address him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What did he say?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He… had difficulty speaking,” Kiibo says. “The poison was beginning to affect him greatly at that point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito squeezes his eyes closed. “He didn’t say anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing that stood out,” Kiibo says. “And when he saw Maki smash the antidote bottle, he stopped talking to me entirely.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Tenko says. “Died from the poison then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There can be no doubt,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo, wait,” Kaede says. “I want to ask you a few questions about what you just said.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” he says. “Was there a problem with my account?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She nods. “Yes. First—you voluntarily talked to Kokichi last night in the hanger?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes…” Kiibo says slowly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there something wrong with that?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo talked to Kokichi and me a few times that day,” Kaede says. “But he was still angry with Kokichi and told me pointblank that he would prefer not to talk to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kiibo says. “Please, give me a little credit. I may have been upset with Kokichi at the time, but I would not let my personal feelings conflict with my mission in assisting all of you escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is…” Tenko says. “Is that true? Kiibo, you refused to speak with Tenko or anyone else for days after Miu’s death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “Kiibo, are you lying to us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Absolutely not!” Kiibo stammers, appalled at the accusation. “Yes, I would have preferred to speak to Kaede at the time, but when I turned on, I noticed the state Kokichi was in and decided that communicating with him was more important than holding out for someone more… favorable to talk to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were able to tell how Kokichi was doing from just when you turned on?” Ryoma asks. “And you didn’t think it was a trick or a lie or anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo says. “Please understand at the time I felt I had very important information to deliver.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks up at him. “Really? What kind of information?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses. “I’m afraid… I believe it would be unwise to reveal that right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because one of us is the mastermind, right?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Correct,” Kiibo says. “I am sorry to admit that I doubt my friends, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “Did—did you believe that Kaede and Kokichi both couldn’t be the mastermind? Tenko knows she, um,” her eyes dart nervously around the room, “asked you to tell them about the Flashback Light, but… you never told her what you thought about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi shared rather compelling proof regarding his and Kaede’s innocence,” Kiibo says. “After that, even with his rather… dubious track record, I felt inclined to believe him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “When did he tell you that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When Tenko first brought me to the hanger,” he replies. “Kokichi demanded I talk to him first while you spoke to Tenko. He explained his reasons then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Why did he—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kiibo says. “If you do not mind me speaking over you, I feel the need to repeat that I dropped my disguise in order to more directly express what I was trying to say earlier. Solving the mysteries around this case is playing right into the mastermind’s hands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You keep saying that,” Kaito says. “But… then you say crap that sounds suspicious and you still haven’t told us where the hell Maki is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know, and I apologize again, but it cannot be helped,” Kiibo says. “Also understand that right now, your choices are either to trust me or to trust Monokuma. Even if I may seem suspicious, I would hope that choosing between the two of us would not be too difficult.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s,” Tsumugi says. “Not really an answer. Actually, you kind of just admitted you were plainly acting suspicious and lying to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” he says. “And I’m afraid that still can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls at the brim of her hat, thinking over his words and all of the slight problems with them when Kaito speaks up. “Kiibo, even if you’re hiding a bunch of shit from us, can I still ask you one thing? You said Kokichi… that he—you told us what happened to him. But what about Maki? Were you the one who told her about Miu’s lab and wanted me to go get your fucking head for some reason?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Know he had a grudge against Kokichi,” Ryoma says. “But would Kiibo really just answer Maki’s questions after watching her kill someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re right,” Tsumugi says. “That’d be heartless even for someone made out of tin.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can assure you I did no such thing,” Kiibo says. “And also that is robophobic… and inaccurate. My metal composition was primarily—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kokichi told her?” Kaito presses. “Did she—” he cuts himself off briefly, his own words making him grimace. “Did Maki really torture him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hugs herself. “I found an arrow covered with blood while I was investigating the hanger. From what Kaede told me, I assumed it was the one Kokichi was shot with. And… I was wondering why Maki would have gone to the trouble to remove it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That must have been…” Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko can’t even imagine how painful that must have been. Poor Kokichi, no one deserves something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kiibo sighs. “I was hoping not to have to go into details, but… that is all correct.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our theory was right?” Kaede says. “Kokichi was dying of the poison and Maki tortured him for information before letting him die—that’s what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kiibo says. “Due to my position, I was only able to see parts of what took place, but from my understanding… yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “I see. Then, Kiibo, can you answer one more question for me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course, Kaede,” he replies solemnly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you stop lying to us?” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says. “You—it’s a lie? That’s not what…” he jerks to look at the Exisal. “Why the hell would you lie about something like that!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I am telling the truth!” Kiibo protests. “I promise I would not try to deceive you about something so serious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Tsumugi says. “I believe in Kaede. If she says Kiibo is lying to us, then I believe her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a nice sentiment… I think,” Ryoma says. “But I’m not even sure what Kaede thinks is a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Don’t worry. I plan to make the contradiction in Kiibo’s testimony clear. Then maybe we can get some actual answers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, everyone,” Kiibo pleads in vain. “Please, trust me. I promise I’m on your side.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tsumugi says, voice stern. “To speak plainly: that remains to be seen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do not understand this hostility…” Kiibo mutters softly as Kaede prepares herself to interrogate him again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede said Kiibo lied to us,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks it had to be something he just said… right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did not tell any lies!” Kiibo says. “I only gave my account of what happened to Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He said he died from the poison,” Ryoma says. “Or that Maki tortured him to death for information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure,” she says. “But Tenko thinks we already talked about that. That Maki shouldn’t have even known Kokichi knew…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “You’ve got a lot of fucking nerve trying to lie to us about Kokichi. You said he was in so much pain, he couldn’t even talk. Why the hell would you make something like that up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would never do such a thing!” Kiibo protests. “Why won’t you believe me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you have any evidence?” Tsumugi asks. “If you could prove it, then we’d believe you but since you’ve already lied to us once…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We can’t trust him, can we?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone,” Kiibo says near hopeless. “Please…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s it,” Kaede says. “Kiibo, you said the poison was affecting Kokichi badly enough that he couldn’t speak. If that’s true, then Maki couldn’t get information out of him no matter what she did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!” Kiibo shouts. “Please listen—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you were fucking lying about that!” Kaito shouts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gasps. “If Kiibo is lying does that mean he really is the killer somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the very least,” Ryoma says. “He’s hiding something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the way that Kokichi died, right?” Tenko asks. “When he was pretending to be Maki, Kiibo kept trying to hide that fact, too, so… what did happen to Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “What can we deduce from Kiibo’s lie? Does this mean he told Maki everything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo’s voice barely rises above the chatter in his defense of himself. “I can explain! Everything is not what you think it is! I promise I am on your side!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care what shitty excuse you have,” Kaito says. “Pretending to be Maki and then making up all this crap about how she hurt Kokichi—you really expect us to believe that this is all for our own good?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… it’s…” Kiibo falters. “Everything I’ve done since this all began was for you. I know it might be painful, but please believe that I mean it when I say my number one priority is to keep you safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tsumugi says. “Didn’t you propose earlier that we not vote? How is that keeping us safe?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo doesn’t answer, and Kaede takes the opportunity to regain control of the conversation. “I think our best choice is to just ignore him for now and try to solve the mystery in front of us. If we can do that, then maybe we can figure out exactly why Kiibo would lie in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… sounds reasonable,” Tenko says. “Okay, Kaede, where do you think we should begin?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our new information seems like the best place,” she replies. “According to Kiibo, both he and Kokichi didn’t tell Maki the information she needed in order to get Kaito to search for the key to Miu’s lab. Right now, there’s no reason why she should have suspected that Kokichi had it in his room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would Kiibo have even known that?” Ryoma asks. “That Kokichi stole the key?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede mulls over his words for a moment, answering slowly as she thinks. “No… Kiibo was mostly just with Tenko after Miu’s execution, and I don’t think there’s any reason why Kokichi would have mentioned it to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the only person who knew,” Tsumugi says. “Was Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Ryoma says. “Did Maki say anything suspicious when she was asking you to get her stuff?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “No, I don’t think so. She kept,” he lets out a shuddering sigh. “She kept apologizing to me and telling me to trust her and shit, but I thought that was just due to… her killing Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it matters,” Kiibo says. “I do believe Maki felt genuinely sorry for hurting you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “Go to hell.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, a-anyway,” Tsumugi says. “Kaede, did you say you had an idea?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pulls at the brim of her hat. “I’m not quite sure yet,” she says. “But from everything we know, I think the only possible solution is… I think Kokichi just told Maki voluntarily.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why would he do something like that?” Ryoma says. “You know that implies she just told him what she wanted and he helped her out, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “But what other possibility is there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it is the only possibility,” Tenko says. “Then Tenko thinks it has to be true, but… Tenko saw the scene of the murder. Tenko,” she cradles her head in her hands, “Tenko saw how everything was destroyed. She saw all the blood…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods solemnly. “I saw it, too. But from what we talked about earlier, maybe some of the blood was Maki’s, too. I mean, assassins like her could probably just shrug off injuries for a while, so maybe it wasn’t all Kokichi’s. At least,” she hugs herself, “I hope it wasn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito sighs. “It was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How do you—” Kaede starts to ask.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I lied earlier when I thought it was Maki,” he says. “Kiibo made up something about me hurting her, and I just went along with it because… fuck.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito…” Tenko says sympathetically.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi, however, presses ahead. “Then wait—if Maki didn’t get injured, why did I find a used bandage in the bathroom?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “That’s… that’s right. And that means…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito said Maki was not hurt,” Tenko says. “But there was a used bandage at the scene of the murder…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki didn’t happen to patch you up, Kaito?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “Nothing like that happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede already said it wasn’t hers from earlier,” Tsumugi says. “But the only other person who was in the hanger was Kokichi, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But—Tenko’s confused,” Tenko says. “Wasn’t Maki the one who brought the gauze?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She was…” Kaito says. “But Kokichi was the only other person there after I left with Kaede. And I doubt… he wouldn’t do anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki was an assassin and Kokichi was shot with a poisoned arrow,” Ryoma says. “Whether or not he ‘would’ doesn’t matter. At that point it’s just impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “Are we just plainly missing something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose I am not allowed to answer that question,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “That’s the only possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the hell are you talking about?” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her shoulders. “From what we know, the only person who would have needed something like a bandage is Kokichi. And since Tsumugi found only a scrap left, then we can only assume that his injuries got taken care of somehow.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi mentioned she found the arrow Kokichi was shot with, too,” Tenko says. “Would that mean that the arrow was removed not to hurt Kokichi but… to help him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Maki was still the one who brought the supplies to do that,” Ryoma says. “And it seems unlikely that Kokichi would have managed to steal them, remove the arrow and treat his wounds without her noticing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wait,” Tsumugi says. “That means Maki had to know, and,” she frowns. “Didn’t Kiibo tell us earlier that she brought the gauze as a ‘just in case’ sort of thing. Was that a lie, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “I—I’m not sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the very least,” Ryoma says. “Doesn’t this all mean that Maki was fine with Kokichi taking care of a wound she inflicted, and she was still planning to kill him later?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… doesn’t sound right,” Tenko says. “But why would Maki help Kokichi? She shot him and poisoned him a-and brought a knife to torture him and even crushed his dead body under the hydraulic press.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Tsumugi says. “Maybe this is too plain an answer, but from what we know… maybe all of that stuff somehow… isn’t true?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean,” Kaito says. “Maki—she didn’t kill Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo says. “She did. However, you are right. The situation is… more complicated than I made it out to be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, unsure how to address him. “I’m starting to realize that, but I don’t understand. I don’t think any of us do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That seems to take Kiibo off guard, and he asks, “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean,” she says. “We know why Maki went to the hanger, and, well, we know Maki. She was trying to kill me—the fact that there’s anything more to this case than a murder weapon and a corpse is just weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki said she wanted to prevent a trial,” Tenko says quietly. “That’s why she… cleaned up Kokichi’s body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But even that doesn’t really make sense anymore,” Kaede says. “Because Maki only ever had two goals, didn’t she? Kill the mastermind and protect Kaito. Why would she even go to all this trouble?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito glares at her. “You know she was more complicated than that—killing people and shit wasn’t that simple to her. If you knew about her past—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then maybe I’d cry for her and not the person she murdered?” Kaede snaps. “When you kill someone here that means you’re ready to put everyone else in danger, and you want to just give her a free pass because her orphanage or whatever was mean to her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You are such a fucking hypocrite,” Kaito snarls. “Maki’s the only person you’ve ever treated this way. You only ever saw her as this mindless killer, and that’s exactly why she hid her talent. Yeah, she fucked up a lot, but you refused to even give her a chance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scoffs. “So it’s suddenly my fault that she literally killed someone because I didn’t play nice with her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How many goddamn times do we have to have this fight?” Kaito runs a hand through his hair. “And you know what, Kaede, you killed someone, too, and you forced us all to have a trial, so what does that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was ready to die during that trial!” Kaede yells. “I never ran away from what I did to Rantaro. I never hid behind robots or mechas or whatever other stupid traps Maki used to try and distract us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede—” Kiibo begins to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma cuts in, quietly advising, “if you’re gonna say something about robophobia, I’d save it for later.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t notice the exchange as all her focus remains locked on Kaito staring her down. “Maybe back then I intended to kill someone, but that does not make me the same as Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Intended to kill…’” Tenko mumbles to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why are you so obsessed with being better than her!?” Kaito shouts. “We have no fucking idea if she’s dead or alive or where the hell she even is and you’re still going on about how she’s so much worse than everyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s a killer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks she thought of something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re all killers!” Kaito yells back. “Don’t you get it—we’re all capable of ‘just’ trying to save ourselves or doing ‘the right thing’ or whatever other shitty excuse we use to kill someone. And you know as well as I do that we can’t keep fucking holding that against each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Just because ‘everyone’s doing it’ doesn’t mean she shouldn’t be held accountable for murdering someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Held accountable?’” Kaito says. “What the hell do you think the class trial is? But you started this trial, so of course you must just be so fucking happy that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has something she wants to say!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wanting justice for my friends who have literally died isn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Knock it off with your justice bullshit! Nothing about this game is ‘just’—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko would really like to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re literally arguing for letting a murderer just get away with killing one of your friends!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, because you’re trying to fucking kill her right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees red and opens her mouth to say anything to shut Kaito up when Ryoma’s voice cuts through the room. “Both of you—stop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says, “I’ll stop if she—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko has something she wants to tell us about the case,” Ryoma says, eyeing both Kaede and Kaito carefully. “I think we should listen to her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—” Kaede glances over to see Tenko and feels the fight suddenly drain out of her. “Yeah, we… we should.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think we should, too,” Tsumugi says. “What is it, Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko seems uncomfortable under the sudden shift in attention, and she eyes Kaito as he sighs and shakes his head before she speaks. “Tenko was just… she was thinking about what Kaede said earlier. And about what Maki—or, Kiibo—said earlier about ‘intent to kill.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help herself from jumping in. “What about it? I thought it was pretty clear that’s what Maki’s motive was—she wanted to kill the mastermind, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But…” Tenko says. “She didn’t. And when Kiibo was pretending to be her, he just said Kokichi’s death was collateral, and that she’d kill whoever was in her way, but she didn’t hurt Tenko that night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was no logical reason to kill you, Tenko,” Kiibo says. “Maki wanted to prevent a trial—a death within the school of someone she did not suspect would have been counterproductive to her goal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma stares up at the Exisal. “But that’s true for Kokichi’s death, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… suppose it is,” Kiibo says. “However, the circumstances there were different.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Were they?” Tsumugi says. “I mean, I know I wasn’t there, but I feel like someone like Maki wouldn’t just let her target go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She gave me a choice on who to save,” Kaito says, gaze trained on the ground. “She let Kaede leave so she could get me out of there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede huffs but nods in agreement. “That’s why she shot me in the first place. Both arrows were poisoned and Kaito was forced to help one of us leave to get the antidote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Tsumugi says. “And I think… that plainly doesn’t make sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How so?” Kiibo says. “Kaede and Kaito explained the situation in full.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They did…” Tsumugi says slowly. “But I think Kaito might be right. I think what we’re missing is… we really don’t understand Maki, do we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede balks. “What are you—of course we understand her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma murmurs, “some of us do better than others…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips her head to look at his strangely accusing words when Kaito speaks up. “Tsumugi, what are you trying to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” she says. “Tenko was saying it earlier that Maki’s actions and what we know about her seem weird together. So… I think we should talk more about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but defensively cross her arms as the others begin to talk, Tsumugi guiding them along the way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki’s motivation,” Tsumugi begins. “Was it really just to kill the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there another reason why she would have gone to the hanger?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s no chance Maki just wanted to talk is there…” Tenko says. “Kaede said she showed up armed with a crossbow, and Tsumugi found a knife in her bag.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t sound like someone who just wants to talk to me,” Tsumugi says. “But she also brought bandages and asked Kaito for strange things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And those things just seem weird,” Ryoma says. “Kaito, do you remember her doing anything else weird?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think so,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi prods. “Did Kaede or anyone else notice anything suspicious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did not make note of any strange behavior,” Kiibo volunteers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, well,” Tsumugi says. “I wasn’t really asking you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says slowly. “That I might remember something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi perks up at her words. “Really? What is it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t really think anything of it at the time,” Kaede says. “But when Kokichi and I were hiding from Maki… he kept saying how weird it was that we were both going to die or that it was ‘funny’ that she gave Kaito a choice in who to take with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “I didn’t think anything about that was funny.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it probably wasn’t,” Tsumugi says. “But I think Kaede is right. If Maki wanted to kill the mastermind why would she just let you take whichever of them you wanted with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because Maki wanted Kaito to leave the hanger,” Kiibo says. “I believe we went over this before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We did,” Kaede says. “But now that I’m thinking about what Kokichi and Tsumugi said… Maki’s motive and her actions don’t match up. And,” she furrows her brow. “I think Kokichi figured that out when we were still in the hanger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that why,” Kaito says suddenly, “why he volunteered to stay behind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip. “Maybe. And if Maki did help him with his injuries, I guess they might have talked to each other so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She stops, fiddling with the brim of her hat as she keeps thinking. Tenko says, “Tenko doesn’t know if she understands. Did Maki really come to the hanger to talk then? Tenko thinks—oh!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko cuts herself off as something unseen catches her attention and she begins to rifle through her pockets. As she does so, Kiibo says, “That is still highly illogical. As we know, both Kokichi and Kaede were attacked, so the possibility that Maki wanted to communicate with them is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko?” Another Kiibo says, his voice coming from Tenko’s podium. “Hello! I apologize for my absence if you have been trying to contact me, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo!?” Tsumugi shouts in alarm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede darts to look at Tenko holding Miu’s old monopad in her hands. The familiar sight of Kiibo’s face on it makes her jaw drop. “Tenko, is that…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Softly from the Exisal, Kaede hears Kiibo’s voice mutter, “shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck is going on?” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, T-Tenko doesn’t know,” she says. “Kiibo, did you just turn yourself on?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did,” he says. The two words alone are enough to make everyone else quickly exchange hurried and confused glances. “For some reason I was having difficulty functioning earlier, however, whatever was disabling me seems to have passed and I can find no lasting effects.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko briefly glances up to the others for some indication of how to continue the conversation. Kiibo prompts, “Tenko? Is something wrong? You appear distracted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No, Tenko’s fine, but Kiibo,” she says. “You’re only here, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The projection of Kiibo’s face draws its animated features into a frown. “I am unsure what you mean.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu mentioned she could make copies of you,” Kaede improvises. “I know it was a long time ago, but that… hasn’t happened by any chance, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I do not believe it has to my knowledge,” Kiibo says. “Is that Kaede? Who else is here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone,” Ryoma says. “We’re in a class trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a pause before Kiibo says, “I see,” from the monopad.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, fuck subtlety,” Kaito says turning to face the Exisal. “Who the hell are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal remains silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it’s not Kiibo,” Tsumugi says. “Then were they just using the voice changer to try and pretend to be him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone pretended to be me?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Currently is pretending,” Ryoma says. “Though I think they just gave it up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “You were in the hanger last night. Do you know anything about what happened to Maki and Kokichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps eyeing the Exisal suspiciously as Kiibo says, “I do not. I spent most of the night attempting to finish running my programming, particularly since I suffered an unexpected setback while trying to do so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What kind of setback?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A power malfunction,” he says. “It was similar to the one I just recovered from. I am beginning to worry that running additional programs is too much for Miu’s monopad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, okay, whatever,” Kaito says still staring at the Exisal. “I asked you a damn question. Who the hell—” he brings a hand to his mouth and lets out a wet cough as he finishes his question, “—a-are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal stays quiet as Kaito coughs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “Why are you trying to hide your ident—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well that was rather unfortunate timing,” the Exisal says, still using Kiibo’s voice. “This is exactly why I wanted to end the trial early.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You—just,” Kaito snaps even as he continues to wipe the blood off of his mouth. “Just tell us the truth. Who the hell are you!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Someone who hasn’t given up yet,” the Exisal says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi points a shaky finger at it. “So you are just trying to get away with murder and beat us, aren’t you? We already know, so just admit it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You misunderstand,” the Exisal says. “I’m going to lose the trial—but there’s still a chance one of you will figure it out. That’s what I haven’t given up on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches it carefully as if some movement of its mechanical arms would betray its true intentions. “Figure what out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal doesn’t respond to her, and instead Kiibo speaks up, asking, “Excuse me, but is whoever is in the Exisal the person you mentioned who was pretending to be me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tenko says. “We thought they were you—well first, Tenko thought it was Maki, but now we’re just kind of confused.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still has to be Maki,” Ryoma says. “Not sure why she’s going to all this trouble though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki is inside the Exisal?” Kiibo asks. “Why is she—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She killed Kokichi,” Kaito says. “And she’s hiding in there to stop Monokuma from executing her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kiibo says. “Am confused. You seem unsure on whether you’re sure it’s Maki or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clears her throat. “Ah, well, it kind of has to be Maki because we’re all here, and… Kokichi is dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He is?” Kiibo asks. “When did this happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night,” Tenko says softly. “The Monokuma File said he died at some point between midnight and two in the morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Kiibo’s response is, “huh.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scoffs. “Kiibo, I know you didn’t like him, but come on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh no! I did not mean it in that way!” he clarifies. “I just thought it was rather strange since that was the time period where I suffered my power malfunction last—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” the Exisal says, however strangely the words sound coming out in Kiibo’s voice. “Don’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s the first to react to the interruption. “Why don’t you want him to say anything?” The Exisal stays quiet. Tsumugi sighs. “Well, now we know we have the culprit cornered like a rat. At this point we just really need to think like them—get in their head. Think like a rat—<i>become</i> the rat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Tsumugi?” Tenko asks. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t reply, still murmuring to herself. “Think, think. Why would the culprit not want Kiibo to talk?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s a witness,” Ryoma says, though seemingly unsure of himself. “Isn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” the Exisal says. “He said earlier he had no idea a murder had even taken place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I still think we need to hear what he has to say,” Tsumugi says. “And then we can vanquish this culprit once and for all!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito mutters darkly under his breath, “the hell are you so excited for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spares him a quick glance, before turning her attention to Tsumugi’s conversation.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tsumugi says. “Please present your witness account of the night of the murder.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night…” Kiibo says. “I was not aware of what was happening for most of the night I believe, however, I encountered a power failure a bit after midnight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you please clarify the time,” Tsumugi presses.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My internal clock states it began at twelve-forty,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s the time of Kokichi’s death,” Tenko says softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “We don’t know exactly when he died. There’s a two hour window in the Monokuma File for some goddamn reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Two hours…” Kiibo repeats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Witness,” Tsumugi says. “Does that mean anything to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” the Exisal says. “He just said he was dysfunctional at that time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-It’s not time for your cross-examination yet,” Tsumugi protests.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Power failure…” Kaede says. “Hey, Kiibo, you said you thought you just overloaded yourself or something, right, but… is there any chance something else forced you to turn off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses. “I suppose that is a possibility. I admit I only assumed the cause because I could find no internal defects.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you were also out of commission for this entire weird two hour window we have for Kokichi’s death?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is also true,” he concedes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, then,” Kaede says. “Tenko, Tsumugi, when you were investigating the hanger, you saw used electrohammers, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Yes. Do you think someone used one on Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe but… Kiibo, you were forcibly turned off for exactly two hours last night?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Correct.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends a weighing look towards the Exisal, but it remains silent. “Then I think I know what happened. Assuming… Tenko, you didn’t happen to see anything that looked sort of like a bright pink grenade in the hanger this morning did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “Tenko didn’t. What about you, Tsumugi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t notice anything like that either,” Tsumugi says. “And a pink grenade? I think that probably would have caught my attention.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Grenades…” Ryoma says. “Kaede, you mentioned something like that a while ago when we were talking about fighting Monokuma, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I did. And those grenades were EMPs that last exactly two hours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Two hours?” Kaito asks. “Wait. Was one of those used and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it took Kiibo offline!” Tsumugi exclaims in her excitement. “A-And that’s also why—” then she pales, cutting herself off abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi?” Tenko asks. “Are you okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I,” she stammers. “I’m fine. I was just… thinking about something…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Thinking about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hang on,” Kaito says. “These grenade things or whatever that turns stuff off—Ryoma, you mentioned all the cameras and crap are little robot bugs—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Robot bears,” Monokuma interrupts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito says. “Robot bugs that are watching us all the time. Would one of those EMPs affect them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pauses for a moment, thinking. “If it did…” he says slowly. “Then Monokuma couldn’t monitor what was happening in the hanger for two hours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“During which Kokichi died. Wait,” Kaede says, the sudden realization hitting her. “Does that mean we don’t have an exact time of death because—does the mastermind not know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-What?” Monokuma says, sweating profusely. “O-Of course I know when the little brat died! It’s my job as—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then tell us,” the Exisal says. “Knowing the time of death is necessary for a fair trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up at the Exisal, lost for a moment before it dawns on her. This is a challenge. She whips her head to look at Monokuma, pausing on his throne. “You know,” he says finally. “I think it’s time we move on to a different subject, kids. So how about we talk about the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito barks. “Tell us the truth—do you know what happened to Kokichi or not!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Know? Of course I know!” Monokuma exclaims. “Last night he was smashed to bits! Dead, done, gone forever and ever and ever! What more do you need to know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says. “Tenko doesn’t want to agree with him, but… does the exact time of death matter? It says Kokichi died that night, and Tenko—she <i>thinks</i> that means the cameras turned back on after two hours and saw him dead…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “And we saw Maki this morning. Guess we found Monokuma covering his ass, but not sure if it changes anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I guess that’s true,” Tsumugi says, though still seeming unsettled.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps her gaze trained on the Exisal as the pieces start to come together before her again. It would be stupid to put her trust in them. She tears her eyes away. It would be stupid to trust someone like Maki. “Guys,” she says. “Think about it—wasn’t that weird?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What was weird?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tenko says, quickly looking down at him still in her hands. “Early this morning when we were all still in the dorms, we heard an Exisal outside and Maki was inside it. We talked to her and then she went back down to the hanger then we…” she glances up to the others for any guidance on how to continue. “We… talked for a while about what to do before following her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kiibo says. Then, “what about that is strange?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we talked to Maki in the Exisal,” Kaede says. “She opened the hatch the pilot’s seat for some reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” Kaito says. “We had to talk to her and shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she can talk to us through the mic,” Tsumugi gasps. “So did she just open it to prove it was her or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That’s what I’m beginning to suspect.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why would Maki need to do something like that?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because of what Kiibo said,” Kaede says. “He says he suffered one blackout last night and he recovered just now from another one, and since you and Tsumugi didn’t see any of the EMPs when you were in the hanger—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But they also didn’t see Kiibo’s head,” the Exisal says. “Things have gone missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo softly murmurs in confusion, “my head?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “No, I know I’m right. Kiibo, how long did your blackout before the trial last?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe I suffered my second malfunction approximately… a little over two hours ago,” Kiibo says. “It was,” he pauses, the same connection Kaede made coming to him. “The same as the first one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How many EMPs were there?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just two, right?” Tsumugi says. “So does that mean one was used last night and another was used this morning to disable Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rubs the back of his head. “Okay, yeah, I guess. But what does any of that mean? Maki wanted us to know she was in the Exisal so she could shut off Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think Kiibo being there was a complete coincidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” Tsumugi says. “Did you figure something out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to look at her hanging on to her every word. “Yeah… yeah I did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re so close to figuring out this mystery,” Tsumugi says. “Kaede, you can do it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Kaede says. “Thank you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can we focus?” Kaito asks. “You said it was weird Maki talked to us—what do you mean by that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko does think it was a little strange she would stop to speak to us,” Tenko says. “And that she opened the hatch to the cockpit then but not now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If she opened it in the trial, she couldn’t have pulled her Kiibo trick,” Ryoma says. “Why… did she pull her Kiibo trick anyway?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that why she disabled me this morning?” Kiibo asks. “In order to impersonate me at the trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if that was Maki’s goal,” Tenko says. “Why did she wait to start pretending to be Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe there was another reason for using the EMP,” Ryoma says. “Maybe she wanted to trip Monokuma up on something again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito mumbles, “she wanted to hide something from Monokuma…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if that’s the case,” the Exisal said. “Then maybe it should remain hidden.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We never saw Maki after we went to the hanger that morning,” Kaede says. “And this entire trial whoever is inside that Exisal has been trying to hide their identity this entire time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kaito says. “What are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have a question,” the Exisal says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Tsumugi points an unsteady finger at it. “You’re just trying to stop us! Nothing good can come from answering your question!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” the Exisal says. “But I think I’ll still ask it. Last night in the hanger, Kokichi and Kaede were together and Kaito and Maki were together. Then the alarm turned off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “Yes…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito scowls. “What does that have to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who turned off the alarm?” it asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room goes quiet. Kaede finds herself at a loss. “I,” she begins. “Don’t know. I was with Kokichi the whole time, and I just… never thought about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you trying to imply there was someone else in the hanger that night?” Kaito asks. “‘Cause it wasn’t me or Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma and I were together when… all of that was happening, I think,” Tsumugi says. “And Tenko was unconscious in the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kiibo’s a thumb drive,” Kaito says. “That’s literally everyone so what the fuck are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal pauses for a moment, then, “who would have the ability to turn off the alarm?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will you just tell us what the hell you mean already?” Kaito snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi had the remote to the hanger, but Kaede said he had nothing to do with it,” the Exisal continues. “So who else could have done it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with the brim of her hat as she thinks. “Just… Monokuma’s the only one who knows the password.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” the Exisal says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns slightly to look at the now sweating robot bear. “Did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well,” Monokuma says. “It was just sooo loud and I was just trying to get my beauty sleep, and it is my responsibility to shut off the alarm so it doesn’t blare forever. And let me tell you just what a pain my b—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You interfered with a murder,” the Exisal says. “And that breaks one of your rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that true…” Tenko murmurs softly. “What happens then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ahem, well, excuse me for wanting a little peace and quiet!” Monokuma says. “And as you know, a murder had not yet occurred at that point—just some riffraff and spats that were far too loud for my delicate ears.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For your ears,” the Exisal says. “Or your audiences’?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede snaps to look at the Exisal as any doubts in her mind evaporate into nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Audience?” Monokuma asks, tilting his head. “Are you by any chance referring to my tragically deceased kubs? To mock a grieving father! Oh the humanity! The bear-manity!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Knock it off,” Ryoma says. “Tell us what they’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would if I could, but my head is only full of fluff,” Monokuma replies. “Poor little old me, surrounded by such wild and imaginative children. Whatever is a bear to do besides kill them all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anything besides that,” the Exisal says. “You won’t end your game that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma raises a paw, his red eye glowing. “Phuhuhu—feel like testing me on that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” the Exisal says. “I’ve done what I needed to do. Kaede, you had something to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks up at it, completely caught off guard. “I—you want me to keep going?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want you to think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps staring at it. Distantly, Kaito asks her if she knows something, the emotional strain clear in his voice. Tsumugi asks if she’s figured something out and if she’ll please tell everyone else. The Exisal doesn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her thoughts come racing faster. Maki wouldn’t do what Kaede knows she has to have done. She isn’t to be trusted. Neither of them are to be trusted. Kaede keeps thinking, the implications twisting themselves over and into knots.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Tsumugi speaks. “Wait a minute—I think I get it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You…” Kaede says. “You do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s plainly just a theory, but,” she says. “Is there any chance that Maki and Kokichi switched places this morning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her jaw drop as Tsumugi makes the decision to press onwards for her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wouldn’t that mean the Monokuma File was wrong?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs. “I know it’s hard to believe, especially because we’ve relied on it so much in the past. But Kaede is right. Why else would the culprit of the trial try so hard to pretend to be so many different people? Why would Maki make sure we knew it was her when we first saw her this morning? Why would she wait before killing Kokichi that night?” She turns to Kaede. “Kaede, you see what I’m getting at, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And then Kaede feels herself freeze. “I…” she stares at Tsumugi looking so earnestly at her to continue. She doesn’t turn to see what the Exisal is doing, but she swears she can feel its cold stare on her, too. “I think—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have something to say,” the Exisal says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “You’re just going to try to confuse us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not just saying it for me,” Kokichi’s voice says, suddenly emanating from the Exisal. Then it switches to Rantaro. “If I can be dramatic for a moment, I need to say something for everyone who has died.” Then, Maki. “And I’m not going to take no for an answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(THEORY ARMAMENT)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“This killing game,” Maki says. “Has always been us against the mastermind—the killings are only distractions.”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Solving mysteries here,” Shuichi says. “That’s not really finding the truth. It’s just what the mastermind wants us to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“It is a show to them,” Kirumi says. “They give us a puzzle and we solve it to entertain their audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“And all that does,” Gonta says. “Is create more murders, and then more mysteries and more entertainment. And all of us…”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“We die for it,” Korekiyo says. “The trials are not held in order for us to survive but in order to perpetuate our suffering.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“There is no justice, there is no ‘hope’ in doing what Monokuma asks,” Kiibo says. “There is no beating him at him own game either. The only way to truly succeed…”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“Is to not play at all!” Angie says. “But it’s too hard to just stop the murders so the only other thing to do is to stop the mysteries!”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“If that happens,” Himiko says. “Then Monokuma’s audience won’t be happy, and if they’re not watching, why would we keep playing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“And you better take this advice seriously,” Miu says. “People have died over it, you know? Two people are dying over it right now.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“The only way to make sure their sacrifices aren’t in vain,” Kokichi says. “Is to stop here—not every truth needs to be revealed.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“And the truth I’m giving you, and the one you need to believe,” Rantaro says. “Is that Kokichi died that night and Maki killed him.”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1">“<b>And there is no other possibility</b>,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a moment, still staring up at the Exisal, taking it all in.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi, says, “Well, is that everything? Are you done?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one answers her question immediately and Tsumugi sighs. “I guess in that case—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says. “I think I understand what you were trying to say earlier about Maki and Kokichi potentially switching places.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks delighted, and Kaede doesn’t miss the semi-triumphant look she sends the Exisal. “Good. So I guess I wasn’t too far off, the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But I think your theory isn’t right,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What you’re getting at is that Maki and Kokichi made some sort of weird plan or something and Maki just agreed to let herself be killed, right?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says. “She’s the victim!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede shakes her head. “She can’t be. I get why Tsumugi thinks it’s a possibility, but, well,” she shrugs, “Kokichi was poisoned that night and we all know the antidote ended up broken in pieces on the floor. It’s impossible that he survived.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” Tsumugi looks at a complete loss. “I guess that is true…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was only the one antidote that Kaito brought,” Tenko says. “And if Kokichi was shot with poison…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito clenches his jaw. “There’s no way he would have lived.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but…” Tsumugi starts to say. “Um…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito did give me part of the antidote,” Kaede says. “So you didn’t need to drink all of it, but from what you described earlier, I doubt Kokichi ever got any of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi hugs one of her arms to herself but doesn’t say anything further. Ryoma says, “So is that everything then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks so,” Tenko says. “We argued for so long, but… the answer is still the same isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then did Maki impersonate me merely to throw suspicion off of herself?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Kaede says. “She could have tried to just make us have enough doubt to think up some weird theories instead of just looking at the problem in front of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I see,” Kiibo says. “So she was simply trying to get away to avoid execution.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “That can’t be it. Maki—she wouldn’t do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says softly. “She just did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just sighs. “I know. But it doesn’t seem right to me. Maki knew what she was doing—she wouldn’t just kill someone and let us take the fall. She wasn’t like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kaede says sternly. “Kokichi is dead because Maki killed him. Even if you want to believe in her, that’s just the facts of the situation. There’s no way Kokichi could have survived that poison.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘That poison…’” Tsumugi mutters to herself, suddenly creasing her brow in thought.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito doesn’t meet her gaze. “I know. I found the antidote, put it in Maki’s hand and watched her break it from the bathroom window—you don’t have to keep telling me over and over again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tsumugi says. “Actually, um, would you mind telling me a bit more about the antidote? I mean, I remember you reading part of the label aloud when you found it but… I-I think it could be useful to go over what it was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma frowns. “Does the poison used matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure,” Tsumugi says. “But I think it might.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches Tsumugi carefully, not quite sure what she’s trying to get at. “Tsumugi, I don’t think there were the same ingredients that were in the antidote just lying around in the hanger or anything like that. And even if there were, I doubt Kaito remembers exactly what they were.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no!” she says. “It’s nothing like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what is it?” Tenko asks politely.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “I was just thinking it might be useful to know what kind of poison it was since… there might be a second antidote that someone secured way before the murder. Actually, Kaede, I think you might know what I’m talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think I do,” Kaede says. “How could there have been…” and she feels the words die in her throat as the memory that only she and Tsumugi should know comes back to her. Kaede shakes her head, hoping she didn’t pause for long enough to alert Tsumugi of her discovery. “I’m sorry, Tsumugi, but I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” she says. “That’s too bad. Anyway, Kaito, what did the antidote label say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends him a look she hopes conveys the complex intricacies of the situation. Kaito only seems slightly off put by her pained expression but understands enough to give the vague answer, “a bunch of stuff about how to use it and how much to take mostly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi, for her part, doesn’t seem frustrated by his useless response. “Okay, but did the label say anything about what kind of poisons it commonly treats?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not su—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anything about poisons commonly slipped in food?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The color drains from Kaito’s face and the stutter in his answer does enough damage alone. “I—did I say something like that when I found it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “But Maki did when she took the antidote Kokichi had taken from Shuichi’s lab at dinner a few days ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but wince at the damning words. Ryoma asks, “don’t remember anything like that. When did this happen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, a while back when Kaede and I discovered Shuichi’s lab for the first time, Kokichi showed up and took an antidote and a poison with him,” Tsumugi says. “I don’t plainly have no idea what he was planning to do with it, but at dinner the night we finished exploring the new parts of the school, he started talking about it again, and Maki took the antidote from him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That night,” Tenko says. “Tenko was with Ryoma in the dorms…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kaito was in his room,” Tsumugi adds. “Kaede and I were the only people who saw it happen, but from Kaito’s reaction, I think I guessed right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grips the front of his podium with one hand, and Kaede notices the other darts to hold his side. “Okay,” Kaede says. “But just because Maki had an antidote doesn’t mean Kokichi ever took it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s right,” Kaito agrees, his voice breaking as he tries to hold back a cough. “Maybe that’s all true or whatever, but we don’t know if she had it with her when she went to the hanger. Besides, Maki destroyed the antidote I brought so she obviously didn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “She did that because she wanted to trick you into thinking Kokichi died that night, and we almost fell for it. But we know that before Maki went to the hanger, she specifically picked to use a poison that she knew there were two antidotes for—one that Monokuma had restocked on the shelf in Shuichi’s lab and the one she had taken from Kokichi previously.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth presses into a thin line as Tsumugi talks. “But,” she says. “We can’t know that for sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think we can,” Tsumugi insists. “I mean, why else would Maki go out of her way to choose that poison? She must have gone to the hanger with the goal in mind to try and pull some sort of trick like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “That can’t be right. ‘Cause that would mean… would mean she was planning to let herself be killed, and,” he grimaces, “M-Maki wouldn’t do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says. “Would Maki kill someone? Tenko knows that seems like a strange question, but, Kaito kept talking about how she promised him she wouldn’t…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stares at her in horror for a brief moment before turning away to cough into his hand. “N-No,” he still manages to get out. “I-I refuse to believe that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If all of this is true,” Ryoma says mostly to himself. “Then… Kokichi’s alive?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“K-Kokichi?” Kaito stammers. “He—no that’s not possible. He wouldn’t hurt anyone either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal remains silent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think maybe I should clear up everything,” Tsumugi says. “Because we’ve solved this case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I really don’t think that’s necessary, Tsumugi,” Kaede says quickly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it’s the only way to convince everyone,” she says. “Then it is. So first, a few days before the murder, the culprit of the case and Maki—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But we can’t know!” Kaede shouts. “All of this is just speculation! <i>Maybe</i> Maki decided to just let Kokichi kill her for some reason, or <i>maybe</i> it’s what we thought before and Maki still killed him with the knife or the poison or whatever else. We can’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” the Exisal finally says, Kokichi’s voice emanating from it this time. “Monokuma doesn’t know either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes widen. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The EMPs,” Maki says. “You were right. They disabled the mastermind’s cameras in the hanger. No one knows what happened—not even Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is… is that really true?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it is,” Ryoma says. “Then what happens with the trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to stare down Monokuma. “We can’t vote if you don’t know the answer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But strangely enough, unlike the times before, Monokuma doesn’t seem nervous. “Is that so? Because after your wonderful discussion, I think I have a pretty good idea how things went down.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kaede was right,” Tenko says. “We can’t know for sure, can we? So… how do we vote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma brings his paws to his mouth. “Like you always do. Vote for who you think is the blackened!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck you,” Kaito says. “You’re just trying to get us to sell out Maki or Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, that’s such a nasty way of putting it,” Monokuma says. “Especially since aren’t they the ones who betrayed you first when they set up an impossible mystery? After all, who’s going to suffer from a wrong vote? Who’s going to suffer from a resisted execution? Oh, and believe me, this trial isn’t ending without an execution.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat tighten even as she forces herself to speak. “You’re—you’re bluffing. As long as you don’t know what happened, you can’t rule if our vote is right or wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe we could try and tie the vote?” Tsumugi asks. “L-Like three of us vote for Kokichi and then three for Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not gonna happen,” Ryoma says. “Whichever of them is in the Exisal would have to leave in order to vote at all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But doesn’t that mean that if we even hold a vote, they’ll be punished anyway even if we are wrong?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, a clever plan, certainly had me sweating a few times,” Monokuma says. “But all’s well that ends well, and this situation is just so utterly, deliciously hopeless once again. Because like I said—this trial only ends with an execution for somebody.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That,” Kiibo says suddenly. “Might be alright…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito looks appalled. “Wha—What the hell are you saying!? How is that ‘alright!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I, ahem,” Kiibo says. “May or may not have a potential plan in place in the event of—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Puhuhuhu,” Monokuma laughs. “Oh, don’t worry your pretty little decapitated head about all that. Maybe the situation isn’t quite as taken care of as it should be thanks to a few good for nothing tech monkeys not doing their jobs, but accommodations have been made far in advance!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What are you talking about? It sounds like you have employ—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means whoever our culprit is will receive a lovely, unhackable, low-tech execution!” Monokuma announces. “Honestly, they knew what they were doing in the old days—some times you just gotta strip off the bells and whistles to find real despair, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What… does that mean?” Tenko asks cautiously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma brandishes a claw. “I’m glad you asked. It means there’s no escape for our culprit who thinks they’re just so clever. Let this be a lesson for all you kids: never try to outsmart a bear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Kaede says, feeling the desperation involuntarily creep into her voice. “You still don’t know who the culprit is. None of us do. You can’t punish us if you don’t know, and if they stay in the Exisal, they’re safe aren’t they?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, you kids are so cute, thinking I won’t smash one of my own Exisals to bits,” Monokuma says. “And also now might be a wonderful time to introduce the Monokuma tank! Or the Monokuma clone army! Or maybe the Monokuma fighter jet! Go online for more details about how you, too, can purchase one of these limited offer—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re just going to kill us then?” Tsumugi gasps. “O-Or destroy the trial room until the culprit comes out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Welp, it’s not the nicest solution, but a bear has to do what a bear needs to do!” Monokuma says. “And I’m not giving up until someone here gets executed. Because after all, maybe the vote will be wrong or right, but our mysterious culprit will have to make an appearance either way if they want to prove, oh, what was it? My game is a sham and I’m a failure or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels herself start to sweat. She looks to the Exisal, hoping it will have some possible solution. But it remains as silent as the others, all starting to look panicked as the reality of their situation sets in.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, “hey,” Kaito says. “Monokuma, I have a question for you. At Shuichi’s trial… Kaede was the culprit, but he took the execution for her. Can that happen again?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The Exisal speaks then, hissing in Kokichi’s voice, “Kaito, quit it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” Monokuma says. “Are you trying to make a deal with little old me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” it says again, this time as Maki. “He’s not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito turns to the Exisal. “Hey, I—I honestly have no idea who you are, but just let me protect you, okay? I don’t have a lot of time left, and if I have to die, doing it this way, well,” even with the blood on his face, he does his best to give the Exisal his most confident smile. “I think I’d be okay with that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko gasps. “You can’t—you can’t just do something like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will if Monokuma lets me,” he says. “Besides, like I said… I don’t know who the hell died, but either answer…” he shakes his head. “I don’t want to hear it. I don’t know and I don’t want to know. I know Maki or Kokichi… one of them is already dead, but if I can save the other,” he presses his fists together. “Then I’m going to. And dying not knowing who I failed—I think I’d prefer that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself at a loss to do anything that repeat his name. “Kaito…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, hmm,” Monokuma hums. “Interesting, very interesting…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaito says. “What do you think Monokuma? Everyone votes for me, I get executed, and you let the others go. You get your execution and the trial ends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “I can’t let you do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “It’s too late. I’ve already made up my mind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t understand,” she says. Then she pauses for just a moment before saying, “if I let you die, Harumaki-chan will kill me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s previously calm demeanor vanishes. “Ko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then the Exisal starts to lower itself to the ground, Maki’s voice still coming out of it all the way. “I had a feeling things would end like this. And I didn’t have too much of a choice anyway once you guys started piecing everything together even after my super dramatic speech and all.” The hatch rises, and Kaede can’t find it in herself to feel anything but defeat when she sees Kokichi inside. “Honestly, that should have given away that it was me. You think Harumaki-chan could pull something like that off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “The culprit was Kokichi after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it,” Kokichi grins, folding his hands behind his head. “I underestimated you guys. I thought you’d all be doomed for sure without me giving you hints. But looks like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the fuck are you doing!?” Kaito shouts in him. “Get the hell back in there right now! Monokuma’s gonna kill you!” Kokichi doesn’t move and Kaito shouts again. “What the hell are you waiting for!? Hurry up!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi looks at him, and while his expression remains upbeat, Kaede can’t help but think she sees something slightly sad in his smile, or at least, she’d like to think she does. “Kaito,” he says. “You’re very dumb and very sweet, and you know it’s too late for that to work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” he yells back. “No, it’s fucking not! There’s still time to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did someone say out of time?” Monokuma asks. “Because whoever did is right on the money! It’s now the wonderful and despair inducing voting time! Will you choose the right choice or the dreadfully—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck you!” Kaito shouts. “I’m not voting for shit!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope,” Kokichi says. “I appreciate the sentiment, but no can do, Kaito. Like I said, Harumaki-chan would not be happy if anything happens to you. That was part of our deal, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says softly, “so you two were working together, after all. Did Maki force you to do the plan or she wouldn’t give you the antidote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… a possibility,” Ryoma says, though seemingly more stunned than anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hums. “Could be. But anyway, your options are everyone votes for me or everyone decides not to vote, and, well,” he smiles wryly. “Option two isn’t going to happen. Not for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her stomach twist. “Kokichi…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care,” Kaito says. “I’m not—I’m not sending you to your death. I don’t care if I’m the only one. I’m not voting for anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sighs and finally jumps out of the Exisal’s cockpit to walk over to him. He places a comforting hand on Kaito’s arm and says, “Hey, Tenko,” he says. “Can you do me another favor?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko jolts slightly at the address but still answers, “Y-Yes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My podium’s next to yours so can you go ahead and vote for me?” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says. “You can’t be serious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What? Why not? I’m always serious,” Kokichi says. “And I’m especially serious about Tenko voting for me since I need to vote for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito manages to gasp, “Wha—” before Kokichi bodily shoves the bulk of meager weight into Kaito’s chest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He gasps again, staggering back with a choked cough, while Kokichi easily presses at the voting screen on his podium. “And there,” he says before looking up. Behind him, Kaito’s on his knees, trying to catch his breath as more coughs rack his body. “Anyone else still need to vote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces herself to tear her eyes away just long enough to press his name on her own panel. Tenko seems to do the same and immediately takes off to hurry to Kaito’s side. “Kaito,” she says. “Try to calm down. Just focus on breathing, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks up, blood still streaking down his chin, to glare at Kokichi. “F-Fuck you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi nonchalantly turns to face him as Monokuma announces all the votes are in. “It sounds like you're angry with me, Kaito. That's good,” he says. “And holding on to all that anger will make pressing the reset buttons on your feelings just a bit easier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind him, the tallies come in to show a unanimous vote. Despite Tenko’s protest, Kaito staggers to his feet, taking a shaky step towards Kokichi. “You—you killed Maki, and you faked your own death just so you could lie and manipulate us, and-and put me through hell,” he snarls. “And I’m never going to forgive you for any of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You shouldn’t,” Kokichi says. “In fact—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stops abruptly when Kaito surges forward to wrap his arms around his shoulders, pulling him into a tight hug. “And I’m so fucking happy you’re alive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi seems to recover from his initial surprise, though he doesn’t return the hug, his arms staying limply at his sides. But he doesn’t push Kaito away, either, and remains oddly quiet as the other slowly gather around. “Hey, Kaito,” he says finally. “I know you love me and all, but everyone’s kinda starting to stare.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito mumbles half heartedly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you know how hard that is for me,” Kokichi teases back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “Not to interrupt, but… Kokichi, can we ask you some questions?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Without moving an inch, Kokichi replies casually, “well, you know how much I love talking about myself, but I’m afraid that’s kind of up to Kaito right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses for a moment, letting a breath out through his nose before slowly backing off. “Ew,” Kokichi says, brushing at the top of his head. “Kaito got his gross blood on me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “You—you planned all of this with Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm?” he turns to look at her. “Did you say something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels just a touch of her sympathy drain as part of her remembers just how difficult talking to Kokichi is. “You and Maki worked together,” she says. “To try and end the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not a question, Kaede,” he says, cheerily folding his hands behind his head. “But it is true. Obviously didn’t work out though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well—but still,” Tsumugi says. “Maki she really did just… let herself be killed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“True,” Kokichi says. “I know I said you guys did a good job figuring me out, but you did slightly miss that part. Harumaki-chan went to the hanger with everything all set up, including a knife so she wouldn’t die by getting crushed to death or anything since that would be the worst—or at least, I think it’d be the worst.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… does not sound pleasant,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But yep!” he says. “When Harumaki-chan showed up, I figured out she had a plan pretty quick, and I was kinda dying to know what it was. Also could you imagine if things worked out differently and it was Kaede trying to pull something like this off?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “I hadn’t really thought about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you just gave up,” Ryoma says. “So… all of this was for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, who do you think you’re talking to?” Kokichi says. “Of course I haven’t given up—I just had to protect what was important. And besides ending a killing game by killing everyone is kind of a hollow victory, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees Kaito clench his hands into his fists while Tenko says, “You wanted to save us. You and Maki, both. You wanted to end the killing game and also save us from the time limit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m just the nicest guy, aren’t I?” Kokichi says. “You know, for a while I was kicking around plans about pretending to be the mastermind, but those all kinda fell apart so I was just stuck being a goody-two-shoes. Still, though, I know I’m not that well liked, so you guys should stop lying and pretending to be all sad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi ignores him. “Come on—you’re getting a pain like me out of your hair, but you’re all acting like someone ran over your cat or something. But then again, it was pretty fun to see how much everyone loved me after I was dead, so win some lose some.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How can you say that?” Tenko asks, near horrified.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “And also why did you do so much other weird stuff like get Kaito to bring you Kiibo’s head?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” he says. “That’s a really good question, Tsumugi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not going to answer are you…” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not unless you answer a question first!” Kokichi says before pouting and pointing towards his crossed out portrait across the courtroom. “Is that really the best picture Monokuma had of me? He didn’t even get my good side!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what you’re concerned about?” Tsumugi mumbles to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “Image is very important for a supreme leader. Well, at least Monokuma looks pretty stupid for declaring me dead even if he used an ugly picture.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears the bear in question begin to grumble darkly to himself. “But still, Kokichi,” she says. “Why did you set everything up to be so… weird? I know some things were to make us think Maki was the culprit, but a lot of other things were just kinda…” she finds herself trailing off, caught between trying to ask about the oddities of the case and why other parts seemed so needlessly cruel.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says. “I’ll admit this was never my best lie, but then again I had to work with Harumaki-chan’s stupid plan. I’d like to think I managed to salvage something not completely terrible from it, though.” He beams as he folds his hands behind his head. “I did keep you guys guessing for a while after all, didn’t I? You should have seen the looks on your faces—man, I should really fake my death more often.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s…” Kaede says. “That’s it—that’s all you have to say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He hums. “I mean, you guys figured out most of the important stuff, and, well, I just wouldn’t be being true to myself unless I took a few secrets to my grave, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Tenko says, shooting an anxious glance to Kaito. “Tenko thinks Kaede meant just… you’re going to die. Are you really not scared at all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi follows her gaze, and his voice lowers from his previous cheerful tone. “No,” he says. “Harumaki-chan and I both knew we were going to die as soon as we started our plan to end the killing game. She was super annoying about it, too, and kept asking me if I was sure I wanted to go through with it after she gave me the antidote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you weren’t coerced then?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup! That’s one thing you guys got wrong, so I really can only give you a ‘C’ plus or something,” Kokichi says. “Especially since you guys haven’t figured out the real twist of the plan yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-What?” Tsumugi stammers. “I thought you said it was just to have a mistrial? Was that just a lie, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi presses a finger to his lips. “This is a mistrial,” he says. “Because Monokuma still has no idea who killed Harumaki-chan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pales. “B-But you confessed, didn’t you? Isn’t that why you left the Exisal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “You… you haven’t given up trying to trick Monokuma, have you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins. “I won’t give up even after my death—when I play a game, I play to win after all. And, well, I think it’s pretty safe to say that I won even if I did need stinky Harumaki-chan’s help.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Kaito speaks up, voice hoarse. “Are you not the killer?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something in Kokichi’s smile falters for just a moment, and Kaede notices he seems to look somewhere to the side of Kaito when he speaks. “Afraid I can’t say, Kaito. Mostly, I just want to let Monokuma know that, sure, maybe it was me, but Harumaki-chan also could have used that knife before I crushed her body.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And because of the EMP,” Ryoma says. “Monokuma has no way to know what actually happened. That’s the other part of your plan, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly!” Kokichi says. “So, Monokuma, your thoughts?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to Monokuma to see his robotic eyes narrowed and tiny fists curled in rage. “Man,” Monokuma says. “Even at the end you’re still a stubborn jerk.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not an answer,” Kaede says. “Monokuma, do you know who killed Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He stares down at her, pausing for a moment. “The killer,” he says finally. “Is the killer, plain and simple, and if I say it’s Kokichi Oma, then it’s Kokichi Oma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you… don’t actually know, do you?” she persists.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma goes quiet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles. “And I think that means I win.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Win nothing!” Monokuma shouts. “All you’re winning is an execution!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sighs. “Man, two wrongful executions in one killing game? This game sucks…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s my name!” Kokichi beams. “Funny hearing you use it. Absence really does make the heart grow fonder and all that, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito ignores the teasing. “Maki—she… she really agreed to everything right? She…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She did,” Kokichi says, some of his cheer fading. “Me and her actually went back and forth a lot on who would do what, but she kept whining about this promise she made with you and how she wasn’t about to let you down and all that. So even if it was all pretend, she was pretty insistent on being the victim.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a shaky sigh. “Yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mhmm,” he says. “And trust me—I wouldn’t lie about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kaede’s surprise, Kaito seems to accept that answer. “Right… right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And she also wanted me to deliver a message to you, but I cut out a few parts since they were too mushy,” Kokichi says. “Basically Harumaki-chan told me to tell you not to blame yourself. Keeping Kaito safe was too important and she said a bunch of stuff about how she knows you hated that but she’s too stubborn to listen and you guys have that in common and blah blah blah.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that true?” Kaito asks. “Or are you… lying to make me feel better?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kokichi turns slightly to fish a piece of paper out of his pocket. “Have a note from assassin-chan right here! I also added some additions at the end, though you should read her part first to save the best for last.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito takes it, and something in his expression seems to crack as he breaths out, “you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that!” Monokuma announces. “Is enough of that! Sheesh, you kids can talk, but we got an execution to get to. And I’ve been really looking forward to this one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kokichi says. “Sounds like that’s my cue, and,” he gives a knowing grin to Monokuma, “I would hate to keep your audience waiting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m sure I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Monokuma replies.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s okay,” Kokichi says. “Because that was also a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaito says. “Quit messing around. You—you can still escape or…” he swallows. “You should have just let me—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi huffs. “And I keep telling you, that’s not an option, Kaito. Geeze, I’m literally dying and you still can’t listen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “Because I’m not gonna let you die. We can still fight Monokuma, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kokichi says. “You can’t. If it wasn’t a possibility when everyone was here to fight or when Miu had her remote, then why would it suddenly work now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I’m not giving up,” Kaito says. “I’m not just going to fail both you and Maki—I don’t care if I die, but I’m not just going to sit back and let my friend throw their life away.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi pauses then. His recovery comes fast, but Kaede notices that same familiar sadness she thought she saw when Kaito had first hugged him. “Geeze, Kaito, you keep ruining my cool and mysterious image with all your lame speeches,” he says. “And also you still can’t listen.” He sighs. “Well, I did come prepared to Kaito proof my execution.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s eyes widen. “You what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi slips a familiar looking bottle out of his pocket, and before Kaede can even process what it is, he unscrews the lid and downs whatever liquid was inside. “Ugh, blechy,” he says, wiping his mouth on the back of his sleeve.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Tenko says cautiously. “What did you just do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Drank lukewarm poison,” he says, sticking his tongue out. “That was so gross. I thought it was supposed to be flavorless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pales. “You—the poison you had been carrying around! You just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Spit it out!” Kaito shouts. “Hurry, throw it up or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Calm down,” Kokichi says. “And doing stuff like that would ruin the point. But, ugh,” he brings a hand to his forehead. “I’m already all dizzy. I guess at least it didn’t lie about being stronger in large doses.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How much time do you have?” Ryoma asks, obviously trying to keep his voice even.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not a lot,” Kokichi says. “Which means Monokuma-chan better hurry up if he wants to kill me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just stares in horror. “Kokichi, how could you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi suddenly jerks as he coughs into his hand, and the familiar image of blood on his hand and running from his mouth somehow makes him grin. “Hey, look, Kaito. We match.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sight is enough to make Monokuma scramble back to his chair to press his big red button to start the execution.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The last thing Kaede hears before it begins is Kaito calling, “Wait, Kokichi—!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then,</span></p>
<p class="p10"><span class="s1"></span><br></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>GAME OVER</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>KOKICHI OMA HAS BEEN FOUND GUILTY</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>TIME FOR THE PUNISHMENT</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><b>King of Lies: The New Burning of the Versailles Witch</b><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t resist as the stage starts to build itself around him, nor does he struggle as a sea of Monokuma like spectators emerge to separate him from the others. Up on his platform, Kaede realizes he’s leaning against a large wooden stake and the way back down has been replaced with piles and piles of branches. Even as Kokichi calmly keeps his hands folded in front of him, Kaede feels something sick rise up in her stomach.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi voices her thoughts aloud, mumbling to herself, “he’s going to be burned alive…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words set something off in Kaito, and Kaede only hears him say under his breath, “like hell he is,” before he takes off towards the crowd of Monokumas.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede only blinks as he runs past her, bodily pushing against each and every Monokuma slowing his progress. “Kaito!” Tenko calls out. “Kaito!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko keeps yelling for him to stop as she quickly follows through his roughly cleared trail towards Kokichi. The thought forces Kaede to tear her eyes away from Kaito—even as he shouts for Kokichi to hold on and that he’s coming—towards the pyre. Then she sees it: a masked Monokuma bearing a torch flickering bright red against the rather murky medieval inspired backdrop.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gasps, bringing her hands to cover her mouth in horror. Kaito starts shouting louder, pushing harder against the Monokumas daring to stand between him and Kokichi. And Kokichi seems oddly peaceful. At this distance, she can barely see a slight sheen of sweat beginning to manifest on his pale forehead, but what catches her attention more is the thin line of blood beginning to run from the corner of his mouth down his chin.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The flames keep rising closer and closer, and Kaede can barely force herself to look as Kaito finally reaches the base of Kokichi’s pyre now completely engulfed in fire.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">To Kokichi, the world slowly blurs with the poison running brightly through his system, and he looks down through the haze of smoke and fire when Kaito calls his name.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi!” he shouts. “Just hold on a little longer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words mean little to Kokichi as the slight blood running from his mouth grows and begins to stain his uniform as it drips off of him. The fires around him are raging stronger and stronger, but Kaito still tries to move closer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi hears him hiss once at drawing too near, but he keeps going even as Tenko screams that he’s hurting himself. She tries to pull him away, but he fights against her grip, and through the daze, Kokichi sees Kaito’s hand reaching out towards him even from so far away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In his poison addled mind, all Kokichi can think is that’s a nice last thing to see.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The flames barely begins to graze against the soles of his shoes when Kokichi closes his eyes and his hands held clasped in front of him droop down to his sides.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito keeps shouting, somehow becoming more desperate in his goal once Kokichi stops moving while Tenko tries her best to restrain him from attempting to climb through the fire. The crowds of Monokumas seem to dissipate all at once, and Kaede hears a few grumbled words of frustration about being deprived of a proper execution.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With them gone, any grandeur or showiness the execution had fades into nothing, and Kaede is left standing watching Kaito finally collapse, his chest heaving with coughs or sobs or a combination of both while Tenko frantically hovers over him. Kokichi’s still body goes up in flames, and the sick smell of burning flesh that Kaede remembers all to clearly from Shuichi’s execution rushes over her, making her stomach twist and her throat feel sour and rotten.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes her eyes off Kokichi’s body again to see Tenko trying to urgently get Kaito back onto his feet even as he refuses to cooperate with her, all the while chanting at him not to look. Kaede watches the miserable scene before her, sees the blood and the tears and the burns when Kaito finally lets Tenko act as his crutch. Tenko shouts to the others that they need to get back to the school so she can help him, and Kaede nods along numbly, allowing herself to be herded into the elevator with the others.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps watching Kaito even as he goes quiet—accepting his place to just hang off of Tenko. She remembers being so angry at him before the trial. Wanting to hurt him and show him he was wrong and rub it in his face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shudders when Tenko shifts slightly, and Kaede can’t tell if it’s from pain or an attempt to disguise another sob. Kaede can’t tell if it’s possible for her to feel anger anymore. She at least knows she doesn’t feel it at him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">No one protests the walk to the dorms, and the only speech directed towards hers is when Kiibo springs to life again, and Tenko seems slightly frazzled as she hands him to Kaede. “Please, could you take this? Tenko really needs to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives her a grateful smile. Kaito doesn’t say anything.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two disappear into Tenko’s room, and neither Ryoma nor Tsumugi seem inclined to start any conversation as Kaede heads back to her own room. Inside, she takes a deep breath before saying, “What is it, Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am sorry if I am interrupting anything, Kaede,” he says. “But I believe there is something I need to tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah?” she says, still distracted with the events of trial burning in her mind.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Last night I was finally able to execute the code I was unsure about,” Kiibo says. “And I am finally comfortable saying this aloud as I believe there is no longer anything Monokuma can do about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede’s attention a bit more as she stares down at him. “Really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After the loss of my body, but before her death,” he says. “Miu went to what I have learned from my file gathering is something called the ‘Mother Monokuma.’ From there, she set up everything I would need to remotely access the network at a later date, helped by the fact that as a monopad, I am already semi-connected to the school’s system.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “That sounds… good, I think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe it is,” Kiibo says. “And I also believe I am secured enough now that Monokuma cannot so easily remove me. With this, I think it could potentially be our key to ending the killing game. And…” he pauses. “From the data I have gathered, I also think I have discovered the identity of the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would you like to hear it?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, it’s okay,” Kaede says. “I think I already know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I wanted this chapter out earlier but then it turned into the longest chapter in this fic by far, haha. Anyway, this has been a fun chapter that I've definitely seen a lot of theories for including some people who figured me out almost immediately! But whether you predicted it right away or weren't thinking too much about specifics, I hope you enjoyed the chapter! Also to anyone wondering, Celeste's execution has always been one of my favorites, haha.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Next chapter is also going to be bonus chapter featuring the scenes Kaede would have gotten if she had certain items, and I am also going to take that opportunity to link as much of the wonderful fan art I have gotten as I can! I have quite a few links collected already, but if I don't have yours, please just let me know in a comment on either this chapter or the next one since I would love to share it!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Silver Earring, Chapter One</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, Kaede,” Rantaro says. “What do you have there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede snaps her head up to see him looking over her shoulder, though at enough of a distance so as not to loom over her. He’s very aware of himself, she thinks. She thinks it again as she turns to address him and makes note of the careful styling of his hair, the plethora of rings clinking together on his fingers, and the piercings running along the shell of his ear. “Oh just,” she holds up the small silver hoops in her hand. “I got these from the Monomono Machine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Rantaro says, gently taking them from her. “These look like they’re pretty nice quality, actually, but Kaede,” he tilts his head slightly to get a better look at her. “You don’t have pierced ears, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah, I always thought it would be too much upkeep, especially on days where I could barely pull myself away from the piano long enough to eat,” Kaede says with a laugh. “Do you want them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His smile is serene but focused somehow. “Sure, though I don’t think I would feel comfortable taking them from you without giving you something in return.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, that’s really okay,” Kaede says. “I mean, I’m only giving it to you because I don’t want it. It’s not really an ‘out of the kindness of my heart’ thing or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro laughs. “Well, I managed to pick up some stuff earlier that I’ve been meaning to find a good home for, too. So really you’d be doing me a favor. I mean,” he pauses, his posture becoming lax as if to seem as unthreatening as possible. “Only if you want that is—I don’t want to be pushy or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, you’re not—don’t worry about that,” Kaede says. “And, well,” she shrugs. “I guess it couldn’t hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds good,” he says. “If you meet me outside the dorms near the arbor a little later, I think I might have some stuff together by then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “Okay—I’ll see you there!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro is exactly where he said he would be when Kaede leaves the school a little later. As she approaches, she sees a variety of impressively shiny jewelry sitting out before him. A few of the others walking past her seem to spy him, too, though they keep walking with little more than exchanged whispers and obviously curious glances.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When Rantaro notices her, he waves her over nonchalantly, seeming unaware of the spectacle he’s making of himself. Kaede, however, can’t help but feel a bit self-conscious as she hurries the last few steps towards him. “I didn’t keep you waiting too long, did I?” she asks</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “No, not at all. Anyway,” he looks back at his collection stewn over the table. “I had a lot of extra stuff in my room. I guess they’re for if I lost the ones I’m wearing right now, but,” he shrugs. “It’s fine if that happens.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tears her eyes away from a rather pretty jade necklace to look back at him. “You don’t care? But aren’t they yours?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Rantaro says. “I think that’s kind of hard to say. I’m… not exactly sure if I’m a jewelry kind of person actually.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not sure?” Kaede asks. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro laughs off her concerned tone, quickly waving his hands in surrender. “Oh, no—don’t mind me. I’m not quite sure what I meant either. Don’t worry about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at him, not bothering to hide her suspicious expression when Rantaro seems to spot something over her shoulder. “Oh,” he says. “Shuichi, are you waiting for Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips around to see Shuichi standing a few paces back, his hands flying to fidget with his hat. She feels her smile grow naturally to try and reflect enough comfort to stop him from running away. “Hey, that’s right—didn’t you want to tell me something earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, um, yes,” Shuichi says. “But it’s fine if you’re busy right now. I wouldn’t want to interrupt—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Come here—Rantaro was just showing me his jewelry. He was gonna trade me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Shuichi’s attention enough to draw him a few steps closer. “‘Trade you?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede found some earrings she thought I might like,” Rantaro says. “I said I’d only take them in a fair deal but now…” he tilts his head back to his possessions. “I think I might just want to give all of this away anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “Really? Well, you can’t give it all to me. I barely wear jewelry as it is. Shuichi, you have to take some, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“O-Oh, I couldn’t possibly—”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Come on! He just said he wanted to give it away,” Kaede pushes. “It’d be rude to say no.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi shifts slightly. “Kaede, I don’t really wear stuff like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you could start!” she presses. “Rantaro, what do you think would be a good look for Shuichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro just laughs as Shuichi stares at him like a deer caught in a pair of headlights. “I’m not really a stylist, but let me see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He approaches Shuichi, silently asking permission to examine him that Shuichi grants with a meek nod. As Rantaro ducks his head slightly to get a better view of Shuichi’s face from under his hat, Kaede says, “Not really a stylist? But you’re like one of the most stylish people here. I’m sure Shuichi would look super cute if you gave him a makeover.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Shuichi’s attention, and he snaps his head to look at Kaede, face flushed. “A-Kaede, you can’t just say things like that…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Rantaro says. “What if I do a terrible job?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I’m concerned about…” Shuichi mumbles to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You won’t,” Kaede says, oblivious to Shuichi’s distress. “And you’ll never know if you don’t try, right? Okay, I’ll wait right here and you can take him back to your room and show me when you’re done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Shuichi says. “What are you volunteering me for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro just laughs. “Well, if Shuichi’s okay with it, but I’m telling you you’re going to be disappointed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I won’t,” Kaede says. “Just give him a look that will make him feel super confident! And maybe you’ll discover that your real talent was Ultimate Stylist all along.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi pauses, seeming to understand her intentions all at once. “Ah, Kaede…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro’s smile grows just a bit sad all of a sudden. “I’m still not sure about that, but,” he shakes his head and whatever melancholy that was drawing over him vanishes. “Anyway, Shuichi, don’t get too mad at me if it turns out bad, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He grabs Shuichi’s hand, and the other boy’s eyes widen as he remembers exactly what is happening again. He stammers a few words of hesitation that get drowned out by Kaede happily telling them to hurry back soon.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When they do return, Kaede applauds the rather minute changes made to Shuichi’s appearance while Rantaro only smiles somewhat distantly. “I’m glad you like it, Kaede, though I don’t think I did much.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head before reaching out to clasp Shuichi’s hands. “Are you kidding? You did a great job! Don’t you think so, too, Shuichi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yeah,” he says, eyes not straying from where Kaede’s hands touch his. “Rantaro really knows his stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re both very kind, but you don’t need to flatter me,” Rantaro says. “Anyway, Kaede, is it alright if I just pawn all this stuff off on you? I kind of…” he has a strange far away look in his eyes as he says, “need to be somewhere else right now…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, okay?” Kaede says. “Where are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s no problem, Rantaro,” Shuichi says. “We’ll take care of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Rantaro nods gratefully and leaves them with little more than a polite goodbye. As soon as he’s out of hearing range, Kaede says, “did he say something to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not really anything in particular,” Shuichi says. “But… I think Rantaro is the kind of person who needs time to himself sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess,” Kaede says, not entirely happy with his response. “I hope he’s okay. I just don’t think anything good can come from running off and doing stuff all on your own without confiding in anyone, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi smiles softly. “I think so, but some people have a harder time asking for help than others.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s stupid,” Kaede says. “If you need something, you should be able to rely on the people around you. Like if you ever needed something, you’d come to me, right? Because I’m definitely going to rely on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“W-Well, I’m really not that reliable—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shuichi,” Kaede says. “That’ll only be true if you keep saying that about yourself over and over again. And I already said I’m going to be counting on you, so you better not let me down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll try not to,” Shuichi says, smiling slightly at the encouragement.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You definitely won’t,” Kaede says. “Especially with your new super confident super sexy look, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“With my new—” Shuichi’s face flushes. “A-Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede claps her hands. “Now come on! Tell me everything that Rantaro did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi stammers his first few words, trying to collect himself enough to entertain Kaede’s encouraging questions for the rest of the strangely bright afternoon.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Stainless Tray, Chapter Two</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kirumi says, addressing him from across the breakfast table. “Would you mind assisting me in carrying these last few cups into the kitchen?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo beams happily as he gathers as many empty mugs into his arms as he can, all clinking together loudly as he does so. “Of course, Kirumi!” he says, completely unaware of the concern on her face as the cups balance precariously in his grip. “Is there anything else you would like me to take while I’m here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, just those are fine for now,” she says. “It’s better to do many short trips rather than risk breaking something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo nods sagely at her words. “I see—I will make a note of that for the future.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please do,” Kirumi says. “It would be different if we had a dinner cart or a tray, but for now we will simply make do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though most of the other students had already cleared out, from her place still at the table, Kaede says, “actually, I think I picked up something like a tray a few days ago. I didn’t have any plans to use it for anything, so you can have it if you want, Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” Kiibo says. “May I practice with it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Kirumi cuts in. “Perhaps ‘practice’ is the keyword there. While it is simple to use, practice with composure and balance is necessary first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, I suppose that does make sense,” Kiibo says, though Kaede can’t help but detect a not of disappointment in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” she says. “Is there a place where Kiibo could practice?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi pauses for a moment before saying, “actually I believe there is. My lab recently opened, and it did seem to be exactly made for such things. Kiibo,” she says. “Would you like to practice my maid duties with me there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His eyes practically gleam as he answers. “Of course, Kirumi. I would be honored to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She smiles gently at his response before turning to Kaede. “Kaede, would you like to come as well? If Kiibo is to practice serving people, he should have live guests to make the experience worthwhile.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, sure,” Kaede says. “But it’d be a little awkward if I was the only person there…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi nods. “I see. If you request it, then I shall find other guests to attend as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, that sounds nice,” Kaede says. “So I guess it’s a request then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Very well,” she says. “I will come to get you later when everything is prepared.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi remained true to her word, and only a little later Kaede found herself being escorted through the school to her lab.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Inside, Tsumugi, Korekiyo, and Gonta were already seated around the elegant table. However, none of them pay much interest to Kaede entering, instead focusing on Kiibo balancing an exceptionally full and exceptionally wobbly tray in each hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi rushes forward to help him, saying in one breath, “Kaede please take a seat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With the trays secure enough in Kirumi’s hand, Kaede then gains the attention of the others as she slips into the chair next to Korekiyo. “Ah, right, thank you,” she says. “Is this everyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi nods. “I invited everyone who I believed would enjoy such an event.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kirumi told me we were going to be having a tea party,” Tsumugi says. “And, well, I’ve kind of plainly always wanted to try milk tea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Milk tea?’” Gonta asks. “But Tsumugi had milk in her tea this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, no,” she shakes her head. “It’s different. It’s like the milk is in the tea the entire time you make it. At least I think that’s right. Kirumi said she knew how to make it at least, so I trust her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo nods. “That appears logical, however, I believe Kiibo will be handling most aspects of our service as this is his ‘training’ after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, right…” Tsumugi says, the enthusiasm draining out of her voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I will do a fine job!” Kiibo says, catching word of their conversation. “There is no need to worry, Tsumugi!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I assume Kirumi will also be at his side every step of the way,” Korekiyo says. “It is truly interesting to observe the act of teaching. Seeing how one does not only demonstrate their skills but rather compartmentalizes them in order to explain to another person does wonders for examining how one views the aspects of their own work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, wow,” Kaede says. “I guess you’re right, but I never really thought of it that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yes—while many can certainly become skilled at their own profession that does not necessarily equate to them being adept at teaching it to another. For instance, Kaede, if you were to teach someone to play the piano, where would you begin? Posture? Reading music? Perhaps instrument care or even its history?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s actually a really good point,” Kaede says. “I guess I’d have to think it over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Gonta sees!” Gonta exclaims, tripping over his words in his excitement. “So Gonta should find a good teacher if he wants to be a gentleman?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would advise it, yes,” Korekiyo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You could probably ask Kirumi,” Tsumugi says. “When she’s not helping Kiibo, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At her words, Kirumi sweeps towards them, skillfully laying down delicate looking china cups before each of them as if it was second nature. “I could attempt it,” she says. “However, if you would like a professional as Korekiyo suggested, then I must warn you my talents primarily lie in service rather than manners specifically. Though if it is a request, I will do any necessary research beforehand to ensure I can assist to the best of my abilities.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Gonta says. “That sounds like a lot of work. Gonta doesn’t know if he can ask that of Kirumi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do not worry yourself over me,” Kirumi says. “I assure you it would be no trouble. If you would like to request my serv—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She cuts herself off at rather loud clatter of a large covered serving tray falling to the ground followed by Kiibo saying, “oh no! Stop!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kirumi looks over the table seemingly undisturbed by the tiny sandwiches now decorating the floor of her lab. “I will be back shortly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As she hurries away, Kaede says, “Well, Gonta, if you really want a teacher, then there’s probably someone else you could talk to besides Kirumi. Like… Korekiyo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Korekiyo’s eyebrows rise at the suggestion. “Me? I must say, I do not believe I have ever considered myself a gentleman.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really? Why not?” Kaede asks. “You’re always calm and talk really maturely. Also if you know about customs and manners in a whole bunch of cultures, you could probably teach Gonta a thing or two about etiquette.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pauses, and Kaede thinks she sees amusement flickering in his eyes. “Perhaps. Though I still doubt I would qualify as a gentleman.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi asks. “Why is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Korekiyo says. “While it is true that I have learned about the proper social customs in many places I have visited, and could likely impart them to someone else… I have been neglecting other responsibilities in my life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like what?” Gonta asks. “Does Korekiyo need help with something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In a manner of speaking, yes,” Korekiyo says. “However, I am afraid I could not ask for your help, Gonta.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems crestfallen as he asks, “Gonta can’t help?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “While you are very kind and brave, you are not the kind of person I am looking for. Please do not take it personally.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta will not,” he says. “But Korekiyo is looking for a person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” Korekiyo says. “Specifically, I am looking for those who could be friends with my sister, however, I believe she would only get along with young women.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, like me and Tsumugi?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks she can see the fabric of his mask twitch to indicate a smile. “Exactly. The two of you and Kirumi as well, I believe are the exact kind of friends my sister would be delighted to meet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smile back at his praise. “Well, if that’s the case, then I don’t think either of us would mind doing something like that once we got out of here. Right, Tsumugi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She looks across the table to see Tsumugi’s gone a few shades paler. “Tsumugi?” Kiibo says, suddenly appearing behind her, armed with a new covered tray. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Huh?” she stutters. “Y-Yes, I’m fine. I was just… spacing out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you are feeling ill,” Korekiyo says. “Perhaps someone could escort you to your room. I personally would not mind taking a brief break from our tea party to assist you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No, no! That’s fine!” Tsumugi says hurriedly. “After all, I’m still waiting for my milk tea.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs nervously, and Kaede can’t help but feel like she missed something even as the rest of their afternoon goes on in relative peace with the exception of a few dropped tea cups.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Home Planet, Chapter Two</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lies down on his back and points to the stars shining through the cage after training. “You know,” he says. “I was thinking the other day that it’d be nice to just sleep under the stars one night.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sits beside him, knees pulled to her chest. “Wouldn’t that be kind of dangerous, though?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” he says. “I trust everyone here. And besides, I could probably take ‘em even if someone did try something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko rolls her eyes. “Typical male overconfidence. Tenko bets you wouldn’t even wakeup and that you snore, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kaito says. “I’d totally wakeup!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you do snore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So?” Kaito says. “What does that have to do with anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>Anyway</i>,” Kaede says. “If you could, I guess it would be fun, but I wouldn’t really know. When I was a kid, my parents wouldn’t even let me sleep outside in a tent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “God, when I was a kid I probably killed my grandpa’s back making him sleep on the ground with me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why would you torture your poor grandfather like that?” Tenko gasps.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It was him or my grandma,” he says. “I never really knew my parents.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tenko says. “Tenko is sorry. She didn’t know…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just laughs again. “Don’t worry about it, but, man, if I knew saying that was all it would take to get you to like me—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko takes it back!” she says. “Kaito is still terrible!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, calm down—just a little joke,” he says, still smiling brightly. “But, man, now I’m getting all nostalgic. I remember I kept whining about not being able to go outside when it rained, so my grandma got me this, like, tiny home planet system thing that would project stars on the ceiling in my room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, ‘home planet?’” Kaede says. “Is it like a little ball thing with a bunch of lights? I think I picked up something like that a little while ago, actually.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sits up on his elbows, new excitement in his eyes. “Oh shit, really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says, shifting to grab it from her backpack. “This right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito takes in gingerly, turning it over in his hands a few times. “Yeah. Oh, this is great. You know, we should totally set this up in the gym tomorrow so everyone can see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The ceiling there is pretty high, though,” Kaede says. “I don’t know if one this small could really be anything impressive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though careful to keep her distance, Tenko leans slightly towards Kaito to get a better look. “Maybe Miu would be able to make something to help boost the power?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s eyes light up as he jumps to his feet. “Tenko, you’re a genius! Hey, Miu’s probably still in her lab, right? I’m gonna get her to make something right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Tenko says. “You should not bother Miu with—hey! Tenko is still talking to you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shouts the last part as he already takes off running with childlike enthusiasm. Kaede pats Tenko’s shoulder. “Just leave him be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko huffs. “Boys never listen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “If Miu decides to say no and just swear at him until he leaves, then he might have to learn.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The next morning, Kaede learns just how inaccurate her prediction was as Miu cackles when she announces, “guess which girl genius inventor just single handedly made your miserable lives just a little less pathetic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaito shouts. “It was my idea!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hair over her shoulder. “And I got the idiot to lick my boots when he begged me to do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut the fuck up! That didn’t happen!” Kaito says. “A-And I’m not an idiot!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No fair,” Kokichi says. “If Kaito’s going to lick anyone’s boots it should be mine! After all, he did agree to be my underling last night!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That didn’t fucking happen either!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just rolls her eyes as she turns to Kaito. “So, Miu agreed to make something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” he beams. “And it’s all ready to go as soon as you guys are ready! We’re gonna set up in the gym after breakfast.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, ooh!” Kokichi says. “I wanna go! I wanna see the dumb thing Miu and Kaito made!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not invited,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Miu chimes in. “No fucking dumpster babies allowed!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Kokichi begins to sniffle, Tenko turns excitedly to a half asleep Himiko. “Himiko, would you like to come, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” she says. “Are Kaito and Miu putting on a magic show?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “But Miu made something to make stars glow on the ceiling in the gym.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it’s magic,” Himiko concludes. “I dunno. I’ll have to think it over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks you should come,” she says. “Even if some terrible boys will be there, Tenko doesn’t think there’s anything m-more romantic than looking out at the stars with someone, and since Himiko always goes to bed early—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Looking out at the stars?’” Angie chimes, suddenly appearing behind Himiko. “Ooh, that sounds super inspirational to Angie! Maybe it would inspire God, too!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Himiko says. “And if that happens, you’ll make a new painting, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Angie clasps her hands. “Right! Right! God says the stars are positively divine! They might be so divine that they could help Himiko with her magic!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In that case, I guess I could go,” Himiko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko is happy to hear that!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just smiles and shakes her head as she hears her friends clamor over those who invited themselves along.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When Kaede makes it to the gym, she sees everyone who agreed to come is already there, and that the small home planet system she had given to Kaito the night before has been thoroughly transformed into a mammoth of a machine. Miu flings an arm out to the side to present it, accompanied by her introduction of, “listen up motherfuckers: this here is the work of the one, the only, archangel Miu Iru—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo! Hurry up!” Kokichi shouts from the small assembled crowd. “We didn’t come here to hear you run your gross mouth, you filthy pig!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu turns pink. “F-Filthy p-pig?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito runs a hand over his face. “You just had to do that, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just giggles as Tenko scolds him for speaking to Miu that way. Kaede sighs, “Miu, are you ready to start?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah, just hold your tits for a sec,” she says, recovering quickly as she becomes to adjust the rather complex looking controls. “And someone hit the fucking lights.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Angie’s got it!” Angie says, happily skipping over to do just that.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They’re in darkness just long enough for Kaito to curse at Kokichi for ‘accidentally’ stepping on his foot when splatters of blue and white and purple and yellow and red and every color in between shine in bright arcs above them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede finds herself awestruck. “Oh, wow…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She identifies the shapes as galaxies or stars or other astronomical phenomena she’s not familiar with even as Kaito eagerly names each and every pattern appearing. They spin slowly, occasionally changing to show some new picture of the night sky.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s the andromeda galaxy,” she hears Kaito say. “And that’s a close up of the Orion Nebula, and that’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, I didn’t know I had my own nebula,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Orion Nebula, dummy,” Kaito says. “It’s a stellar nursery—a place where stars are formed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I see, so it does belong to me!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t own space, asshole.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi grins up at him. “Just watch me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles as she instead switches to tune into Himiko saying, “yup. Definitely magic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh no, Himiko,” Angie says. “God told Angie that he made everything, and he made it especially beautiful to inspire us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He really did all that?” Himiko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup!” she answers. “And he also did it to light our way at night! In Angie’s village, we’d celebrate the stars and thank God for giving us such a wonderful world!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh, that sounds like a pretty nice God,” Himiko says. “Though I still think at least part of it’s magic.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, maybe, maybe!” Angie agrees easily.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks it’s nice,” Tenko cuts in. “When Tenko was in training and she’d get upset, sometimes her master would tell her to look at the sky and think how big the world is. And also to remember that it’s all connected through neo-aikido!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko turns to her. “Stars are connected to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hell yeah, they are!” Kaito chimes in. “Everything in the universe is made up of the same atoms, so like if you go way, way back before the earth existed all your atoms were probably a bunch of space junk!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says. “We’re technically made of stars? Kinda?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” he says brightly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And when you die,” Angie says. “God says you go back to the stars to be with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko isn’t sure about all that,” Tenko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko just stares up, seemingly transfixed by the shifting patterns. “I dunno. That sounds pretty nice… just bein’ a star forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Himiko…” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, not forever,” Kaito says. “I mean, maybe if you’re a red dwarf, but if you’re a red giant or something, then you’ll probably blow up after—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito!” Tenko says. “Do not ruin Himiko’s dreams!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not ruining shit! It’s just science!” he protests, pointing at another vibrant pattern. “Look—that’s what I’m talking about. That’s a supernova.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boom!” Kokichi cheers. “Explosion! Himiko will be gone in seconds!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yay! Kaito agreed with me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait! No, I didn’t!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, you did!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Both of you stop tormenting Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a step away from the three arguing to hear Himiko softly asking Angie, “hey, Angie, can you ask God if everyone who died went to space with him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course, of course,” Angie says. “But Angie doesn’t even need to ask. She’s prayed super hard, so she knows that Shuichi and Rantaro are definitely with God now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s good,” Himiko says. “So I guess we don’t need to worry about them…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nope! God said he’d take care of them,” Angie says. “Kaede, did you hear that? Everything will be okay for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede jolts slightly at the address. “A-Ah yeah, I’m,” she takes a deep breath to steady herself. The ceiling shifts again to what Kaede remembers Kaito had said was a place where stars were born. “I’m glad to hear that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh-huh,” Angie says. “So God says you don’t have to be so sad anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen at the comment, then she hears Tenko’s voice behind her, “That’s really nice, Angie, but Kaede should express her emotions how she needs to, even if your God is… doing things. Tenko thinks it’s okay to be upset when you lose someone, even if it couldn’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to look back at her, seeing that Kokichi seems to have dragged Kaito off to some other part of the gym leaving the girls alone. “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, I dunno,” Himiko hums. “If what Kaito was saying earlier was true and magic just keeps us altogether, do people ever just disappear? Well, unless,” she shifts her hat, “they use more magic to disappear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just smiles down at her as both Tenko and Angie eagerly agree. Then she hears Miu shout, “Alright bitches! Enough moping around!” Kaede glances back at her to see Kirumi now by her side. “Frigid Mc-no-tits over here rounded up all the other losers, and when they get here, it’s time to fucking party! Break out the booze!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There will be no alcoholic beverages,” Kirumi amends politely. “Miu meant to say—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She’s cut off by exceptionally loud music that starts to blare from Miu’s machine. Kirumi seems slightly irritated but remains composed, even as Miu starts jumping around her excitedly in what Kaede thinks is supposed to be her version of dancing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The others come quickly, some like Gonta and Kiibo openly express their amazement at the scenery, while others like Ryoma and Maki, who surprisingly showed up at all, remain more reserved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Gonta says. “Is this a dance? Gonta has never been to a dance before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “No, Miu’s just being fucking weir—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course it is!” Kokichi says. “And Kaito’s my partner!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like hell I’ll—quit pulling!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, how exciting!” Angie claps. “Himiko, God says you should dance with Angie!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Himiko says. “That sounds like a lot of work…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko thinks it would be fun!” Tenko stammers, face flaming red. “Tenko w-would also like to dance with Himiko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Himiko just juts out her lower lip. “Nyeh… so tiring…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches as everyone chooses to participate at various levels from Kokichi eagerly dragging Kaito around in what looks more like a game of tag than anything else, to Maki standing quietly against the wall, though oddly not leaving.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As she watches, she doesn’t even notice Tsumugi right next to her until the other girl speaks. “It seems like everyone is having so much fun. I don’t think I ever expected anything like this to happen in a situation like ours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t really either,” Kaede says. “But… it’s nice. Maybe it doesn’t really solve anything but,” she sighs. “It’s still nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, seeing everyone so happy,” Tsumugi says. “And so full of hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Hope?’” Kaede asks. “What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, just, you know,” Tsumugi says before shaking her with a laugh. “Sorry, that probably didn’t make any sense. I don’t know why I was even just thinking something like that now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. Then after a moment, “hey, Tsumugi, do you want to dance with me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Huh? Really? Are you sure you want to with someone as plain as me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “You gotta stop saying that. And yeah, why not? It’s not like there’s anyone to embarrass ourselves in front of besides these guys, and they’re, well, you know.” With that she pointedly jerks her chin at Miu’s rather awkward flailing at the front of the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh, good point,” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, Tsumugi consents easily enough, and Kaede finds herself actually having fun under their manmade stars.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>Hand Mirror, Chapter Three</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At breakfast one morning, Kaito sighs, obviously irritated, before jerking to a standing position, catching the attention of everyone else gathered. “Alright, you know what,” he announces, pressing his fists together. “I’ve decided. If everyone else is gonna form their stupid student council crap, then the rest of us have to do something, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, ‘the rest of us?’” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, huh, huh?” Angie asks. “Does everyone else want to join the student council, too? Angie will have to ask God first, before—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “I’m not joining your weird cult. Instead, I say the rest of us just form our own group.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Isn’t that just going to divide us more?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, shh!” Kokichi hushes. “I wanna hear Kaito’s dumb plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your own group?” Angie asks. “Kaito, is God talking to you, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “I’m just saying this as me—I don’t need any shitty God to boss me around.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede notices Angie’s smile darken slightly at that answer, but Gonta speaks up before she can protest. “Um, Gonta is confused. Kaito, what are we doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That seems to catch Kaito slightly off guard. “Uh, well—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ha!” Miu shouts. “Didn’t think that fucking far did you, Momoron?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did, too!” he says. “Uh, let’s see. It’s me, Kokichi, Gonta, and Ryoma, right? So we’ll do some manly bonding activity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s upper lip curls. “Gross.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu flushes. “Manly boning?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I believe he said ‘bonding,’ Miu,” Kiibo corrects.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Ryoma says. “Tsumugi’s also not on the student council.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Tenko gasps. “Kaito! How dare you forget Tsumugi! Apologize right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-Ah, it’s really okay,” Tsumugi says. “I mean, it only makes sense to forget someone as plain as me, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still,” Tenko says. “Poor Tsumugi should not be forced into… whatever disgusting male degenerate bonding activity Kaito wants to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Tsumugi!” Angie says. “You should join Angie’s student council!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, wait Tsumugi,” Kaito says. “I’ll get Harumaki to come too, don’t you worry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi simply shrinks under the sudden attention on her. “Oh, uh, okay…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Boo! Don’t invite killer girl,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito ignores him to slam his fists together. “Alright—everyone who’s not in a cult follow me to the second floor.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, he heads towards the exit. No one else makes a move to follow him before Kokichi chirps, “okay! Guess it’ll be a date for just the two of us!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito squawks in protest as Gonta looks down to ask Ryoma, “Ryoma do you want to go? Gonta thinks it might be fun to do… ‘manly bonding.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs. “Well, suppose it could kill a few hours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, if everyone’s going,” Tsumugi says. “Then I guess I’ll go, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches them as they leave, distantly hearing Himiko finally stir from her nap when Kaito slams the doors closed behind them. “Huh? Where’d everyone go…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko starts to fuss over her while Angie hums. “Hmm, hmm, hmm, God isn’t so sure about that,” she says. “Angie wants everyone to have fun, buuut God thinks they should have supervised fun.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “You want someone to spy on them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God just thinks someone should check on them!” Angie corrects. “Just to make sure—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’ll do it!” Miu says, leaping to her feet. “I’d be perfect to watch a bunch of guys bone—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bond,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“—with each other! I could watch them all day!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay!” Angie says clasping her hands. “But make sure they don’t see you, okay Miu?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds like spying to me,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Angie says. “Kaede, do you want to go too? Oh, oh, God wants to know if you have any supplies that will make checking up on them easier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede works her jaw for a second, trying to process how to respond. “Uh, I,” she frowns. “I guess I have a hand mirror on me? Maybe you could use that to see around corners?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mirror, pfft,” Miu says. “How ‘bout a camera?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God says that sounds perfect, Kaede!” Angie says. “Okay, Angie will leave it to you and Miu then!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says. “What exactly are we even supposed to be do—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu leaps to her feet. “Come on, Bakamatsu! You better not let those whale tits of yours slow me down!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, wait—” Kaede manages to get out before Miu physically drags her out of the cafeteria, giggling to herself excitedly. “Miu!” she calls again once they make it to the hallway. “Stop—we can’t just go spy on people!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu lets out an aggravated sigh as she turns to face her. “Bakamatsu, do you understand what’s happening? This is a once in a lifetime opportunity—what kinda girl who’s not Chabashitra would pass something like this up!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not sure exactly what you think we’re going to be walking in on,” Kaede says. “I mean, their ‘bonding activity’ is something Kaito made up in like five minutes. And this is <i>Kaito</i> we’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” Miu says. “And what was space case’s idea for you two to bond? Getting all hot and worked up and sweaty—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean exercising?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God, do I have to spell out everything for you?” Miu says. “Yeah, and what do a bunch of guys all do after exercising?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses, genuinely confused for a second. “Stop… exercising?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu slaps a hand to her forehead. “Showers, Bakamatsu! They’re all gonna get naked and touch each other! Haven’t you ever seen a high school movie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly feels her face turn red. “I-I’ve never watched a movie where that happens!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, then it’s time for life to imitate art,” Miu says before cackling. “And this better be a fucking masterpiece.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu begins to strut down the hall, and Kaede hurries to keep pace with her. “Okay, even if that is the case—which it’s not—then that would be a huge breach of their privacy. It’s unethical.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu throws her hands in the air. “Listen, tits, if you wanna be a goody-two-shoes, then you can fuck off. I’ll tell Sunday school we saw all their secret plans and blah blah blah.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—” Kaede starts to say. “You shouldn’t go either! Come on, how would you feel if they wanted to spy on us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu pauses. Then, a blush begins to rise over her cheeks and Kaede realizes her mistake. “That’d be pretty fucking hot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their progress towards the second floor is exceedingly slow as Kaede tries to talk Miu down with each argument that comes to her. It’s only when they reach the rather spacious floor that the two girls realize they really have no idea where Kaito actually took the others. Kaede is thankful for the distraction, though none of her protests seem to hinder Miu’s focus on her mission.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only after barely escaping Gonta’s thoroughly infested lab that they spy Tsumugi walking their way, her usual jacket tied around her waist and her hair gather up in a ponytail. “Oh,” she says. “Kaede, Miu, what are you doing here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede freezes for a second, feeling as if she was actually caught in the act Miu was pressing her to do. “We were just, uh—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Looking pretty sweaty there, Shittygane,” Miu cackles. “Take all four of them at once?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “No, we were only playing tennis in Ryoma’s lab. I’m not the protagonist of some adult harem series or anything like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu opens her mouth again, and Kaede jumps to speak before she can get another word in. “So did you just finish? Where are the guys?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They wanted to play one more round,” she says. “Ryoma was sitting out to judge since there were five of us, but Kaito insisted he play against him once, and Gonta really wanted him to do it too, so I volunteered to sit out. And I was getting pretty tired anyway. But,” she casts a wary eye back the way she came. “I think they probably would have finished by now. I wonder if they decided to use the shower room up there, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu starts salivating. “Sh-Shower room?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They were talking about it earlier,” Tsumugi says. “It plainly seemed a little silly to me since they all have showers in their rooms, but I guess since I left early maybe they’d feel a little less awkward about using it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu spins on her heel to face Kaede, clasping her hands. “Bakamatsu, this is a one time chance. Boys. Shower room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says, pulling a face. “Are you guys… going to go, you know,” she shifts awkwardly. “I mean, I know it’s a staple of most high school anime, but I don’t know if any of the guys here are really the fan service type.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a dubious look. “That’s what you’re concerned about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Shittygane,” Miu says. “What about you? You wanna graduate up to some 3D action?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Miu!” Kaede chastises.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me?” Tsumugi says. “I-I’m not sure, though…” she pauses. “I guess I am plain enough that they might not notice me, and I could always say I just forgot something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi, not you, too,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Miu grins. “Then it’s settled. Right, Bakamatsu, you can find your own alone time material.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The two begin to head off leaving Kaede behind before she feels physically compelled to run after them. “Wait—come on guys! You can’t actually be serious about doing this!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bakamatsu, I have never been more serious about anything in my fucking life,” Miu says. “And also if you don’t pipe down you’re gonna get us all caught.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that might be bad,” Tsumugi says. “Okay. I’ll be as quiet as possible then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just groans, and Miu shushes her again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When they reach the door to Ryoma’s talent lab, Tsumugi pulls it open by fractions to reveal the room inside completely empty. At that, Kaede lets out a sigh of relief. “Well, looks like it’s no good. Guess we should just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, shut the fuck up,” Miu says, pointing across the room.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks to the directed area and sees the door to the shower room in the back slightly ajar with the slightest tendrils of steam seeping out of it. She feels her face flare in warmth even as she hisses whispered warnings to Tsumugi and Miu already quietly moving towards the door. Kaede, beleaguered, follows after them, half wandering why she hasn’t already turned tail and run when Miu holds out a hand to her. “Bakamatsu,” she whispers. “Mirror.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses in confusion for a second before almost automatically retrieving the hand mirror from her backpack. Miu takes it gingerly, and carefully positions it just around the edge of the door before gesturing for her and Tsumugi to come look. Kaede takes a deep breath and peers down at the reflected image.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She barely represses her sigh of relief when she sees all of the boys are almost completely fully clothed. Miu mutters darkly under her breath, and Kaede hears Tsumugi softly say, “oh, I guess we took too long…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a moment to tune into to hear their conversations drift through the door. Ryoma’s only missing his coat and his beanie as he gathers used towels together into a reasonably neat heap while Gonta pulls on his button up. Kaede has to stifle a laugh at the sight of his long tangled hair done up in a towel and piled on top of his head. Ryoma seems to find it amusing, too, as he stops his work to say, “that’s a good look.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta smiles brightly back at him. “Thank you! Gonta’s hair is pretty messy, but Gonta would like to keep it clean like a gentleman would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dude,” Kaito says, causing Kaede to direct her attention to him. He’s still shirtless with only a towel hanging around his neck, though from Miu’s grumbling Kaede takes that that’s not what the other girl was hoping for. What interests Kaede more is that he’s near one of the sinks, comb in one hand while the other pushes back what looks like an especially knotted clump of hair on the back of Kokichi’s head. “Whatever the hell you do—roll around in dirt, keep an ant colony in it, whatever—your hair has to be cleaner than Kokichi’s.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Rude,” Kokichi huffs, crossing his arms. Despite his usual small form, he seems somehow even thinner without his scarf warped around his neck, even though it appears to be the only piece of clothing he’s missing. “As if Kaito’s hair isn’t super gross from all that nasty dried gel.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I use actual hair products not,” Kaito waves the comb dramatically. “Whatever shit this is! Is your pillow made of fucking chewed gum or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, now that I think about—hey!” Kokichi yelps when Kaito makes what looks like a particularly hard yank with the comb. “You’re hurting me! Gonta, save me! Kaito’s trying to torture me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Gonta seems surprisingly unfazed by his crying. “But didn’t Kokichi ask Kaito to help him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not with my hair,” Kokichi rolls his eyes. “I don’t need your—Kaito, stop pulling!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’d pull less if you’d quit squirming around,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know,” Ryoma says. “If it’s that bad, you could just cut it off.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That makes Kokichi burst into tears. “No! Kaito! If you cut off my hair, I’ll never forgive you! I’ll sic my entire organization on you, and then when you become a ghost, I’ll—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Calm down,” Kaito says. “I wouldn’t cut another man’s hair without his permission.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Gonta says. “Really? Is a man’s hair special?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hell yeah it is,” Kaito beams. “It’s part of his sense of style—it’s who he is and how he presents himself to the world. You don’t just go changing that shit without asking a guy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or you join a sports team and cut it off for regulations,” Ryoma says dully.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito sighs. “Come on man, you know it’s more complicated than that. After all, you dye yours, so you’d know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma dyes his hair?” Gonta asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At that, Ryoma seems slightly embarrassed. “Well, I’m not planning to do it again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You should, man,” Kaito says. “It’s a good look for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Gonta also thinks so,” Gonta says. “Maybe Gonta should try dyeing his hair, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma smiles. “That might be interesting. Not sure if we have the supplies here for it, though.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then Gonta will do it when we escape,” he says brightly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says. “That… that could be nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wow,” Kokichi says. “Are you guys seriously taking style tips from <i>Kaito</i>? Have you seen the way he dresses?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito balks. “What’s wrong with the way I dress? It makes me look cool!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, you don’t just look like a circus clown,” Kokichi says. “You look like a blind circus clown with a fetish for the color purple got dressed in the dark two days ago and then rolled out of bed after letting a bunch of beauty school dropouts attack their hair with spray paint.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s it,” Kaito says. “I’m cutting off all your hair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nooooo!” Kokichi whines.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles at their conversation as Miu finally removes the mirror, still scowling deeply. “Fucking waste of time,” she mumbles darkly as she stalks back out of the room.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks after her and then to Kaede for silent confirmation. Kaede tilts her head in Miu’s direction and they quietly follow her out. “Well,” Tsumugi says once they exit Ryoma’s lab. “That wasn’t really what I was expecting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just how much does this goddamn school wanna blue ball me,” Miu says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then a voice asks, “What are you doing?” and Kaede spins on her heel to see Maki staring them down suspiciously.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing!” Miu shouts, throwing her hands in the air. “Abso-fucking-lutely nothing! Ugh!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that she stomps away without another word of explanation. They watch her leave, and Kaede clears her throat. “Well, I guess I should go report to Angie. This has been… informative.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Has it?” Tsumugi asks with a tilt of her head as Kaede waves goodbye to her and thoroughly confused Maki.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s standing outside the dorms, sighing loudly with the obvious goal to catch someone’s attention when Kaede makes her way out of her room that morning. “What are you doing?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just thinking,” he says. “This place has gotten… pretty bleak lately, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but feel a lump form in her throat at his words. “Yeah, I guess it has… but I don’t think there’s much we can do about it. I mean, what do you do when people are grieving and afraid?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “Still sucks, though. I know it doesn’t help shit, but it’d be nice to do something to get my mind off of everything for a while, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “I think Tsumugi was saying something like that earlier. I know she was also looking for people to cosplay with, too, so maybe—” he gives her a withering look and Kaede can’t help but smile teasingly as she continues “—you should hit her up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Pass.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede laughs. “I figured—cosplay is kinda specific to cosplayers. So what do astronauts do when they’re bored?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Train,” he answers. “But… not sure if that’s gonna happen right now. Tenko’d kill me if she caught me trying to do any exercise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not wrong about that,” she says. “I guess that kind of leaves you out of luck, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, no,” Kaito says, suddenly seeming thoughtful. “Being an astronaut’s about way more than just being in physical shape. You also gotta train your mind, too, so you can think logically and make quick decisions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That sounds useful,” Kaede agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah! When I was at this one training camp, they had us do all these logic puzzles and shit,” Kaito brightens as he recalls the memory. “And I got to be really good at them. Like, I was by far and away the best at this one thing—it’s called a milk puzzle—where you have blank puzzle pieces and have to fit them together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says. “I actually think I found something like that the other day. Do you wanna try it later?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins, pressing his fists together. “Hell yeah. I’m gonna show you the ropes, but I’m also not gonna go easy on you just ‘cause you’re my partner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is putting together a puzzle a competition?” Kaede asks before the two head up to breakfast.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their conversation through the meal appears to have caught a few ears, and when the two wander back outside to set up under the arbor, Kaede’s only barely emptied the box onto the table when Kokichi seems to appear out of nowhere.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kaede and Kaito were planning a secret date!” he gasps. “And you didn’t invite me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito groans. “Knock it off with that crap. You’re starting to sound like Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What? Are you saying I’m boring now? B-But Kaito,” he begins to sniffle.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t say that about her,” Kaede scolds. “Tsumugi is nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “She’d be even nicer if she’d quit trying to get me to date someone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah!” Kokichi agrees. “How dare she play matchmaker when Kaito’s already—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what you’re going to say, and I don’t want to know,” Kaito says. “Now, Kaede are you almost done setting up or not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so?” Kaede says staring down slightly confused at the vast array of blank pieces before her. “I’m not sure if they’re the right side up or not, though I guess that’s kind of the point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi’s eyes gleam as he looks over the table. “Oh, wow you’re actually doing something not boring. Good for you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito rolls his eyes. “Glad to fucking know you approve.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course you are!” Kokichi says. “After all, Kaito cares about what everyone thinks about him, huh? Because if everyone wasn’t telling you how great you are, then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “If you want to play, too, you can. You don’t have to be obnoxious about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that’s possible for him,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It really isn’t,” Kokichi agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs. “We’re doing this to have fun, okay? So can we please just… not be at each other’s throats?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can,” Kaito says. “But I’m not so sure about him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kaito, no fair!” Kokichi says. “That’s what I was going to say! Take it back!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Take what back?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t even know what I’m talking about? Geeze, how much of an idiot are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quit calling me a fucking idiot!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t call you a <i>fucking</i> idiot. Just the regular kind!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito’s cursing at me!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>Guys,</i>” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito throws his hands in the air. “It’s not me! He’s the one doing it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just runs a hand over her face. “You know what? Maybe we should just do this later. I think I need a nap—my head hurts all of a sudden.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, Kaito, look what you did to poor Kaede,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, did you only follow us here so you could be an asshole?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears their bickering follow her as she makes her way to her room. It’s only a few hours later when she finally feels the energy to attempt to make her way back out again. Outside is distinctly quiet, and both Kaito and Kokichi seem to have taken off to their own devices at some point while she was gone.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes about one step towards the arbor when she notices an unexpected figure sitting at the table, hunched over the puzzle nearly completed. Kaede takes care to be as silent as possible as she creeps another step closer to examine Maki, sitting calmly with her brow furrowed in concentration, one snow white piece held aloft in her hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches for another moment and sees Maki slowly reach down to click the piece into place, a slight smile of satisfaction curling over her normally cold features. From this distance, she looks almost normal, as if she could be just a regular teenager.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But Kaede knows the longer she stays to watch, the more likely she is to get caught and scurries away towards the school.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Later, when she returns for the evening, she sees Kaito standing over the completed puzzle looking at it curiously. As Kaede walks over to him, he looks up at her, and says, “Hey, Kaede, did you come back and finish the puzzle all by yourself? That’s pretty impressive for a beginner.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It wasn’t me,” Kaede says. “I actually saw Maki doing it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” he says, eyebrows shooting up towards his hairline. “Huh, I had no idea Harumaki was into this kind of thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over the smooth surface of the puzzle finished seemingly just for the fun of it. “I didn’t either…” She shakes her head. “Still, I wonder why she didn’t tell you at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s grinning broadly. “She was probably embarrassed. You know how some people try and act all mature? Harumaki’s kinda like that, but I know she just wants to goof off like anyone else from time to time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m kinda having a hard time imaging Maki ‘goofing off,’” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But didn’t you say you saw her?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah, but,” Kaede tugs at her hat. “I don’t think that’s quite the same thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito studies Kaede briefly before he goes back to smiling. “Anyway, now I definitely know what I’m gonna do. Kaede—if you find any other puzzles, bring them to me. I wanna surprise Harumaki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think if you do that she’s just gonna ask if you want to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He laughs. “Maybe, but then I could teach her about logic puzzles, and oh—I think I actually picked up a book of them a while ago! Well I know how I’m spending my night! Bye, Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Despite her hesitations, Kaede can only smile as he hurries off with a slight skip in his step. “Try not to stay up too late!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, sure, mom!”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t show up to dinner that night. Everyone else is assembled in the dining hall, and though Kaede doubts Tenko is in any danger, she can’t help the budding worry starting to rise in her chest.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says, voice soft enough that only she can hear. “Tenko’s not coming is she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods, and Kaede assumes the brief conversation ends there until a few minutes later, he says, “Any idea where she might be?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think she said she was going to her lab,” Kaede says. “That… neo-aikido could help her with,” she sighs, “everything, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Ryoma says. He shifts slightly to glance at the dining hall clock, muttering under his breath, “almost nighttime. She should show up soon if she wants anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but wince. “I don’t think she’s going to come. Being here is hard for her after… what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma turns back to the stare down at the table. “Yeah. Yeah, I get that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t try and speak to her again until they finish eating and Monokuma arrives to remind them to get the hell out of the dining hall for nighttime. Ryoma only catches her attention again when they exit, starting to drift slowly back to the dorms. “Hey, Kaede, you…” he shifts slightly to pull an orange out of his pocket. “Grabbed this before we left. You think Tenko’d take it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She might,” Kaede says. “Are you going to bring it to her? That’s really nice of you, Ryoma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he says. “It’ll be if she accepts it. Don’t… really know her that well. Mostly just know how she feels about guys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There’s more to her than that,” Kaede says. “But, well, I guess she can be a bit abrasive towards boys sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma looks dubious at her word choice but opts to only ask, “how do you think she’d take a guy showing concern for her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably not very well,” Kaede says. “If you want, I could come with you. I think I actually picked up some stuff earlier that might be good for a light snack at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you should go alone,” he holds the orange out to her. “Here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “I don’t think so, Ryoma. It was your idea, so you should come too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s probably not a great—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” Kaede says sternly. “I know it’s been a while, but I’m pulling my ‘I’m the leader’ card.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma just shakes his head with a small smile, not upset with her demands in the slightest. “Guess I don’t have a choice then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma isn’t much one for conversation, and they say little on their way there. At their arrival, Kaede notices Tenko sitting out on the front steps of her dojo, fiddling with something in her hands.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” she says. “We brought you something to eat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko jerks at their words, quickly shuffling whatever she was messing with closer to herself. “O-Oh, Tenko missed dinner, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says, finding it difficult to keep her voice cheerful. “Ryoma wanted to bring you something. I have…” she shifts to rifle through her backpack to draw out a fully sliced apple. “These, and Ryoma also grabbed an orange.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not a balanced meal,” Ryoma says. “Sorry. Should have thought about it earlier.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, that’s fine,” Tenko says. “Tenko isn’t very hungry right now anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “But weren’t you just exercising?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually, Tenko, um,” she looks down to the objects in her hands, which Kaede now recognizes as playing cards. “She was looking through her room and… found these.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, those are from—” Kaede cuts herself off before she can repeat the memory of Tenko applauding each and everyone of Himiko’s tricks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glances between them, seeming to gauge the situation from their few words. “Not sure if I know many tricks, but have learned enough card games in my time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma, you sound like an old man,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs as he takes a tentative seat a respectable distance away from Tenko. “Maybe. They were useful in prison to kill time, at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For some reason, that makes Kaede flinch. With all the time she’s spent with Ryoma, that fact managed to somehow slip her mind. “Er, right, I guess they would.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko…” Tenko says, voice faltering slightly. “Tenko knows… ten-two-jack. She would play it with her master sometimes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “That one’s alright. Most of the guys I knew it prison were more into poker or anything else you could bet on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Isn’t that gambling?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t have to,” Ryoma says. “Never was really interested in playing for cigarettes, but,” he hesitates for a second before saying, “did get pretty good at counting cards.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Counting cards?’” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma hesitates for another moment before sighing. “Don’t ever let anyone catch you doing this, but there’s this game called blackjack…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a few minutes of listening to Ryoma explaining the rules and subsequent strategy, Tenko shifted to collect the cards in her lap before extending them to Ryoma. “Here… Tenko thinks it might be easier with a demonstration.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very carefully, Ryoma takes them from her, treating them as if they were precious. “Thanks… I’ll give them right back, Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, um,” Tenko shakes her head. “Tenko thinks… maybe we should play. If Kaede wants to, that is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hurries to sit down on Tenko’s other side. “I would be happy to. Although, I can’t even really shuffle,” she says with a slight laugh.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma smiles. “Could probably teach you that, too, if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks she can do that,” she says softly. “When Tenko was little, she wanted to do magic tricks, but she’d always get too frustrated and just throw the cards on the ground, and then master would make her pick them up, but,” she draws her knees up to her chest. “Then they’d always play a game with her, anyway, even if Tenko made them mad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your master sounds like a good person,” Ryoma says. Then he smile turns just a bit playful. “When you get out of here, don’t tell them I taught you how to count cards, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko wouldn’t tell them about any awful trick any awful boy taught her,” she says, though her words lack any venom. Instead, they seem the closest to happy Kaede thinks she’s heard her all night.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I won’t tell anyone either,” Kaede says. “Though I do think we should play for money.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko whirls around to face her while even Ryoma seems slightly surprised. “Kaede!? Gambling is illegal!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” she says. “But I just have all these extra monocoins lying around, so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” Ryoma says with a quiet laugh. “Guess you learn something new about people everyday.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko never thought that Kaede would have a gambling problem,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“G-Guys!” Kaede protests. “It’s not like that! I promise!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The teasing subsides when Ryoma takes her money one too many times before Kaede begins to suspect he’s throwing games on purpose. She’d grumble a bit more about the sudden lightness in her pockets if it wasn’t for the simplistic but still real happiness lighting up in Tenko’s eyes whenever she’d win a hand, no matter how obviously Ryoma was trying to lose.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After a few too many rounds, Kaede grumbles, “can we maybe play that game Tenko was talking about instead? Or maybe something for kids?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure,” Ryoma says. “If you can win this next hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can do it, Kaede,” Tenko says. “Tenko believes in you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can only hang her head mumbling, “I don’t believe in me…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma laughs just a little again but takes mercy on her enough to switch to something Tenko eagerly explains that her master told her there were no winners or losers in.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Goodnight, Kaede!” Kokichi says, his voice reverberating slightly off the hanger’s walls. “If you snore, I’ll kill you in your sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, whatever,” Kaede says, shifting to attempt to find a comfortable position in the Exisal’s cockpit. Her arm brushes awkwardly against the seat’s meager padding, and Kaede hisses at the contact. “Ugh, do you think we’re actually gonna get any sleep in here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have no idea what you’re talking about, Kaede, I’m already asleep,” Kokichi says dully from his sleeping bag.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi, this is miserable,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He huffs as he rolls over to face her. “If you hate it so much, then you are more than welcome to go back to your room, princess. You can sleep on your silk sheets and your feather pillows and dream about kissing boys and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re miserable, too,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I’m not,” Kokichi says. “I’m having the time of my life having a sleep over with my very favorite Kaede. Hey, do you want to stay up and braid each other’s hair and tell secrets and talk about boys?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “I know you’re trying to make fun of me, but I don’t think it would hurt to actually do some of those things.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede wants to braid my hair,” he says, batting his eyelashes at her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, but maybe we should share some secrets and talk about boys, or at least,” she shifts around to grab her backpack and pulls a familiar looking, small circular mechanical device. “One boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi sits up. “Huh? Is that like a lamer version of Miu’s star projector thing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sighs as she stands from the Exisal. “I know you know that whole thing was Kaito’s idea. Hey, is there a place where I can plug this in?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just shrugs. “It’s a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi remains little help, opting to simply snipe at her from his spot on the floor until Kaede finally finds a close enough outlet to allow her to place the home planet roughly in the center of the room where Kokichi established his camp. “There we go,” she says, finally flicking it on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The display is not nearly as impressive as the one Miu had enhanced for them so long ago, but Kaede is still content with her work as she takes a seat next to a now strangely quiet Kokichi. “It’s not quite the same without the music and Kaito lecturing us, but, still,” she leans forward resting her head on her knees. “This is nice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi just rolls over away from her. “Man, Kaede is such a loser. <i>And</i> she’s gonna keep me up all night with her stupid nightlight.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll turn it off after a minute, okay?” Kaede says. “I just want to do something instead of sitting around feeling sorry for myself.” She looks over his small form bundled under the sleeping bag. “Especially since it seems like you’re doing more than enough of that for the both of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, did you just come here to bully me?” he asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you admit you’re just wallowing in—”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks towards the notably silent planetary system. “If you don’t want to talk, that’s fine. Just let me have this for a little while.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi stays quiet, though Kaede hears the sounds of him sitting up after a while. She lets a few more moments of silence pass before she says softly, “I think that’s the, um, something nebula. I remember Kaito got really excited about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He got excited about every dumb star this thing has,” Kokichi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, maybe,” she says. “Did he ever tell you the reason why he got Miu to make a big one in the first place? Apparently he used to have one of these when he was a kid and he wanted to share that with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that story supposed to make me feel anything?” Kokichi says. “Or did you just tell it to bore me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shrugs. “I just thought it was interesting. But if you felt something, good for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi goes quiet again, and Kaede takes a second to summon all the patience she knows she’ll need for this conversation as she turns back to look at him. “You know Kaito’s not the mastermind, right? I know you said you don’t trust anyone, but that can’t actually be true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smirks at her. “Kaede, I’m the only one allowed to say ‘that was a lie.’ You don’t get to do it for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow. “You keep dodging all my questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You keep not accepting my answers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “God, how does Kaito have actual conversations with you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who knows?” Kokichi says. “Kaito’s just too much of a stubborn idiot to give up, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You really should stop calling him an idiot,” Kaede says automatically. Then something in his words clicks in her brain and she adds, “especially since he hasn’t given up on you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi smiles again. “I don’t get you. I told you over and over that I don’t care that everyone hates me, but you keep bringing it up. You know, I’m starting to think you actually are trying to bully me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t say that,” Kaede says. “Since the point I’m trying to make is that someone <i>doesn’t</i> hate you. And I don’t get why you want them to so badly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi groans. “I already explained this! Geeze, Kaede! Everyone could be the mastermind, so only an idiot would bother with trying to buddy up to anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I just don’t think I can understand that,” Kaede frowns. “I mean, I think I’d rather risk someone betraying me than being too scared to even try and make friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I seriously doubt I signed up for this killing game to make friends,” Kokichi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you to quit joking about that,” Kaede snaps.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever.” Kokichi flops on to his back with a huff. “And, Kaede, you know I don’t <i>care</i> about making friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks over her shoulder at his prone form. “What, are you gonna say something edgy like ‘I don’t have friends.’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, I don’t,” he says. “Unless super sweet ingénue Kaede wants to be poor little old me’s friend.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wasn’t talking about me,” Kaede says. “And I know you’re just gonna try and weasel out of it, but you do know Kaito is your friend. Or at least he would be if you’d let him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi snorts. “Please. If you’re lying to try and make me feel better, you should know it’s not working.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi,” Kaede says. “I promise I would never try to bother with comforting you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He beams up at her. “Likewise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Their conversation seems to end comfortably there, but the conversation Kaede had with Kaito back in his lab burns just a bit too much in the back of her mind. “Well, whatever you decide, you should give Kaito a break sometimes. I don’t know why, but he really does think you’re a good person.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, like way, way, way past a few levels of hell deep down kind of thing?” Kokichi says nonchalantly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “Just… the way you are. You could try harder to be decent, but, I mean, everyone should do that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kokichi doesn’t respond, and it’s only when Kaede hears him shifting with his blankets to try and get into a sleeping position does he speak again. “If Kaito comes by, tell him he’s an idiot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clicks off the home planet, leaving them in darkness save the few ambient lights. “You know that hurts his feelings.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tell him he smells.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smirks at him as she rolls her eyes. “Tell him yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, you smell and you’re an idiot,” he says without moving an inch from his spot.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Goodnight, Kokichi.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The footage runs in tiny, fragmented streams before the Mother Monokuma. “Hundreds of thousand of nanokumas,” it muses. “And so much <i>crap!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that, the images of the everyday and the mundane flicker out of existence, the Mother Monokuma chanting, “garbage, garbage, flaming garbage, garbage. Alright, note to all nanokumas, if it’s boring as shit, then don’t send it back here! Man, do we need another editor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says, the scenes quickly disappearing in the reflection of her glasses. “None of these are making it to air?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“God, no. Are you kidding?” it says. “We’re in the entertainment business! What part of this is entertaining to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She pauses. Then, “whatever you think is best.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever I know is best,” the Mother Monokuma huffs. “And trust me when I say no one wants to watch this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t say anything else. The Mother Monokuma deletes the footage without a word of protest.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wakes up far before the morning announcement. A few minutes pass before she even bothers to check her monopad to confirm the early time. When she finds the motivation to actually discover it’s only a little past six, all she can do is squeeze her eyes closed for a moment before resigning herself to stare at her ceiling.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The days before had felt like a whirlwind. Everything since Miu’s death had come as one blow after another. Part of Kaede can’t even process what happened as real yet. Her arm still hurts, her head aches, and her throat is sore from when she had screamed at Kaito that he was wrong and she was right.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely pays attention to her own movements as her fingers brush slightly against the lingering bruises on her cheek. She’s going to have to talk to Kaito later.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The thought doesn’t inspire much action, however, as she lets her hand drop back to her side. She doesn’t know when she would have finally taken the incentive to get up that morning if it weren’t for her doorbell suddenly ringing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s enough of a surprise that Kaede jerks to sit up. Her monopad tells her she’s wasted an hour, but there’s still an hour before the morning announcement. Whoever is waiting outside seems patient enough as Kaede hears no other sounds from the door on her cautious trek over to it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s standing on the other side when she finally opens the door, hands folded politely in front of her and a pleasant enough smile on her face. “Good morning, Kaede,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, morning,” Kaede says back, not bothering to hide her confusion. “Did you need something? It’s still really early, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I know,” Tsumugi says. “And I’d apologize for waking you up, too, but you weren’t sleeping anyway, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a sigh. “That obvious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s smile is sympathetic as she says, “it’s okay. I’d have thought anyone would have trouble sleeping after that trial. Though we’re the only two up right now, so I guess maybe the exhaustion put everyone to sleep.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, following her logic until something strikes her as slightly odd. “Wait. Did you already go check on the others?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I didn’t personally,” Tsumugi says. “Monokuma just told me. He also told me you were awake, so it seemed like the perfect time for us to have a chat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Any lingering feelings of sleepiness evaporate in an instant as Kaede stares at her wide eyed. “Wha—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “Really the nanokumas—those tiny camera things Ryoma told everyone about—they told the Mother Monokuma, which then told Monokuma, who then told me.” She shakes her head with a laugh. “Not the best system, I know, but sometimes you just have to make do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede still has very little idea how to process what’s happening right in front of her, only managing to stammer, “Y-You’re just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Admitting it? Kinda,” she says. “Anyway, can I come in? Everyone is still asleep, but it’d be a little unfortunate if we had to cut off early in case someone woke up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At her words, Kaede feels herself go on even higher alert, and she moves to slam the door shut in her face. With her weakened arm, however, she can really only do so much when Tsumugi lunges forward almost immediately to catch the door before it closes. Despite Kaede’s continued attempts to slam the other girl’s fingers in the door, Tsumugi just laughs. “I thought something like this might happen. Guess I should have led with ‘I literally cannot kill or harm you’ first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t let up on the door even as she allows herself the curiosity to grit out between her clenched teeth, “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The second kill rule,” Tsumugi says. “I’d only get away with doing something if someone else was already dead, and right now that’s not the case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “How do I know you’re not lying?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, Kaede, you don’t need to believe in me for this one,” she says. “You know the others—do you really think any of them would murder someone now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps her gaze hard, but her grip on the door laxes. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because I think we should talk,” Tsumugi says. “I know you’re suspicious—honestly, I’d be pretty surprised if you weren’t—but, really, this is in both of our best interests.” Kaede remains quiet as she keeps studying her. Tsumugi says, “you’re not going to lose anything by hearing what I have to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They wait another moment in tense silent before Kaede finally relents. She steps to the side to allow Tsumugi to pass by her, muttering darkly, “you know I’m just going to tell everyone who you are as soon as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Tsumugi says, voice light and almost frustratingly unconcerned. “I think you should put a hold on that until we’re done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A-And why would I do that!?” Kaede snaps. Tsumugi moves to sit on her bed, and something about her nonchalance unleashes all of the anger Kaede had been holding against the mastermind. “You—you’re the one who trapped us all here and tortured us into killing each other! You created every horrible execution, and—and you killed Himiko in cold blood!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t seem offended by the accusations in the slightest. “Right, right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And!” Kaede jabs a finger in her direction. “You’re only here because your plans are falling apart, aren’t you? Maki and Kokichi ruined your game so now you’re just trying to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that,” Tsumugi says with a dismissive hand wave. “I’ll admit parts of that were definitely a headache, and it’s going to be awfully hard to edit around betting on the wrong horse for the Monokuma File. But it’s all taken care of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede falters then. “What? How could you ‘take care of’ something like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said it,” Tsumugi says. “The magic of editing. With all the nanokumas, editing is always a must. It’s just a little bit more of a must this time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re going to do that to please whatever disgusting audience you have?” Kaede spits. “Is that it? Well what about the rest of the trial? How are you going to just explain that to them?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, first there’s enough extra footage from the trial to cobble something together,” Tsumugi says. “And Kokichi thought he was pretty clever with his little hiding in the Exisal trick, but he should have realized that I already have the ability to mimic his voice with one of the voice changers. And then just filming a blank Exisal with new audio over it is by far one of the easiest fixes to make.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something about that disturbs Kaede in a way she can’t quite articulate. The question that comes to her isn’t the exact one she feels she should be asking, but it comes out with an accompanying look of horror anyway. “So after everything you’ve put us through… you’re just going to lie about it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her, more confused at her reaction than anything else. “Yeah, basically.” When Kaede just keeps staring at her, she shakes her head. “I’m not going to give away everything about who’s watching us, but, Kaede, you know as well as I do that most people don’t really care about logic, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Most people,” Tsumugi continues as if she hadn’t spoken at all. “Just want to be surprised. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t make sense or if it’s all a lie."</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What part of this,” Kaede says, “is supposed to make me not out you the first chance I get?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah,” Tsumugi says. “I guess I should move onto that.” She sighs, almost seeming relaxed as she rests her chin on the palm of her hand. “You know, Kaede, I really wasn’t too happy at first when the nanokumas saw your little conversation with Kiibo, but now I think I’ve come around on it. I’m glad you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” Kaede says. “So you can come here and show me how awful you are in person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She shakes her head with a laugh. “Maybe from your point of view, I suppose. I just like that we can talk openly. No lies.” Kaede narrows her eyes dangerously, and Tsumugi just smiles again. “I do mean that,” she adds. “And I also really mean that our goals align now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches her another moment. Then, “how?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “How do you want this game to end? You and everyone else free, right? And me dead?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what…” Kaede says slowly. “That’s what you want, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “And I know you must be thinking ‘oh if the mastermind wants that then it must be terrible’ but is it really? You either go free or you die. It’s really not that hard a choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you’re choosing death,” Kaede says. “You just said so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tsumugi says. “I’m different. I don’t really count as a participant the same way you do. To the people watching, you’re the ‘survivors’ and I’m ‘the mastermind.’ Well, that’s how it will be when that’s revealed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure why she looks around as if she expects to see the nanokumas suddenly around her. “This isn’t being shown to anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, God no,” Tsumugi says. “It’s being recorded, but none of this is making it anywhere. After all, me sitting down and having a civil chat with you kind of ruins the myth of the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘The myth of the game?’” Kaede repeats.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That we’re locked in, like,” she laughs. “Ah, this sounds so silly saying it aloud, but it’s this idea that you’re in this epic battle between hope and despair with me. It’s very important for the audience, trust me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then I should ruin it,” Kaede says. “I don’t want the sick people watching us to get anything they want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It doesn’t quite work that way, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “Like I said, things can and will be cut. Honestly, I’m also glad the live camera went down, but—” she holds up a hand when Kaede looks like she’s about to question that, “—ignore the audience for now, and just think about the enemy right in front of you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “So… you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right again,” Tsumugi says. “Because, see, you know all this horrible stuff that I’ve done, right? But what if… oh, what if there were even more just plainly awful things I’ve done that you don’t even know about yet? And if you expose me now, well,” she shrugs, “I don’t think you’ll ever be able to find out what they were.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a moment, eyes wide, before she stammers, “y-you’re bluffing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not,” she says. “Like I said, I’m not here to lie. And I’m not here to stop you from telling anyone about me. I’m just asking you to wait a little longer, find the clues I’ve set up, figure out what you should really be mad at me for, <i>then</i> announce your grand discovery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stays quiet for another moment before she asks, “what other things have you done to us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Things I definitely think you would want to know,” Tsumugi replies. “And one or two things very specific to you. Or, well, specific to Shuichi, at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What?” Kaede says before taking an aggressive step towards Tsumugi. “What did you do to—you’re lying, aren’t you? This is all a trick to get me to play your fucked up game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not a trick,” Tsumugi answers calmly. “Though, yes, I would like you to keep playing the game for just a bit longer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I refuse,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why?” Tsumugi asks. “You only have things to gain by doing so. If you play along, you’ll find out the school’s mysteries, condemn me for the right reasons, and then go free with the others while I die. Seems like only positives for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if I tell the others, we kill you and end things right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles almost sadly as she shakes her head. “You’re confusing causation and correlation. I die at the end of the game, yes, but my death doesn’t mean it ends. I’m more replaceable than you think, Kaede. Everyone here is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re replaceable?” Kaede says. “With what? Are there more survivors you can just round up into another killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… close enough to the truth for now,” Tsumugi says. “And if you want the full details, then you really should accept my offer.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if you’re replaceable,” Kaede says. “Then what happens if you do die? We can’t figure out what’s actually happening anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If I die before I reveal myself,” she says. “Then I’ll be treated like any other victim, and whoever kills me will be considered a culprit. And then there will be a trial. It’s funny,” she says, that strange sadness returning to her voice. “Everyone was so determined to find me because they assumed I was so much more important. But I’m still just plain old me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “If you want me to feel sorry for you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, no,” Tsumugi says. “I don’t expect anything like that. You’re a nice person, Kaede, but I’m not expecting mercy from anyone. Especially after you find out all of the things I’ve done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why do you keep hyping up your secret evil deeds or whatever?” Kaede says. “Are you that proud of how horrible you are?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not that,” Tsumugi says. “I just really think you should discover it for yourself. It’ll help you… come full circle, I think. And then,” she smirks, “you can finally succeed in killing the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede freezes at that. “I-I haven’t tried to do that for a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You haven’t,” Tsumugi says. “But you still want to, and that’s all I really want to do, Kaede. I just want to give you and the audience everything you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s really creepy,” Kaede says. “You’re really creepy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, don’t say it like that,” Tsumugi says. “I just have different priorities or values or something, so it’s hard for us to understand each other. But at the end of the day, we both want the hero to win, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’m the hero?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s smile is too fond for Kaede’s comfort. “You are. You almost weren’t, but I am truly happy that that didn’t happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a few steps back when Tsumugi stands, suddenly far too close to her. “I don’t want to be the hero—I don’t want to be anything in your sick game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not up to you, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “You never had a choice, but, still,” she takes another step forward, and Kaede steels herself at her approach. “You’ve been so interesting. There were even times when I started to think you out grew your chara—no,” she steps away, and whatever strange energy had been swirling over them suddenly fades to nothing. “Never mind. Anyway, your thoughts on my proposal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a long moment, trying to take in what just happened between them. “You said there were items to explore left or something,” Kaede says. “When do you give them to us? Are you going to make us wait for another murder?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, no,” Tsumugi says. “There’s doing to be a pretty short exploration since there’s only one more room in the school that’s locked, then Monokuma will give the keycard to the secret room in the library as one more bonus exploration item after we finish. And most of the clues will be in there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And after that?” Kaede says, trying to keep as much authority in her faltering voice as she can.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When you find everything, the Mother Monokuma will say some things and then Monokuma shows up and we’ll challenge him to one last trial to end the game,” she says. “After that, there’re a few more things you’ll need to find, but you’ll have plenty of time to get them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And after the trial, we get to leave, and you die,” Kaede says. “That’s it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “That’s it. So,” she holds her hand out to Kaede, “do we have a deal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede remains where she is as she says, “if for one second I think you’re lying, I’m telling everyone, and Kiibo can back me up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s face falls at the mention of Kiibo’s name. “Oh, right, for this to work you’re going to have to keep him to yourself, you know. Or you could let me take him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think so.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shrugs. “That’s fine. Just keep him quiet until I give the go ahead, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t say anything more until Tsumugi nears the door. Then, “Tsumugi,” she says. “I still don’t get it. What do you get out of this? You’re going to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like I said,” Tsumugi says. “We just have different priorities. You want to live, and I want to see this game through to its proper conclusion.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that conclusion is your death?” Kaede asks. “That still doesn’t make sense. Why do you want to die so badly?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not that I want to die,” she says. “It’s more like… I want to live out my dream, and that dream just happens to end with my death.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede just stares at her in horror. “What kind of a dream is that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A dream where I see my friends succeed,” Tsumugi says. “I mean, we are friends, and who doesn’t want to see their friends do well? I’m not lying,” the genuineness of her smile makes Kaede’s blood run cold, “it’s the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know I don’t believe that,” Kaede says still manages to say. “And no matter what happens, you know I want you dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s fine,” Tsumugi says. “And it doesn’t really matter what happens. I’ll still consider you and everyone else to be some of my closest friends. But I think that’s our different values talking again. Anyway,” she pushes the door open, “I’ll see you later, Kaede,” and slips through without another word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door clicks closed softly, and Kaede summons just enough energy to carry herself back to her bed to collapse back on it. It feels like barely any time passes before the morning announcement plays. Kaede groans and half debates throwing her shoe at it before pulling herself back up to her feet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She takes a minute to try and pull herself together as much as possible before drifting out of her room. Seeing Tsumugi idly talking to Ryoma as the two make their own slow way to the dining hall upsets Kaede far more than it should.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma greets her with a few words and a comment of “doubt anyone will be in the mood to do much of anything after what just happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It takes Kaede half a second to register he’s talking about the trial rather than her private conversation that he logically should have no knowledge of. “A-Ah, right,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wonder if Kaito will come to breakfast,” Tsumugi says. “I’d be plainly surprised if he did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s completely reverted back to her old demure behavior, and Kaede’s mouth presses into a tight line even as Ryoma mutters back to her, “wouldn’t blame him if he skipped.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “Poor Kaito…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede remains uncharacteristically quiet on their walk, explaining it away when Tsumugi asks with, “Just a lot on my mind. Yesterday was a lot to take in.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods in agreement, and their conversation is just as dead when they finally reach the dining hall. The room made for sixteen feels uncomfortably empty, and Tsumugi says, “it’s so quiet. It’s… almost hard to imagine what it was like when everyone was here. It feels like it was so long ago.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says. “Might be only the three of us today, too. Well, four of us maybe.” He glances to Kaede. “Any chance Kiibo might feel like making an appearance.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “I don’t think so. He said he was busy with something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I see,” Tsumugi says. “I wonder if yesterday was hard on him, too. Being forcibly shut down so many times might not have been good for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think it was something like that, yeah,” Kaede agrees.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” Ryoma asks. “Seemed like he was fine at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede only shrugs in response, and is immediately grateful for the dining hall doors swinging open to cut off anymore questions. Tenko enters alone as Tsumugi calls out to her, “Ah, Tenko, are you joining us today?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods and takes a seat with stiff movements. She’s sitting rigid in her chair, and Kaede says, “We could bring you something later if you don’t want to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is fine,” she says. “And there are so few of us left that Tenko thinks she can’t skip meetings anymore if we want to plan anything together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know if we really have any plans,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “We had another trial, so there might be more to explore, but after that I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Okay. Tenko doesn’t know if she’ll be able to explore with everyone. Kaito is still…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He’s not doing great then, huh?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “No. He barely said anything to Tenko last night, and he was still asleep this morning when Tenko left.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Very quietly Kaede asks, “how much time do you think he has left?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not a lot,” Tenko says. “Tenko tried to treat his burns but… she doesn’t know what to do about him coughing up blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And there was a lot of that last night?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Tenko says. “There was. Tenko was actually… really relieved she felt a pulse this morning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “What happens if someone dies of an illness? Do we still have to hold a trial?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede grimaces. “I really hope not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “Something like that would be just awful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They all go quiet, letting their situation truly sink in. Kaede jumps in her chair when the door opens again and a voice calls out, “hey, what’s everyone so down for?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“M-Kaito!?” Tenko shouts, whipping around to face him as he limps towards the table. “What are you doing here!? You need to go back to Tenko’s room and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He waves a hand that Kaede notes with a wince is now coated in gauze. “Relax, Tenko. I’m not about to keel over. ‘Sides I was getting hungry. So,” he turns to the table, “someone mind grabbing me something? Fine motor controls aren’t exactly my thing right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito finishes his statement with a laugh that makes the others exchange a few looks with each other. “Um, Kaito?” Tsumugi says. “How are you feeling?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m great,” he answers. “Just hungry like I said. Maybe a bit hurt that Tenko just ditched me this morning, but since I’m a guy and all I guess I should have seen that coming.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Kaede says. “Kaito, you really don’t need to force yourself to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can we not talk about it?” Kaito snaps. “Look nothing you can say is gonna make what happened yesterday okay. So let’s just not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The table goes quiet, but the scowl on Kaito’s face vanishes the instant Ryoma says, “you said you were hungry?” and starts to pile food on a nearby plate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says brightly. “Knew I could count on you, man. Takes one guy to understand another man’s hunger, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods dully. “Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Seeing Kaito smiling and laughing even as he winces the first time he tries to pick up his utensils hurts. Ryoma plays along in small clipped answers, though Kaede supposes that Kaito was used to talking with Maki enough that building a conversation out of so little feedback was something he trained himself to do long before. Tsumugi talks a little, too, and Tenko’s contribution that he should stop using his hands are dismissed with a wave of his hand.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede had thought seeing him sulk or just hearing that he was holed up in Tenko’s room would be painful. Kaito eats slowly with his damaged hands, and he tries to make a joke worthy of actually laughing at out of Ryoma’s brief reply to him. Kaede watches silently, and her eyes can’t help but wander to the fading bruise on his cheek where she had slapped him across the face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her thoughts are only disrupted by Kiibo beeping to life in her backpack. Kaede bolts at the noise, announcing, “I’ll be right back,” before she hurries out of the dining hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When she pulls him out of his backpack Kiibo says, “Kaede, I wanted to report in again about my progress.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you make it quick?” she asks. “We’re… kind of busy today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Busy?” Kiibo asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “It’s just this thing Monokuma’s making us do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, perhaps I could be of assistance then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “It’s fine. We can handle it. Anyway, what did you want to tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo lowers his voice slightly. “I believe very soon I will be able to gain complete control over the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “Really? What does that mean for us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means I’ll be able to control potentially everything not independent of the school’s network,” he says. “Things like Monokuma, who possess his own A.I., are beyond my control as are machines that are not operated from a remote source like the remaining Exisals.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says, slightly disappointed. “Then what can you control?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The school’s main operating systems,” Kiibo says. “Lights, doors, the central hub where all footage comes in. The cameras themselves appear to be independent A.I. like Monokuma, but I can take control of where and how their footage is processed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Kaede says, brows draw in concentration. “You can turn off lights, open locked doors and… watch security camera footage. Um, Kiibo, I have to be honest with you. I’m not exactly sure how all of that is supposed to help us end the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-There’s more than that!” he says. “I have also taken it upon myself to eliminate the mastermind’s ability to produce more Monokumas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede’s attention. “Really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Kiibo says. “In my search I found something that I believe was the mastermind’s plans for the game. Part of it detailed rebuilding the Monokubs to allow them to pilot the remaining Exisals again. So, I disabled that feature of the Mother Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s amazing,” Kaede says. “So the Monokuma running around now is the last one?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Unless there is another manufacturing process I haven’t discovered, I believe so,” Kiibo says. “And there is one more thing that I believe might be the most important. I might have found a way to interfere with Monokuma’s executions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “He did say something about that last time, which is why Kokichi’s execution… didn’t involve anything with technology.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was unfortunate,” Kiibo says. “I suppose it was also naïve of me to assume Monokuma would not do anything to take measures against my control. However, I still believe it is a good thing that I have limited his options.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so, too,” Kaede says, then hesitates for a moment before adding, “And, um, Kiibo, you said you were looking at a file that told you about the mastermind’s plans? Can you maybe keep searching for stuff like that to let us know what’s coming up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” he says. “Oh, and, Kaede, have you told the others about… your suspicions?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her throat go dry. “Right now everyone is together—including you know who—so… I think I’ll tell everyone more privately, so I don’t draw more attention. And if it gets recorded, you can just delete those conversations so the mastermind doesn’t see them, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I will work on manipulating footage as soon as possible, too,” Kiibo announces. “And I will also report in later with my progress again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, one more thing,” Kaede says. “How much of the footage have you watched?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bits and pieces,” he says. “I’m afraid there is a lot to go through, but I can do a more thorough search of that as well.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” she says. “Maybe put that as a slightly lower priority. The other stuff is more important, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I suppose,” Kiibo says. “Well then, if that is everything, I will contact you when I have made significant progress.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tries to smile at him as she says, “Thanks, Kiibo,” and he turns off.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She slips him back into her backpack and presses the heels of her hands to her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well now, well now, well now,” a familiar voice says from behind her that just makes Kaede groan. “Do we have a genuine double agent on our hands?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She turns to Monokuma tilting his furry head at her. “I cannot wait until you die,” she says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So cold, so heartless, so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you going to give us the crap to explore yet or not?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma huffs. “What else do you think I hauled myself out of my cozy bed for? Because I just wanted to see you brats’ smiling faces?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then let’s go,” she says, already turning back towards the dining hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” he says, waddling after her. “Got one more question for you, missy. Now this is just from one bear to another, but you happen to know where that little old remote for the Exisals got carried off to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No?” Kaede says. “Is it missing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma hums. “Okay, alright, I gotcha. Welp! Thanks for nothing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With that he hurries ahead of her, tiny arms throwing the doors back to the cafeteria open. Kaede rolls her eyes as she walks around him to sit back with the others. “Someone interrupted me,” she says plainly as she sits down.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ahem, ahem,” Monokuma says. “Settle down everyone. Your headmaster has an important announcement.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We have to run around and explore shit now?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Monokuma snaps. “The announcement is that your lovely headmaster has brought you wonderful, just to die for gifts that will enrich your school life by unlocking the last few areas for you to engage with at your leisure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “Isn’t that what I just said?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What you said just didn’t have any finesse,” Monokuma says. “No crackle, no sizzle, no pop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So are you gonna hand it over?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Mononkuma pouts. “Man, you kids really don’t play along, do you? You’re breaking a poor old bear’s heart. I’m not as young as I used to be, you know. I’ve been doing this for so long, and I’m so old, but do kids today respect their elders? Nooooo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re waiting,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sheesh, fine, fine,” he says, waddling over. “I have two presents for you today and the first is,” with a flourish he pulls what looks like a far too large jackhammer looking object for him to plausibly hide behind his back. “The Monokuma Justice-Jackhammer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stands and hesitantly takes it from him. “Tenko will hold on to this,” she says. “And the other item is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma brings his paws to his mouth. “That’s for me to know and you to find out later. Knock yourself out with the hammer first, then try giving your lovely headmaster a ring.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With his cryptic comment, he disappears again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, so,” Tsumugi says after a moment. “Any guesses where,” she gestures vaguely to the object in Tenko’s hands, “something like this would go?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There weren’t any more stairs or closed doors on the top floor, and, well,” Kaito rubs the back of his head. “You use shit like this for digging, right? So we’re going down probably.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think I have a guess,” Ryoma says, shuffling to his feet. “Using crutches has made me realize just how uneven the floor in parts of the school is, and in the entrance hall there’s like definitely an indent that looks like something like that would fit in it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kaede says. “So,” she sends a not so subtle glance in Kaito’s direction, “are we all going?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Course,” Kaito says, pointedly ignoring the look she’s giving him. “Why would anyone stay behind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tears her eyes away. “No reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we should go,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives her a worried look on their way out, but there’s no other communication until they reach the school’s foyer.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito again is the one to speak first, still pretending to be oblivious to everyone walking on eggshells around him. “Ryoma,” he says. “It was somewhere around here, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think so,” Ryoma says as he walks roughly to the middle of the room. “There’s an outline of a hatch or something. Not much but it almost tripped me a few times.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko approaches him, studying the ground intently. “Over here somewhere? Tenko isn’t even sure how to work this thing actually,” she inspects the jackhammer like device. “Mostly because Tenko doesn’t think there’s an on button.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “None of the items Monokuma’s given us before have been normal. Maybe you just… tap it to the hatch thingie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks back at the others for approval before doing as Tsumugi suggested. The object immediately reacts, causing the entire ground in the area Ryoma indicated to fall away into a staircase leading further away. Tenko takes the first few steps down before calling out, “Tenko thinks it’s a tunnel.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, should we—” Tsumugi starts to say before glancing back at Kaito and Ryoma. “Actually, um, are you two okay with stairs?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “My room’s on the second floor of the dorms. ‘Course I can handle stairs.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s voice carries back out to them, “it’s also very dusty down here. Maybe Kaito shouldn’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said I can handle it.” With that, Kaito pushes past Tsumugi to join Tenko in the tunnel.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Tsumugi seems to take a moment to recover from being shoved, Ryoma says, “Might take a while, but I can do it, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma moves slowly, but it’s only a few minutes before their entire little group begins to walk down the relatively undecorated tunnel. “You know,” Kaito says. “I was thinking that it seems like we already have almost everything a school would need and then some extra shit. What other crap could Monokuma have…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The words die in his throat when their path is cut short by a large door with a familiar symbol on it. Kaede’s face is grim as she recognizes what the room is immediately but still tries to the handles she knows are locked anyway. “Not opening,” she says. “Which basically confirms… this is Kokichi’s lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi starts to speak, but Kaede watches Kaito as his fake cheer withers before her eyes. “Um, for every locked talent lab before,” she says. “We always broke in somehow. Admittedly… Kokichi was the person who broke in all three times before, but we could still use—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Forget it,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks like she wants to say more, but Tenko stops her asking, “If we’re done, Tenko can take anyone who wants to back to their room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That,” Kaito turns away from the door, smile back on. “That sounds great, Tenko, but I’m gonna stay here for a while.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Okay, Tenko understands.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but, um,” Tsumugi says. “Didn’t Monokuma say he would give us a second exploration item when we finished here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma shrugs, already turning back the way they came. “Who cares.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is a bit kinder when says, “Tenko thinks that can wait.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yeah, I guess so,” Tsumugi says, and Kaede wonders if the others really can’t see the true cause of her disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Tsumugi starts to retreat with Ryoma and Tenko, Kaede says, “Kaito, I think we should talk. Maybe not right now but soon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito stays quiet, as Tsumugi starts to say, “ah, but Kaede—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Now’s fine,” he says softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede wasn’t expecting that answer, but does her best to not seem caught off guard as she gives him a quick nod. “Okay, we’ll meet up with you guys later then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s face is full of understanding as she leaves. Tsumugi’s face is full of something else, but Kaede looks away before the other girl can notice her staring. She hears Tenko and Ryoma’s footsteps start to fade away and then Tsumugi’s slightly lingering ones a few moments later.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When they disappear almost altogether, Kaito lets out a hollow laugh. “You remember the last time we were exploring, and I yelled at everyone to fuck off? They were driving me crazy, and I was just so fed up that I didn’t want them anywhere near me. And now,” he shakes his head as he shifts to sit propped up against the door. “Now I don’t know. I just kinda feel like an asshole.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You couldn’t have known what would happen,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I should have,” he says. “I thought about it last night when Tenko was lecturing me about killing myself. And then I had an epiphany. All my stupid talk about dying—that’s what made them do it.” He leans his head against the door to stare at the ceiling. “Kokichi said it himself. Maki would be pissed if I died or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede isn’t sure how to respond to that as she joins him on the floor. “And what are you going to do now?” she asks. “Are you still planning to die?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I dunno,” Kaito says. “Well, actually I do know that pretty soon it’s not gonna be my choice anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hugs her knees to her chest. “That,” she says. “That really sucks.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says. “It does.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They’re both quiet for a while before Kaito says, “I should’ve said this when everyone was here, but… I’m sorry for acting like a piece of shit at the trial. And for punching you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s okay—I don’t think anyone really blames you for that,” Kaede says. “At least I don’t anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you talking about the trial or the punch?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The trial,” Kaede says. “And I’ll forgive you for the punch when my bruise is gone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He snorts, “hey that’s the one you’re supposed to not care about. You slapped me first, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah,” Kaede says. “But I always assumed you were one of those guys who has, like, a thing against sucker punching girls. And pulling their hair."</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “You’re pretty tough—I figured you could take it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that why?” Kaede asks wryly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eh,” he sighs. “It’s better than the truth. And—what was it—gentle lies aren’t all that bad, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” she says. “Think I remember someone saying that a few times.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito smiles as he shakes his head. “I was horrible to him, you know. I still don’t know why he decided I was his favorite or whatever way back, but I hated it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I remember that,” Kaede says. “I think he said it was because so many of the guys had died, and Ryoma and Gonta were pretty attached to each other already… and he always had a thing against Kiibo.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He told me about that actually,” Kaito says. “He literally thought Kiibo was suspicious because he was a robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “So he was robophobic, after all. And when did you guys talk about that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shrugs. “Don’t remember. He told me a lot of things. Even when I thought he was one of the most annoying people I had ever met, he would just come bug me and tell me all this shit and then play it off like he was lying. I still don’t know how much of it was true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh,” Kaede says. “I never really imagined Kokichi as the kind of person to want to share.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess.” Kaito runs a hand through his hair. “God, a guy fucking dies for you and you still don’t know where you stand with him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He liked you,” Kaede says. “I think he was just trying to mess you with at first, but after… you tried to kill him…” she looks over to Kaito shaking his head. “What happened with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you I’d tell you that story at some point, didn’t I? Well,” he sighs. “You and Maki kept saying all this stuff about killing the mastermind and I just—I thought I had to do something. I couldn’t let myself be the only one doing nothing, or at least that’s what it felt like.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get that,” Kaede says. “And I’m sorry if I pushed you into it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says. “Don’t apologize. It was my stupid choice. And… just thinking about it as soon as Miu said all that crap about dying in her virtual world fucked me up. But I still went through with it for, like, five seconds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kokichi said something similar,” Kaede says. “Then he said you got down on your knees and begged him for forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito snorts. “‘Course he’d say something like that. But no, I shoved him against a bookshelf, and it wasn’t that hard but he yelped like he was in pain and fell to the floor… and I lost my nerve completely.” He rubs the back of his head. “I froze, and he started saying a bunch of stuff that I barely heard. I was just too freaked out by what I had done. But I do remember him saying… ‘you can’t do this, you’re not a killer, you’re not going to do this’ or something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he was right,” Kaede says. “You’re not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I didn’t realize how right he was until he was literally saying it,” Kaito says. “And then, uh, that whole ‘begging for forgiveness’ shit he told you isn’t… too far from the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede quirks an eyebrow. “You didn’t actually get down on your hands and knees, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaito says with a short laugh. “But I just could not stop saying I was sorry. I had no idea what the hell else to do, so I just kept saying it over and over again and I think it kinda freaked him out. He…” Kaito trails off, looking somewhere off into the distance in the empty hallway. “He literally calmed me down from my own murder attempt. And I just felt like shit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then you logged out, and Maki was coming for him, right?” Kaede prompts.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods. “Yeah. Sounds terrible but part of me was almost thankful when I realized what she was trying to do. I mean, it was still shit because I didn’t want Maki to kill anyone, but… I could do something to make up for what I did. Which is also why I announced in front of everyone that I was gonna protect him, and, well,” he lets out a self deprecating laugh. “Did a fucking great job of that, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it makes you feel better,” Kaede says. “I don’t think Kokichi’s the kind of person that would ever just let himself get protected.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably, and,” Kaito says, “I think all this shit has taught me I kinda suck at being a hero. Kokichi and Maki did what they did to save me, and now Tenko’s having to take care of me all the time…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hugs her knees a little closer. “Hey, Kaito, I think I said this before, but I meant it when I said you’re a better person than me. I’m not sure if I was jealous exactly but I just… I didn’t get—and I still don’t—how you can be so patient and so forgiving to people who just… don’t seem to deserve it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito smirks at her. “I know you’re just saying that to make me feel better—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s true,” Kaede says. “Even when Kokichi and I were on the same side, I know he still hated me and I hated him, and I thought that was just the way it was. But then I would remember how you could actually talk to him, and… I don’t understand. Maybe I just don’t have that much faith in people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He goes quiet for a moment, looking her over before saying, “maybe it’s about faith. I never really thought about it. I guess I just don’t believe completely irredeemable people exist.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kaede says. “I don’t know if I could think that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A lot of people don’t,” Kaito says. “Maki thought she was hopeless. Like, it was too late for her to ever actually choose her own path. I don’t know what Kokichi thought about himself. Sometimes he seemed so full of himself and others he’d say all this crap about how his life didn’t matter. Like, as soon as we got back to my room after Kiibo died, he was the one who came up with this plan for us to lie about what I tried to do to him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think I get how a person can be so nonchalant about their own death either,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses for a second. “I’ve been thinking about that, too. He was so fine with dying, and I’m not sure if that made what happened better or worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hesitates for a moment as well before she finally says, “actually, I think I do understand… being prepared. When we went to the first trial, I thought that was it for me. I was really scared, but I had already decided to go through with it. But if something happened, and I was to die now,” she sighs. “I don’t know about that. I guess you change your mind when it seems less real, if that makes sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito nods. “Yeah, it does. I told myself before that dying was impossible because I had so much other shit I wanted to do, but now I think I just want it to be on my own terms. If I can decide, I’d pick literally anything over just letting myself get killed for this fucked up game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know we had a trial for them, but,” Kaede says. “I think Maki and Kokichi felt the same way. At least… Kokichi implied it, but he kind of has a hard time just saying what he means.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito smiles. “Oh yeah. It was so annoying, and I think he was really fucking proud of that, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He did seem to get a kick out of confusing us,” Kaede says. “By the way, did you ever figure out why he had Maki ask you to get weird stuff from Miu’s lab like Kiibo’s head?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito shakes his head. “No, and there was more than just that. There was, like, that and then a small power cell, some tools, and then some other crap from Kiibo’s lab. I don’t get it, but… I still haven’t read the note he gave me yet.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you not want to do it when Tenko was there?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “I just… I don’t think I could have handled reading something they wrote knowing they were gonna die last night, but,” he shifts and pulls a familiar looking folded piece of paper from his coat pocket, “I was planning on trying to do it today.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can leave you alone if you want,” Kaede offers.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito pauses, fiddling with the paper before he finally says, “you can stay if you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before Kaede can say another word, he unfolds the paper, and she sees cramped handwriting filling up the first half of the page with a few doodles running along the margins.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s grip on the paper tightens slightly, and Kaede has to inch closer to make out the words herself. It says:</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">‘Kaito—<br>
I’m writing this in the middle of the night, and I doubt I will have slept before or after its completion. Any errors are due to my own lack of sleep, and I hope they do not interfere with the point I want to make.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I’m writing to you because, while I have never cared what the others thought of me as long as I achieved what I needed to, I wouldn’t feel right leaving you unanswered. I also know that I have only found the resolve to do this because of you. You know my history—I’m used to fighting in someone else’s place, but that’s not what this is about.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I think I didn’t want to think I counted as a person anymore because it would make me too angry. If I was a person, then what happened to me wasn’t right. But in the killing game, we were all people—you kept telling me that over and over—and we were being treated like weapons. You said I was free to make my own path now because I wasn’t with the people controlling me anymore—I didn’t have to be afraid of hurting anyone anymore.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But that wasn’t true. I just went from one owner to another. The mastermind was using me as a weapon just like the people who trained me to be this way. But I didn’t want to be tricked or used anymore. I wanted to think for myself and find a different solution. I don’t know if I did what I did because I wanted to save or protect anyone. I just know when I saw the Flashback Light, I knew it was too convenient, and I knew it was designed to manipulate me. I knew the mastermind was trying to use me, and I knew I was too angry to keep doing nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Killing is still the only thing I know how to do right, and the person I’m killing is myself. I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promise to you.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I’m also glad I was able to fight in your place to stop the time limit. I know you never listen to me but do what you can to survive.<br>
—</span><span class="s5">Maki</span><span class="s1"> Harumaki’</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks up at Kaito when she finishes, but he doesn’t seem to acknowledge her presence, already focused on the next section. Kaede glances back down to it, seeing Kokichi’s familiar childish handwriting scrawling over the rest of the page.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">‘My dearest, darling Kaito,</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I hope whatever Harumaki-chan wrote didn’t bore you too much. I know I fell asleep halfway through reading it, so I can’t imagine what it’d be like for someone with your attention span. And since Harumaki-chan and I decided I should do the trial (can you imagine her trying to pretend to be me???), I get to see the note last so I know my wonderful drawings made it a little less boring for you~</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">But anyway! I promise only some of this will be lies. Which parts are true are left for you to figure out~</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And also I’m dead! I wrote all this with the intention of handing it off to you if I wasn’t going to make it, and I have a pretty good feeling that’s going to be the case. Don’t worry though! I knew this would happen as soon as I agreed to stay behind in the hanger. And this way you have Kaede with you, too! She kinda sucks, but you guys are friends so get her to say something comforting.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And if you do get a chance, tell Kaede she’s a nosy, murder-y, busybody, buuut at the end of the day she wasn’t really that boring. Sometimes you’re not boring either! Most of the time you are, but other times you do things that no one’s ever done before like have expectations for me or say you believe in me or act like we’re friends.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">You’re a weird guy, Kaito! But I guess that’s also what makes you less boring, so keep being weird. But not like really stupidly, naively, suicidally weird. Just the regular kind. But what do I know? I am dead, after all.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also I still don’t get why you like Harumaki-chan. She’s soooo annoying and whiney. Do you just like difficult people, Kaito? Are you like a masochist or something? I know I said to be weird but not like that, geeeeeze. But that’s okay. If my beloved’s into it then I guess I can deal~</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I guess now I should end with one last thing to say to you and for you to remember me always. You’re </span><span class="s5">dumb</span><span class="s1"> annoying a lot and look like </span><span class="s5">an idiot</span><span class="s1"> a circus clown, but you’re an okay guy and it was nice while it lasted.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Loooooove,<br>
Your superior, Great Supreme Ruler, King of this World, and Best Person You Will Ever Meet, Kokichi Oma’</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but roll her eyes at the way Kokichi signs off his letter, but between the weird drawings and random insults at her, she thinks she gets what he was trying to convey in his own unique way.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito just keeps staring it, though Kaede sees his eyes stop moving after a few moments when she finishes. Hesitantly, she places a hand on his shoulder. “Kaito,” she says. “How are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine,” he mumbles. “‘m fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t shrug her off, however, and Kaede stays where she is. They sit in silence for a few moments, and Kaede lets her eyes wander back over the note, glancing at Kokichi’s doodles or rereading certain lines.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then Kaito says, “Kaede,” and he points to the place in Kokichi’s section where he mentions how annoying Maki is. “What does that say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares in confusion for a second before realizing his finger is actually directed towards a blurry scribble right below the line Kaede thought he was pointing to. She narrows her eyes and realizes it does seem like more than one of Kokichi’s regular writing flourishes. “I’m not sure,” she says. “Can I see it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito hands it over to her but hunches over her shoulder to keep looking for himself. “I think it’s letters.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede brings the paper closer to her face, squinting even more at the tiny message. “I think you’re right,” she says. Then, she tries turning it over, and the letters come into slightly better focus. “It says…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She spends another second studying it, and Kaito finds the answer first, murmuring, “‘the other Exisal…’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Kaede asks. “The other Exisal is still in the hanger, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says, slightly breathless. “I think… we should check that out right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mind flickers briefly to her plan with Tsumugi before she stands. “Okay, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They walk briskly, and Kaede can’t quite tell if they should bother with trying to hide what they’re doing at all. Kaito has a determined look on his face that doesn’t falter even when he starts to wince at the exertion their long walk must have on him by the end of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">At the hanger’s entrance, the previously used electrohammer is still lying outside the gate, and Kaede picks it up. “The charge is back,” she says. “I can knock down the barrier whenever you’re ready.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do it now,” Kaito says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, and as she approaches the barrier, she hears footsteps echoing behind them and Tenko’s voice calling out, “Kaede! Kaito! Monokuma told us to come right—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede swings the hammer before she can finish and the barrier collapses. Kaito darts forward to pull open the gate, and as the others round the corner, Monokuma pops up to start shouting. “Now just what do you kids think you’re—Eep!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He disappears as soon as he had come as the spot he had been standing on suddenly gets riddled with bullets. The remaining purple Exisal jerks forward, its guns still smoking. Maki says, “Find cover. This place is about to become a war zone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can only gape at the sight before her while Kaito says, “Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The monitor over head turns on. “Ahem, attention!” Monokuma growls. “Any and all naughty students who should be dead are now going to be executed! Resistance will not be tolerated nor will trying to assist in—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The screen turns to static and after a second, Kiibo’s face appears. “Everyone, please do not be alarmed!” he says. “I have accessed the school’s cameras, and I am afraid you are all in danger—there is a tank currently outside the dorms that I believe Monokuma is piloting with the intent to shoot to kill.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede still finds processing any of the sudden information in front of her too monumental a task when the Exisal’s cockpit opens with a soft click. Maki is sitting there calmly, a few futuristic looking guns, other mechanical parts, and Kiibo’s head piled in the cramped space with her. “I’ll explain later,” she says. “But right now we need to move fast.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stammers. “H-Maki? How can you be alive? You were—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do we need to do?” Kaito asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki turns to him, and though her face remains as impassive as ever, something bright flickers in her normally cold eyes. “We need,” she says, reaching over to grab Kiibo’s head. “To send a message—one the mastermind can’t manipulate. And,” she looks over the others, “I’m going to need at least a few of you to help me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever you need,” Kaito says immediately. “Maki, I’ll do any—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” she says. “But it’s more than one person can handle.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Can’t run, but I’ll do what I can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko sends a quick nervous look to Kaede before saying, “Tenko will try to help, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi just shakes her head, mumbling to herself, “What is going on? How can this be happening?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steps forward. She stares hard at Maki, and straightens her shoulders. “What’s the plan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“To put is simply,” Maki says, “we show the audience exactly how much the mastermind’s game has failed. We’re going to contact them directly and tell them this killing game—every killing game—is over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And some people probably saw this twist coming, too, haha. Though I feel the need to say there's at least a few more tricks I have planned that will also be coming up soon!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki speaks fast as she tosses the supplies she had been hoarding in the Exisal to them. Tenko catches Kiibo’s head easily enough as Maki explains, “getting a signal of our own set up is easier than you might think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really?” Ryoma says. “Because I was thinking that means something along the lines of us trying to figure out how to even establish a radio signal, bypass whatever Monokuma’s system, and do both those things while under tank fire, apparently.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi wrings her hands. “So—wait, um—how is it easier than we think then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s easier because it’s actually possible,” Maki replies.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do we need to do then?” Kaito asks. “You say the word and I’ll get it—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re staying here where it’s safe,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito frowns. “I’m not about to just sit on my ass doing nothing while you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m going to hold Monokuma off for as long as possible,” Maki says. “For now, I should be his only target, but if he begins to suspect what we’re up to, then he’ll change his focus to you guys if he’s smart.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what exactly are we doing that’s going to make him want to blow us up?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki nods towards Kiibo’s head in Tenko’s hands. “The mastermind wasn’t the only one broadcasting at the beginning—Kiibo also had the same abilities, though I doubt he was aware of them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can assure you I was not,” Kiibo says from his screen overhead.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki barely pays his interruption any heed as she continues. “Miu said most of his body was scrap metal because his A.I. could no longer connect to it, but his head still contains a working camera and an antenna. Tenko—you’re going to go to Kiibo’s lab and use what you can to get a signal set up there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks she can do that,” Tenko says. “Though… she’s not very good with computers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“None of us are, but we have to make due,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m good with computers,” Kaito says. “If you let me—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said no,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “And what about the rest of us? Is this the only thing you need to do to really end the game? Are we sure there’s not anymore secrets the mastermind’s hiding from us?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have no idea,” Maki says. “But the mastermind doesn’t matter if we can go over their head. However,” she turns to Kaede. “If everyone goes to Kiibo’s lab, it won’t take Monokuma long to figure out that it’s important. Kaede, Ryoma—you investigate the school. If I get the chance, I’ll blow up the door in the library, which should at least distract Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Makes sense,” Ryoma says. “Just don’t blow us up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki nods. “I’ll see what I can manage. Tsumugi—you go with Tenko. The two of you are the only ones who would be able to run in case Monokuma starts targeting you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, I’ll try my best then,” Tsumugi agrees, her hesitation clear.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, but what about me?” Kaito asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki snaps to face him. “You’re staying here where it’s safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito lets out a frustrated sigh. “I already told you I’m not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaede keeps a hesitant eye on Tsumugi blending in even as she addresses Maki. “How did you figure all this stuff out?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki lets whatever argument she was about to begin with Kaito drop immediately. “We don’t have time for me to explain everything, but Kokichi and Miu did most of it. I suspected the mastermind was manipulating us and then compared notes with Kokichi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And this was the plan you came up with?” Kaito asks. “Kokichi dies, and you—what the hell happens after we establish this signal and tell whoever’s watching that Monokuma’s full of shit? What happens to you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki crosses her arms, the easiness that had been present in her speech when giving orders vanishing. “I go to Kiibo’s lab, tell the audience I’m alive and that the killing game is broken. And then…” she sighs. “We hope that’s enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Enough to convince Monokuma to cancel the game?” Kaede asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sighs. “As far as I can tell, there are two outcomes. The game ends here either way if Monokuma’s audience loses faith in him and isn’t interested anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But those two outcomes,” Tsumugi says. “Are they either Monokuma lets us all go or… he just decides to kill us all?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And if this plan fails,” Tsumugi says. “Then we die anyway, right? We’ll be breaking the no violence against the headmaster rule.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks we should still try,” Tenko says. “We either stay together or we return to the killing game, and Tenko refuses to let that happen. And also, if we pass up an opportunity to end the game, then… then Tenko thinks that’s an insult to everyone who has died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito presses his fists together. “Took the words right out of my mouth. Let’s make Kokichi’s death mean something. He sacrificed himself for us to have this opportunity, and I’m not about to let it got to waste.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sounds like we’re all in agreement, then,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches Tsumugi out of the corner of her eye before she responds, “We are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaito says. “I still have one problem.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not letting you put yourself in danger,” Maki says. “I don’t care if it hurts your pride or if you’re going to spend the rest of our lives complaining about it. You’re not getting yourself killed now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not gonna get myself killed,” Kaito says. “All I want is to finally fulfill my promise, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow. “Promise?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I said I would protect Kokichi, and if I can,” Kaito presses his fists together, a determined look spreading over his face. “I want to at least protect what he sacrificed his life for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki stares hard at him for a long moment while Tenko breathes out, “Kaito…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki keeps watching him before sighing and grabbing what looks to Kaede like a strange futuristic bazooka like object before hoping out of the Exisal. Despite its heavy appearance, Maki holds the weapon with ease to the point of being able to casually gesture to the Exisal’s now open cockpit while wielding it with one hand. “You’ll be safer in the Exisal. Monokuma’s other weapons will do a lot of damage, but it’s better than nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito can’t pilot that!” Tenko says. “His hands are too—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaito says. “It’ll be fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko frowns. “Kaito, with your current motor skills and deteriorating health, there’s no way—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can handle it,” he says. “I know you’ve been taking care of me this whole time, and I appreciate that, but just… trust me, alright? This is something I need to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko still seems upset, but her only protest is to shake her head. “Maybe you’re not awful, but after all this time, you’re still just a reckless boy, aren’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito grins at her as he mounts the Exisal to sit inside. “You know it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma turns to Maki. “So are you just going to run around unprotected?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am,” Maki says. “But that’s fine. Stealth and dodging are my specialties anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, right,” Tsumugi says. “I mean, you are the Ultimate Assassin and not the Ultimate… Mecha Pilot, I guess?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But won’t you be really exposed like that?” Kaede asks. “And you’re the one Monokuma’s aiming for, too—not Kaito.” Maki’s eyes flicker over to her as Kaede continues. “And if you die before Tenko can set up the broadcast, then… then we fail, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says. “I know, and I have no intentions to die before the plan is accomplished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, yeah, I would hope so,” Kaede says. “But whether you intend it or not, doesn’t really matter if Monokuma gets a lucky shot or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki nods. “I’m aware, but that isn’t going to happen. I’ve trained my whole life for missions like this—I’m not about to fail when I’m finally fighting for myself.” Kaede still frowns at her response, and Maki says, “trust me,” before readying her weapon in her hands and starting to stalk down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Guess we’re starting then, huh?” Ryoma says, prompting the others to start following after her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We are,” Maki says. “Kaito—you go out first. If Kiibo’s been doing his job then Monokuma ideally won’t know it’s not me in the Exisal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got it,” Kaito says before pulling the Exisal’s cockpit door closed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You won’t have to be a decoy for long,” Maki says. “Just long enough to allow me to run to cover and potentially fire a shot or two off. After that… just try not to do anything you know will get yourself killed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can hear the grin in Kaito’s voice even through the Exisal’s speakers. “No promises.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki rolls her eyes as she continues. “Everyone else run to your positions as soon as Monokuma’s focus turns to us—Kaede and Ryoma go first to make Monokuma think we’re interested in the school. Tenko, Tsumugi—you head to Kiibo’s lab when his focus isn’t on you. The longer your position stays secret, the better chance we have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, that all sounds fine,” Kaede says. “But what about the mastermind? They’re still one of us, and they could still potentially sabotage something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They don’t matter,” Maki says. “If you find them, kill them. But if we don’t, then it doesn’t matter. Their death would be a benefit, but it’s not necessary.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not?” Tsumugi asks. “But aren’t they the one keeping us trapped here?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede eyes her warily as Maki answers, not breaking her stride for a second. “Yes, but that doesn’t mean killing them will do anything. They wanted us to believe that so we would turn on each other, but,” from her place a few paces back, Kaede sees something in Maki’s shoulders tighten. “You can’t end a killing game with more killing. It doesn’t work that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Ryoma says. “And you say it ends with… a message.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A message,” Maki says. “And refusal. If you participate in the game at all, then you’ve already lost.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And a lot of us got close to that,” Kaito says, voice echoing from his place in the Exisal. “Damn. That’s… hard to think about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So that’s why Kokichi let himself be wrongly executed?” Tsumugi asks. “To protest the game? O-Oh, and Maki, um, while we still have a minute just… how did you and Kokichi, you know, fake your death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki glances back at her, and Kaede thinks she isn’t going to respond at all until she pauses briefly to pull up the sleeve on her shirt. Underneath, Kaede sees tight wrappings of gauze. “We both gave what we could,” Maki says. “There had to be enough blood to be convincing, and the paint from the Exisal machine helped to supplement it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Kaede feels herself pale at the sight. “You both…” she shivers involuntarily at the thought.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Maki says. “The excuse of cleaning the press allowed us to get away with using less than would have been believable, and the smell of the chemicals disguised the scent of the paint.” She pulls her sleeve back down. “Kokichi thought of the second part of the plan. He didn’t have the constitution not to use some sort of trick.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t think many people would,” Tenko mumbles under her breath.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki shrugs as she resumes walking. “We both knew our strengths. Kokichi could do the trial, and I can do this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito laughs. “Would be kinda hard to image Kokichi running around shooting lazers at Monokuma, though he’d probably have a pretty good time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki goes quiet for a brief moment as Kaede registers her eyes flickering to Kaito. “You keep calling him—” she cuts herself off with a shake of her head and focuses her gaze back ahead of them as she continues. “Kaito, at the trial, Kokichi… didn’t say anything stranger than normal to you, did he? Anything about you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Kaito says. “I don’t think so. Why? Was he supposed to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says, stoically as ever. “I just wanted to check if he kept that part of our deal.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaito says. “What dea—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re here,” Maki interrupts as they reach the machinery bay’s exit. “Kaito, are you ready?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think so,” he says. “Hey, Kiibo, you know where Monokuma is?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">One of the ever prominent monitors overhead flickers on. “He is still in the main courtyard, though it appears he has set up an ambush or a barricade of some sort at the top of the stairs,” Kiibo says. “I suggest extreme caution in attempting any engagement, particularly due to Monokuma holding the high ground.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He has the high ground?” Tsumugi echoes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Does… that matter?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not if Kaito’s a good enough distraction,” Maki says. She looks up to nod towards him. “Whenever you’re ready.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Got it,” he says before turning to the others. “Well, I’ll see you guys again when we’re getting the hell out of here, you got that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s goodbye sends a strange feeling through Kaede’s chest, and as she glances around at her remaining classmates, the reality of physically going into battle hits her. “Right,” she says, even as she can’t help but feel an aching sense of dread as she lies. “We’ll all meet up then, and we’re all going to escape,” and she can’t help as her gaze drifts to Tsumugi as she finishes, “together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito says something in affirmation back, but Kaede keeps looking at Tsumugi standing passively as ever, somehow fading into the background in such a small group. Then the doors leading to the lower courtyard open, and Kaito charges out.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Maki’s voice echo out of the Exisal’s speakers challenging Monokuma to come fight her face to face. The real Maki rolls her eyes at the bad impression and turns to the others to give one last warning of, “Monokuma doesn’t really want to hurt any of you—do what you can but don’t put yourself between him and me. That’s the only situation where I doubt he would hesitate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay,” Kaede says. “And… you survive, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives her an odd look. “We’ll see.” Then she slips out without another word.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A few moments pass, then the ringing of explosions sounding in the distance carries back to them. The monitor flickers back to Kiibo’s face, and he says, “Kaede, Ryoma, you should head out now. Monokuma will need to see you for your misdirect to work, but also be careful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’ll do what we can,” Ryoma says to him before looking up at Kaede. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a sudden surge of nerves at the idea of leaving Tenko alone with Tsumugi and the most important aspect of their plan. Tenko seems to pick up on the first part of her worry from her gaze and replies, “Tenko will be okay. She promises.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede forces herself to smile back. “Alright. Just watch your back, okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She sees Tsumugi’s mouth quirk the slightest bit into a frown as Tenko responds, “Tenko will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives the two girls a last measured look before turning back to Ryoma. He nods and starts to head outside.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are no immediate visual signs of the battle on their first few steps, but as they near the stairs, the sounds of ricocheting bullets increases. As they begin to mount the stairs, Ryoma says, “I might slow you down. Don’t worry about running if you need to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s mouth presses into a tight line. “If you want me to leave you behind, that’s not going to happen, and you’re not going to talk me into sacrificing you for no reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shrugs. “Fine. Just saying, it’d be pointless for both of us to die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one’s going to die,” Kaede says, more out of habit than anything else.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t falter in his movements even as he says, “you don’t really believe that, do you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They finish mounting the stairs in silence with a few explosions providing enough background noise to give Kaede the excuse of not responding. At the top, Kaede sees the tank Kiibo had described as well as a few more Monokuma themed military artillery. Kaito appears to be keeping the Exisal in constant motion, strafing to the side as a missile rockets past where he had been positioned seconds ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s low to the ground in the bushes, and Kaede watches her as she steadies her weapon with the luxury being hidden allows. The lazer that shoots out of what Kaede had thought had been a rocket launcher is near blinding and strikes what looks like a Monokuma patterned attack helicopter head on. Though it’s still distant, the following explosion and careening helicopter shake Kaede, and she pulls Ryoma to run faster after her. He hisses as he lands on his injured leg wrong but otherwise doesn’t protest.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps running without looking back. She hears the helicopter crash to the ground and the sound of the lazer going off again. Monokuma’s screaming something over what sounds like an intercom, and Kaito shouts at Maki to move in his own voice. It’s all Kaede can do to block out the noises of their battle in favor of listening to ensure that Ryoma is right behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They make it to taking cover behind the dorms that look like they’ve taken a beating, giving Ryoma a chance to recover before their next dash. Kaede spares another look at the battle. Maki’s somehow even faster than when she had dodged the Exisals back in the hanger. Kaito’s covering fire is the only thing distracting Monokuma as Maki darts over the scorched ground of the former schoolyard, pausing for seconds to get a clear shot before darting away again, whatever spot she had been standing in being turned into a crater the moment she leaves it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though Kaede never answered Ryoma’s question, she bites the inside of her cheek as she thinks the answer.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">What she does mutter aloud is, “I thought Kiibo said he stopped Monokuma from making more of himself…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe he was wrong,” Ryoma says. “Or maybe they came from somewhere else. Mean, I’ve never seen a helicopter or a tank lying around the school before.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They came from outside…” Kaede says. “There’s a place outside the school making more Monokumas.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t seem great for us,” Ryoma says. “Also,” he nods towards the tank suddenly shifting position to head closer to them. “Think we should move.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a sudden jolt of fear that propels her forward. Distantly, she hears Kiibo’s voice echo, “Kaede! Ryoma! Monokuma sees you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In this sprint, Kaede has no idea if Ryoma’s behind her—any chance of hearing his footsteps made impossible even for her over the sound of Kaito’s bullets splattering against the side of Monokuma’s tank. Hearing the gunshots at close range is a completely different experience from before as each noise explodes and echoes as it screeches against the metal. And all of that is nothing to the sound of the dorms crumbling to the ground.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The school in front of her has taken a beating as well, though it’s still standing strong enough that Kaede forces herself to keep running even as pain jolts up through her leg. It’s only when she tears open the front doors does she pause to see Ryoma only a few feet behind her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma seems to have gained more interest in attempting to fire at Maki easily dodging his shoots in the newly created rubble. Kaede has little love lost for her room in what was essentially a prison, but seeing it destroyed so easily hammers home the finality of their actions, as does the debris now scattered around the damaged school building.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She waits just long enough for Ryoma to push past her into the school before slamming the doors shut as if such an action would stop a rocket from ripping them to shreds. Ryoma pauses only for a moment to collect himself before asking, “So—what do we do now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaede says. “Search for clues? Or at least pretend to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Any ideas where to start in our imaginary search then?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tugs at her hat. “I… can search the basement if you’ll take this floor. Maybe Kiibo can open the secret room or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you think I’m gonna find anything here?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Kaede says. “It’s less you finding something and more… how do I put this—Monokuma deciding it’s okay to reveal a hint.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her an odd look. “You think Monokuma’s about to give us a helping hand now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think…” Kaede says. “I think we should think about what Monokuma wants, and I don’t know that he wants us to lose. He just wants us to keep playing the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So if Monokuma tries to show me something,” Ryoma says. “Ignoring him is the best route.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know about that either,” she says. “Just… use your best judgment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods and starts to walk away from her. “Sure thing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, wait Ryoma,” Kaede calls after him. “Also—you know—stay safe.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He looks back at her over his shoulder with a slight smile. “I will if you will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though it’s not the most reassuring sentiment in words alone, Kaede feels a certain camaraderie in his tone that allows her to begin her first steps towards her goal somehow optimistic.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The battle outside makes it hard to discern specific noises as Kaede makes her way towards the basement, though when she feels secure enough in the distance, she pulls Miu’s monopad from her backpack. “Hey, Kiibo, can you still talk to me through this? I need to ask you something privately.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She descends a few more steps on the stairs leading down when the monopad flickers on. “Hello, Kaede,” Kiibo says. “It appears I still do have a connection to this monopad, at least.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Appears?’” Kaede repeats. “You mean you weren’t sure?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m afraid not. In fact—” Kiibo abruptly cuts himself off, instead saying, “Never mind. There’s no need to trouble you with that now. Kaede, what did you want to ask me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, okay?” Kaede says. “I just wanted to ask you to keep an eye on Tenko and let her know if Tsumugi’s about to… sneak up on her or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is no need to worry about that,” Kiibo says. “I have already been doing so, as I am currently in contact with her as well giving her directions on how to proceed with Maki’s task. However, it appears Tsumugi is not a problem, actually, as she is leaving my lab right at this moment.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “What? Where is she going?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Here, I believe,” Kiibo says. “Though it will likely take her some time to make it through the battlefield. Things are becoming… increasingly dangerous as we speak.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As if summoned by his words, Kaede hears another particularly loud explosion echoing a bit too close to her for comfort. “Is it safer or more dangerous if I go to the basement?” she asks more to herself than to Kiibo.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He debates her question for a second anyway before answering, “it is less likely you will be directly impacted by any missiles or debris, however, you will be putting yourself in a situation with only one exit. In the event the stairs become blocked or potentially destroyed—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll be trapped—I got it,” Kaede says. “Anyway, Kiibo, I was going to ask if it’s possible for you to maybe open the library door in the basement, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She trails off, and Kiibo prompts, “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess I can just ask Tsumugi to open it when she gets here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo doesn’t seem to like that answer, but simply says, “I suppose that is one option, though I am unsure about trusting in her cooperation.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’ll be okay,” Kaede says. “I don’t think she has any intentions of stopping me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The image of Kiibo’s face presses his mouth into a tight line, emoting his suspicion even as a projection of an A.I. “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede enters the relatively undisturbed library as she says, “Anyway, what was it you were going to tell me? I think we have a second before Tsumugi shows up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is true, however,” he says. “I do not know if you need to be burdened with this information at this time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I want to hear it,” Kaede says. “And that’s what this fake search is about anyway—finding the last few pieces of information.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… logically is true,” Kiibo says, and he the tension in his voice changes Kaede’s attitude from curious to worried. “This unfortunately is… difficult for me to come to terms with, though I understand that the situation is what it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that situation is?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo pauses for another moment before saying, “To save my life, Miu uploaded me into her monopad and allowed me to gain access to the school’s system as a whole. My original software was strangely compatible enough to enable such a thing in the first place, but I have some to realize something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that something is bad, isn’t it?” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For me it is,” Kiibo says. “I believe that due to my current condition, I cannot survive beyond the confines of the school’s network. Even if the monopad was to be taken outside, as soon as it loses the school’s signal—whether by distance, the school’s network being shut down at the game’s finish, or the school’s destruction—I will not be able to function.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s grip on the monopad tightens. “You can’t leave?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says. “I also am not sure if this makes this finding better or worse, but from my investigation, I believe I was never able to. Destroying the school or leaving its confines—both will be the end for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That can’t be true,” Kaede says. “Or there has to be some other way. We’ll just figure out a way to put you on some other network—that’s what contacting the outside world is going to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Kiibo says. “Maybe you misunderstood—I was compatible with the school’s network. I… have come to the conclusion that I was created for this game. When the game ends, whoever is in charge of it will shut me down along with everything else that had been keeping it running.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I said you could escape with the broadcast or whatever,” Kaede says. “You just have to use that and then you’ll be free, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo smiles. “I appreciate the thought, but… I’m afraid it doesn’t quite work that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares down at him, feeling herself at a loss. “Why are you giving up? Why are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ve made my peace,” he says. “I want to do everything in my power to assist you all in escaping, and… Perhaps this is irrational of me to say, but even though I do not know where an entity such as myself will go after my death, if I could choose, I think I would like to see Miu and everyone else.” Kiibo hesitates for just a moment before he says, “And I will tell them we all made it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” Kaede says. “I think you should. And I think that will happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m glad,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But I still don’t think you should just give up on yourself, either,” Kaede insists.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already said it’s not as simple as that,” Kiibo says. “I am not giving up, but rather… I’m accepting what I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “What are you talking about? You hate it whenever we would call you a robot or point it out or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Me being a robot is neither here nor there,” Kiibo says. “I could be a person and what I have found would likely still be true. I’m not… real.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Uh,” Kaede says. “No? You are. I know you’re a computer program, but I’m talking to you right now. And how could you be not real if you were a person?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The full answer to that is complicated,” Kiibo says slowly, measuring his words as he speaks. “But I have found from my investigations information to prove that I was an entity created solely for this game. So when I say I can’t exist outside of the game… I mean that in a few ways.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You were created for the game?” Kaede echoes at the same time she hears the front doors to the library creak open. Kiibo seems to be on the verge of saying something else to her, but she quickly cuts him off with, “Sorry, gotta go,” as she sees Tsumugi peek her head in through the door.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t listen to Kiibo’s last protest, shoving him into her bag as she nods at Tsumugi to step forward to meet her. Tsumugi does so, only saying, “Ryoma is somewhere else, I presume?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He should be on the ground floor or maybe upstairs,” Kaede says. “We’re searching for nothing so I don’t know what he’s doing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says, walking past her towards the secret door. “He’s searching for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi presses on the shelf to cause it to swing back, revealing the door, and with just as much nonchalance she takes a cardkey from her pocket and runs it through the card reader.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The door makes a slight clicking sound before retreating into the walls to open before them. Tsumugi steps to the side, saying, “After you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Actually,” Kaede says. “I think you should go first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles as she shakes her head. “I already told you, Kaede. I have no intentions of killing you or anyone else right now. Well,” she sighs as she tucks a strand of hair behind her ear. “Anyone besides Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but smirk at her. “You weren’t expecting that, were you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “And she needs to die before the final trial. I’m a reasonable person, and you know I’m willing to compromise on a lot of things, but this is not negotiable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you’re just going to kill her?” Kaede says. “And what about the broadcast to your audience? You were alone with Tenko, but you didn’t sabotage it, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ideally, Maki will be dead before Tenko can accomplish anything, even with Kiibo talking her through it,” Tsumugi answers. “Killing or hurting Tenko or outing myself by doing something now would just make things worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, trying to piece together the information before her. “So you’re just going to let Monokuma handle it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“For now,” Tsumugi says. “Kaito jumping into things is a pain since blowing him up wouldn’t be ideal, so Monokuma’s a bit handcuffed at the moment, but,” she shrugs. “We’ll see. Anyway,” she begins to head into the room. “Are you coming, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a second, taking in the fact that she’s heading into the mastermind’s lair, practically holding hands with its owner. “Yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The room that greets her is familiar. Tsumugi doesn’t bother with any guiding words, instead hurrying off to pull a tarp off of what Kaede recognizes is the Mother Monokuma. It starts babbling to Tsumugi about the grand reveal still being messed up, while Kaede stares at it in shock.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This is…” Kaede says. “This is the room that connects to the girls’ bathroom.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “I cannot believe you and Miu found it so fast. And then Miu thought she was so clever coming down here to install Kiibo into the system…” she shakes her head. “I cannot describe how much of a pain that was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think it was a pain!” the Mother Monokuma barks. “Think of what I’ve gone through! Having some brat rooting around in my system, shutting off my ability to make Monokumas, separating me from my precious Nanokumas—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Can you not contact them at all?” Tsumugi asks. “I need you to deliver a message to Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hesitantly steps closer to them. “What are you trying to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let him know that Maki’s goal is to make it to Kiibo’s lab,” Tsumugi continues. “So he should set up a guard point around there. And if killing Maki isn’t possible, then he’s just going to have to blow up the lab.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shouts, “You can’t do that! Tenko’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>And</i> one of our participants is in there, so only do it as a last resort,” Tsumugi adds, rolling her eyes at Kaede’s outburst. “Do you have all that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, yeah,” the Mother Monokuma says. “Let’s just see if I can do anything at all with this good for nothing surrogate separating a poor old mother from their children.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pinches the bridge of her nose at its whining but only responds with, “Just get the message out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede thinks for a split second of how to proceed before shouting, “Kiibo! Can you hear me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There are no monitors within the secret room, but the one from the library turns on at her call. Kiibo’s voice echoes back, “I can!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You heard what happened, right?” Kaede says. “Let the others know Monokuma knows about the plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Understood!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi crosses her arms. “Well, I suppose we’ve both done what we could with that. Still, though, I’m telling you Maki is not surviving her little scuffle with Monokuma.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what happens if she does and we do get the signal out?” Kaede asks. “Your game is ruined then, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I would highly prefer this plan fails, yes,” Tsumugi says. “But if it does succeed, you have to know there’s plainly no way you all just walk free.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So you kill us all instead?” Kaede narrows her eyes.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “We follow the rules to end the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But the whole point is that your rules don’t work and you’ve broken them over and over again,” Kaede says. “You can’t just say that doesn’t matter and pretend nothing happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, it does matter,” Tsumugi says. “I’m expecting a lot of backlash from all this, but I’d rather have just one subpar killing game than ruin the whole thing. Oh, and,” she puts a hand up, “don’t bother asking me what that means—I’ll explain later at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her hands into fists. “There’s not going to be a trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you want me dead there is,” Tsumugi says. “And after you finish investigating this room, you’re really going to want me dead. Trust me—I wouldn’t lie to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fidgets slightly, not entirely sure how to respond to Tsumugi’s directions. “I already investigated here earlier with Miu. There’s nothing here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, there is,” Tsumugi says. “I just didn’t have it ready back then. Go ahead—look around. I’ll wait. Oh, but if you do try to ask me anything, pretend I’m old, plain, boring me, just as a little favor. It’ll be easier to cut together that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re disgusting,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi flinches at her words, immediately reverting back to her disguise. “Ah, Kaede, I know I’m plain but isn’t that a little harsh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sneers at her but moves to discover whatever clues Tsumugi has left lying around. The first one is laid out in plain view on the previously empty coffee table. Kaede looms over what looks like a bloody monopad before hesitantly clicking it on.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The information confuses her for half a second before she remembers what Tenko had said earlier at the trial. “This belonged to Rantaro, didn’t it? It was his survival perk. Did you,” she turns to Tsumugi who’s staring at her innocently. Kaede rolls her eyes. “Did the mastermind take it from his room before the dorms were destroyed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know about that,” Tsumugi says. “I mean—it’s covered in blood. And the first time there was that much blood at the school was… Rantaro’s death, wasn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks back down at it, noticing the outline of a handprint, and she whips back to hiss at Tsumugi, “you took it off his corpse?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shrugs. “Who knows? How would someone even do something like that? No one was in the photos you and Shuichi set up in the library, and when Shuichi investigated the body, Rantaro only had his regular monopad on him, didn’t he?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls at her. “Why are you bothering with hiding things anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because there’s going to be another trial,” Tsumugi says. “So, I think we should think about the mystery behind Rantaro’s missing second monopad and how it ended up here later. There’s one more thing to investigate here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that is?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I don’t know,” Tsumugi says. “Why don’t you try looking around for…” she trails off as Kaede stares her down. With a huff she says, “Maybe someone came in here later looking to <i>throw away</i> some evidence.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not going through the garbage can.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shoots her a dirty look before hurrying over to reach into the trashcan herself. “There’s nothing even in here besides,” and she pulls out a shot put ball, “this. Now why don’t you,” she walks over to Kaede, extending the shot put with both hands. “Investigate.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches her carefully as she takes it before giving in and turning the shot put over in her hands. Holding a shot put ball again makes her feel slightly sick, but she inspects it, not noticing anything out of the ordinary until a fleck of color catches her attention. She picks at it with two fingers and the small pink fuzz comes away in her fingers. “Is this… a thread from my vest? When did you take this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I never took anything from one of your vests,” Tsumugi says. “What a strange question, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only person who could have put this here is you,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “But the only person who could have done it is in this room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “When would I have…” the answer dawns on her and her voice lowers as she asks, “how the hell did you get this? Doesn’t Mononkuma clean up the crime scenes?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Was that at a crime scene?” Tsumugi asks. “I mean, I think if it was, wouldn’t it plainly be, you know, covered in blood? But if someone had washed it, then that thread would have been washed away, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s grip tightens. “This is my shot put. This is the one I carried around in my backpack and rolled down the vent.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Could be,” Tsumugi says. “But you should really save that thought for later. For the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The trial, I know,” Kaede says. “And you keep saying that, but there isn’t going to be a trial. Do you really think anyone is actually going to try to kill someone now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, there could be if you let slip who I am,” Tsumugi says. “But then someone will be executed and we’ll be down to three. Assuming Monokuma can get his act together and kill Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m working on it!” The Mother Monokuma huffs. “There’s a process to these things, you know!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps her glare locked firmly on Tsumugi. “So you agree then—there’s no reason for there to be another trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “Not a new trial, no. But the sixth trial is meant to be special, and there’s definitely precedent for retrials, so I figured why not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Many things about her cavalier statement strike Kaede, and her questions come out rapid fire. “Precedent? You mean the two killing games from forever ago? And how the hell can there be a retrial for anything? Isn’t that admitting that we got the culprit wrong?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “I’m not going to answer any of your questions now, but I want you to hold on to that shot put ball and just think it over, okay? There was… one thing I was considering doing to add in a red herring, but it just seems silly now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What’s even the point in trying to trick me now?” Kaede asks. “I already know your plan.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s smile is sympathetic. “You definitely know more than you should, I’ll give you that. And this was going to be a last minute trick about the mastermind, so it wouldn’t do anything for you.” She laughs. “And it’s pretty ridiculous, too—more of an in joke than anything to take seriously.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t share her humor. “What about you trying to trick us is so funny?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi waves her hand. “Oh, I think trying to convince you that you have a twin sister who somehow snuck into the game or faked her death or something and is the mastermind is pretty funny. You didn’t see the Hope’s Peak Flashback Light, though, so you probably just think it’s weird.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do think that’s weird,” Kaede says. “And is something that stupid really supposed to be convincing to anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Eh, kinda,” Tsumugi says. “If you meet up with Ryoma, ask him about Enoshima Junko’s twin sister. Maybe he can explain why it’s so funny—though I guess if it needs an explanation, it’s really not that great of a joke, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t even bother to voice her disapproval, and Tsumugi laughs at her glare. “Well,” Tsumugi continues, “I need to be heading back now anyway if I don’t want to seem completely suspicious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She moves to leave, and Kaede blocks her path. “No—you’re going to answer me right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi quirks an eyebrow. “Okay. And you’re going to bash me over the head if I don’t?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede suddenly becomes very aware of the intensity of her grip on the shot put. “I… could.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You really shouldn’t,” Tsumugi says, pouting. “If you did then you coming this far would be kind of meaningless. Escaping death for the entire game just to be executed right at the very end?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I,” Kaede says. “I’m not afraid to die. And I’m not afraid of your executions either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi rolls her eyes. “It’s not about you—it’s about me. I can’t have you die right before the end.” She starts to leave the room again, and this time Kaede doesn’t stop her. “And the only person getting executed at the end is me, alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches her back until she disappears around the corner and back out into the library. The Mother Monokuma chuckles in the distance. “Well, this has certainly been an adventure. But I guess that was to be suspected with a mastermind who can barely hold things together. To be honest, I’m just happy the game got this far at all.” It lets out a sigh. “They just don’t make despair like they used to. Where’s Enoshima Junko when you need her?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Something about its tone catches Kaede’s attention as odd. “Hey,” she says, addressing the giant robotic bear head. “By the way, who actually is this Enoshima Junko person? The others said she orchestrated the two previous killing games, but… does she actually have anything to do with us? If Tsumugi’s the mastermind then is she a Remnant of Despair or one of Enoshima Junko’s followers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It laughs in response. “You know, I think that’s just fun enough a question that I’ll answer—mostly because it has a really fun answer. Little miss mastermind is not a Remnant of Despair, but she definitely is a follower of Enoshima-san.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow. “Do you… know Enoshima Junko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I do,” the Mother Monokuma says. “Everyone in the world knows her. Everyone in the outside world, everyone in this world—Enoshima Junko practically is this world after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I meant do you know her personally?” Kaede asks, suspicions rising at the strange declaration.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You could say that,” it says. “Where there’s Monokuma there’s Enoshima Junko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But she’s been dead for years,” Kaede says. “And you just said she’s not running this killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It laughs again. “And that’s true, too! I haven’t said a single lie in this conversation, but you’re even more baffled than before, right? I told you your question had a fun answer!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears another distant explosion punctuating her bringing a hand to her forehead. “Alright, this is going nowhere—I’m leaving.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It keeps chuckling to itself as Kaede takes a moment to deposit the shot put ball in her bag. The motion makes her stomach turn, but she swallows her discomfort as she picks her way through the room, hesitating for a second in indecision before heading out through the secret passage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps a rough count of how long the journey takes her, noting the time amounts to very little when she reaches the girls’ bathroom. She exits the room, and the school seems to shake again. Down the hall, she hears a startled grunt and turns to see Ryoma slightly off kilter from the most recent explosion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma,” she says, heading over to him. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” he says dazed. “‘m fine. I’m… fine.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His response makes Kaede think he is decidedly not fine. “Are you sure? You seem…” she takes a second to really look him over and notices he seems far more disoriented than what the slight tremor running through the school would cause. “Kind of out of it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Would say that sounds about right,” Ryoma says. “Found this Flashback Light a while ago, and it keeps messing with my head.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A Flashback Light?” Kaede asks. “What did you remember?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing at first,” Ryoma says. “But ever since I used it, I keep getting these weird flashes of memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, like a delayed reaction?” she says. “I’m sorry it’s messing with you though—now’s really not a great time to randomly be blacking out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “It’s really not, but the memories aren’t unpleasant. There was one where some kid was talking about… how we’re all heroes or something. And another where… it was all of us—including everyone who died—together in some weird room, talking about how we were going to all be friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh…” Kaede says. “That does sound pretty nice. Kinda wish I saw it, too, actually.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A grim expression stretches over Ryoma’s face at her words. “Not sure about that. But…” he pauses for a moment, seeing to debate something before pulling out what Kaede recognizes as another Flashback Light. “There is a second Flashback Light that I… found.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You sound unsure about that,” Kaede says. “Do you think it’s a fake like the one that said I was the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just,” he says. “Just try it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma flicks it on without waiting for a response, and suddenly Kaede’s world goes white, then bright gold, then black. Then she’s filled with memories of other Ultimates all also going off on their own spaceships on separate missions. There are other survivors out there like them, but it was classified information that only the participants of the Gopher Project knew.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then the world fades back in. Ryoma’s still standing there, his mouth pressed into a thin line at the positive news. “We’re…” Kaede says. “We’re not the only survivors. Are the others the ones Monokuma is broadcasting the killing game to?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “Seriously doubt that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Kaede says. “Did you find more evidence?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” he says. “Have the evidence that I made this Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him and takes another look at the Flashback Light as if registering it for the first time. “You—how did you just…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The school’s pretty destroyed now,” Ryoma says. “And was wandering around when I found a room that had the door and part of the wall gone. Inside there was also this weird technology stuff.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait, which classroom was this?” Kaede asks. “I feel like we would have noticed stuff like that when we first explored the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just one of the regular classrooms,” Ryoma says. “No idea how it all got there or we missed it or whatever. But it looked like a workstation or something to create Flashback Lights, and, well,” he gestures to the one in his hand, “I made this one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “So they are just being made in the school by the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Seems like it,” Ryoma says. “And the happy one I was talking about—found it when I finished making this one. My guess is the mastermind prepped it, but then never got around to using it for some reason.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the mastermind wanted to give us weird, encouraging messages for some reason?” Kaede asks. “I mean, you did just happen to find it, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “No. When I made the Flashback Light I showed you, it appeared in a locker. That’s how I found the first one—it was already there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So the one you saw was created the same way the one you made was?” Kaede asks. “That must be the place they’re produced then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think so,” Ryoma says before casting his gaze down to the Flashback Light. “And starting to think that all the Flashback Lights are fake. If I could make one to say whatever I wanted, the mastermind definitely has been.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was afraid of something like that,” Kaede says. “So—I’m kinda even more afraid to ask this but—how far back do you think our fake memories go? If all of the Flashback Lights have been fake, then we don’t know anything about the outside world or why we’re here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a breath. “Saw the destroyed world for myself, but… if Monokuma’s able to bring in all these copies there has to be the manpower to manufacture Monokumas on the outside. And that’s not a good sign.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede agrees. “Because wouldn’t that mean… the outside world is on Monokuma’s side? If no one’s rescued us, they’re actively supplying Monokuma, and just watching us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just what the hell is the world like?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s voice drops a few decibels, barely rising over the sounds of fighting from outside when she responds, “I don’t know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And who the hell are we?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know that either,” Kaede says. “I still have my memories from home, but there’s nothing I remember like Monokuma or the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a moment before asking the question Kaede didn’t know she had been dreading. “Think those are fake, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The first Flashback Light was the group funeral, right? Or was it us running from the Ultimate Hunt? I don’t remember, but,” Kaede says. “Those were the earliest Flashback Lights—so our memories from before those have to be right. Those are real.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t seem as convinced as Kaede hoped her false confidence would make him. His next words do nothing to quell her unease as he asks, “Kaede—one more thing. Was… there ever a moment when you tried to remember how you got here and just…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He trails off, and Kaede feels a lump form in her throat as she knows exactly what he’s talking about. “Did your head start hurting really badly, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods somberly. “Don’t know what the hell we got mixed up in, but I think it’s a lot worse than we thought.” He lets out a humorless laugh. “Never thought that a game where we’re forced to kill each other could somehow be even worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “But… there’s going to be no more murders. Not after today. So,” she summons her best smile, “I want you to remember that promise I made on the first day here. When we do get out of here, we’re all going to be friends, alright, Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And despite the darkness of the conversation, Ryoma smiles back. “Personally, I’d say we’re already friends, Kaede. Or at least friendly acquaintances.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m glad to hear that,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In the ruins of the school, their shared moment is interrupted by a click Kaede has come to recognize means Kiibo has taken over one of the monitors. “Kaede, Ryoma,” he says. “Tenko has almost finished her preparations, however, she could use more assistance for the final step.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi not enough help?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip as Kiibo flatly replies. “No.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives the monitor a dubious stare as Kiibo abruptly turns himself off. Kaede quickly finds her own explanation. “He’s probably just busy helping Maki and Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Ryoma says, suspicion lingering in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walk back through the school requires a few stops for them to push the newly created rubble to clear a path. The entire outside of the school appears in ruins, though the commotion appears to be gone. Kaede still hears the distant noise of gunshots and guesses the fight has moved to the lower courtyard, closer to Kiibo’s lab. She bites her lip, wondering if she should have done something to stop Tsumugi from speaking to the Mother Monokuma when she had the chance.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Beside her, Ryoma says, “Think we’re clear until we reach the stairs. After that,” he shrugs. “It’ll probably be a lot worse.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods in agreement, and they begin their trek over the scorched ground of their former prison. She notes the destroyed remains of the gardens and sheds that she had once frequented lying in heaps next to a variety of destroyed Monokuma vehicles. She briefly searches for the remains of a purple Exisal and feels a rush of relief at finding no signs of it.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the top of the stairs leading down, Kaede sees the full picture of the scene below. Monokuma’s original tank has taken a beating but appears to still be functional enough to continue engaging in its firefight with Kaito. The Exisal darts around Tenko’s lab, and Kaede gets a clear view of another one of Monokuma’s missiles ripping through the once beautiful dojo.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She watches the building fall for a brief moment before Ryoma mumbles to himself, “Where’s Maki?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His words alert Kaede that Maki is nowhere to be seen. “Maybe she’s already inside of Kiibo’s lab? He said Tenko needed extra help, so maybe Maki—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says, pointing out towards Kiibo’s lab, or more specifically, the roof of it. “There.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede had never thought someone could stand atop Kiibo’s lab from the spherical shape of the roof, but there Maki was kneeling next to a makeshift looking antenna behind her. The rather comically macabre image of Kiibo’s head on a spike is somehow overshadowed by the sheer rush of nerves Kaede suddenly feels.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “Looks like Tsumugi and Tenko got out of the building though…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spares a glance away from Maki to see the two girls standing at the base of the lab, Tenko furiously checking her monopad for something. Kiibo decides to speak up from Kaede’s monopad as well at that moment, and after quickly retrieving him from her backpack, he says, “Kaede, Ryoma, you are currently standing in the open and might want to find cover.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is there going to be more fighting?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have conferred with Maki and we are both unsure what Monokuma’s response is going to be once the message begins,” he explains. “In the event that it is violent, he will likely be targeting Maki, and it is necessary she exposes herself while the signal is being broadcast. Kaito will attempt to preoccupy Monokuma, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s dangerous for us to just stand here,” Ryoma says. “And you’re arguing with Tenko down there about it, too, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo sighs. “She is rather persistent, though I do not know how she is intending to do anything against Monokuma’s weaponry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, Kiibo,” Kaede says. “Just… don’t worry about us—we’re not gonna die. Focus on Maki.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma doesn’t know the hidden meaning of her words, but he nods in agreement anyway. “Yeah, your first priority is the person being shot at.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kiibo says. “And also Maki is informing me she is ready. We are going to reverse the signal and instead of receiving messages, send one ourselves. And… I have also taken the liberty to make a bit of a show of it. Just to make sure the message gets across.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s about to ask what he means when the walls of dome, previously projecting the day time sky are suddenly plastered with Maki’s face.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede watches in awe—distantly hearing Monokuma shriek as Kaito’s Exisal all but tackles his tank. Maki fidgets slightly, also probably taking in the sight of herself across the sky. “Well,” she says. “I suppose that says everything I need to. But I am alive—Kokichi was innocent, and Monokuma, the mastermind, and everyone else running this game broke their rules to execute him. You’ve already seen his fate, and seeing me here is more than enough evidence to prove that this game is invalid.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma’s tank gets a shot off, and a missile flies wildly, far over Maki’s head and careening into the dome. The resulting impact obviously shakes her, but Maki doesn’t move from her spot as she continues. “Monokuma is currently trying to kill me to cover up his mistake—this game is flawed and the mastermind has regularly been trying to cover up the truth since the very beginning. Even if you are enjoying this, everything you’re watching is a lie—if my death was a mistake, what other mysteries has Monokuma faked? How long has he been hiding the truth?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma screams, “The truth doesn’t matter!” in between blows of Kaito’s Exisal.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know now that you cannot destroy a game by working within its rules,” Maki says. “So there will be no more murders, no more victims, no more executions. Even if we all die, we refuse to play this game, and if you care about our lives in whatever twisted way, you care that we die fair. And that has not been happening.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then there will be a retrial!” Monokuma shouts. “That’s it—a bear can fix his mistakes!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki pays him no heed. “Maybe we are just race horses for you to bet on for who lives and who dies—but know that even that has been ruined for you. You cannot trust the killing game now, or as it was, or whatever happens in the future for it. This killing game and every killing game to come is now over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I’ll fix my mistake right—now!” Monokuma finishes, and another volley of missiles soar through the sky. The Exisal slams into the tank as it fires, sending the shots slightly off kilter but, Kaede realizes with absolute horror, not quite enough.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The shots tear through Kiibo’s lab and Miu’s below. Maki’s face flickers from the impassive expression she had been wearing for the entire broadcast to let out a brief gasp as the roof she had been standing on falls out from under her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The walls of the dome buzz with a newly displayed static. Everything feels like it’s moving in slow motion from how Kaede’s legs seem to refuse to move fast enough to the collapsing building to another shot that causes the base of Miu’s lab to crumple in on itself even more so.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki!” Kaito shouts, and the Exisal abandons its fight with Monokuma to race over to the remains of the two labs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hears Tenko scream, too, and sees her speed towards the rubble. Tsumugi follows nervously behind her, also calling out in worry. Monokuma stops his assault to laugh, chanting provocations that everyone ignores.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko and Tsumugi had been the closest and make it to Maki’s side first. Tenko shoves aside some of the wreckage with a bit of difficulty, Tsumugi hovering at her side. Then Kaito, hoping out of the Exisal in a panic, rushes over to try and assist her. It’s only when Kaede is at the edge of the remains of the building does she what they’re shoving at.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki sits up, cradling one of her arms so Kaede can’t see the full extent of the damage. But what Kaede can see is a rather nasty head wound trickling blood down her forehead and a huge slab of concrete completely burying one of her legs from the knee down. From the few grimaces she lets slip as Tenko and Kaito push fruitlessly to try and free her, Kaede gets the feeling that Maki isn’t in any condition to walk under her own power, let alone make the expert dodges she had before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And as Ryoma joins Kaede at her side, Maki voices her thoughts aloud. “Stop it,” she says. “You’re just wasting your own energy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaito says. “We’re not just leaving you to die here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It doesn’t matter if I live or die,” Maki says. “What matters is that you escape. If you stay here and let yourselves get killed, then everything I’ve done will have been for nothing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” Kaito says, near breathless, and it’s then Kaede fully takes in the dried blood on his shirt and smeared around his mouth. “I already thought you died once. I’m not going through that again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki gives him a hard look, her mouth pressing into a tight line.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stops her struggling then and moves to stand in front of Maki’s position, arms held stretched out on either side. She says, “Monokuma, Maki’s broadcast succeeded and whoever is watching us knows she is alive. There is no point or reason to kill her now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No reason?” Monokuma calls out. “Why, she committed grievous acts of violence against the headmaster, and that, children, is against the rules!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She didn’t kill you though,” Kaede says. “You fought, but she never destroyed you. Kiibo told us that there is only one Monokuma now, so if you’re here then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I attacked you, too!” Kaito shouts. “So if you wanna kill Maki, you’re gonna have to kill me, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki hisses in pain as she shifts to grab at Kaito’s pant leg. “Stop it. I’m telling you to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also,” Ryoma says. “Do you really want to be caught breaking your rules again right after that announcement?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pauses to grumble before says, “well, I also now feel the need to inform all of you that attendance at all class trials is mandatory! No ifs ands or buts!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But no one else is dead!” Tenko says. “You can’t just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The all too familiar chime announcing the end of an investigation echoes around them. Monokuma says, “as the game master, I reserve to hold a retrial for a trial gone wrong.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t redo Maki’s trial without her,” Kaito says. “I know what you’re trying to do and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“In a few short moments,” Monokuma says. “We will be holding a retrial for the murder of Rantaro Amami. All students are asked to report to the trial grounds in order to commence. And if your leg just happens to be stuck with no way of escape under a giant rock, well then that sucks for you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He vanishes at the end of his speech, leaving the others to stare at each other. Tsumugi says softly, “what are we supposed to do now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito starts to stomp back towards his Exisal. “We’re getting that boulder off of her and taking her with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This thing took a beating,” he says. “But it’s still pretty strong—I think I can lift it off of her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And then she’ll just have to lean on me or maybe Tenko through the trial. We just figure it all out fast and then find help for—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito, I can’t feel my leg anymore,” Maki says. “Even if you were able to use the Exisal, it wouldn’t matter. I…” She takes a deep breath. “I am going to die whether Monokuma decides to kill me or not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede tears her eyes away from Kaito to really take in Maki’s appearance. She seems paler by the second, and though her voice remains steady, Kaede can see her shaking. “Maki… you’re…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I knew I was likely to die as soon as I agreed to this plan,” Maki says. “And I knew I would be used up and then killed at some point as soon as I became an assassin. I never expected to make it through this game, so don’t feel sorry for me. Just get through the trial and survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko kneels at her side. “Tenko treated the others before maybe she can…” she pauses for a second to wipe at the tears brimming in her eyes. “Tenko can do something, and then you’ll make it through with the rest of us. We’re not sacrificing anyone anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma takes a step closer. “No,” he lets out a deep breath. “Maki is right. Trying to do anything would just prolong her pain. Know you’re all trying to be nice, but anything you do now isn’t a mercy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-Is she going to bleed out?” Tsumugi asks. “Or is she in shock? Is there anything we can do if she’s in shock? H-How do we know if someone’s in shock?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As Tsumugi panics, Tenko very gently reaches forward to take the arm Maki had been holding close to her chest. Maki winces as Tenko’s fingers graze her mangled limb, and Kaede squeezes her eyes shut, not bearing to look at the sight. “I… I don’t want to abandon her either, but I think Ryoma is right. We… what are we supposed to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well we’re not just fucking leaving her!” Kaito shouts. “We’re not—we’re not making it this far, losing her once, and then just deciding she’s dead!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Maki says. “Calm down and think about this rationally.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” he says. “You—you were the one who told me that throwing my life away was stupid, but you want me to just sit here and let you die alone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki lets out a deep breath. “You know I barely even had a life. This doesn’t mean the same thing it meant for the others who died. And you know I don’t care if I die alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well I do!” Kaito says. “You’re my friend, and I promised that I was gonna stay with you until the fucking end of this thing!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And I promised Kokichi that you would live,” Maki says, an air of finality in her words. “It was part of our deal. So you’re going to go to the trial and stop wasting time here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito falters for a second, clenching his jaw and his hands balling up into fists. Then he marches back over to Maki, kneeling at her other side and taking her uninjured hand. “Then I’m sorry I’m disappointing Kokichi. I already said it and I’ll say it again—I lost you once and I am not going through that again as long I live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaito,” Kaede says. “Are you really…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” he says, grinning fondly as he shakes his head. “You’re an idiot if you think you’re the only person here who knows they’re not making it out of this game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki struggles slightly at his words, grimacing as she jostles her own injured limbs. “Kaito, I won’t let you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As soon as I got this cough, all I could think is that if I was gonna die, I wanted it to mean something,” Kaito says. “You said your death doesn’t matter because you’re not a person, but, hey,” he smiles down at her, “I think spending my last breath telling you that’s not true—that would mean something, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki’s voice is choked when she speaks next, and Kaede finds herself taken aback at a sight she thought was impossible. Maki shakes her head, the tears streaming freely down her face. “No! I already told you—I don’t want you to die! I don’t care if I’m alone—I don’t care who leaves me as long as…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her voice becomes more and more garbled and Kaede hears her whisper, “I don’t want you to die,” again before Kaito gingerly wraps his arms around her shaking shoulders.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s crying, too. “Maki, Kaito… you’re both…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaito says. “Yeah, we are.” Maki hammers his chest with her good hand, and he wheezes at the contact. “Hey now, let me get a few more goodbyes in, Harumaki. We’re gonna go out like heroes, you know? And heroes always say goodbye.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees Maki shake her head again as the nickname seems to make her cry harder. “Did you make that up just now?” she asks, trying to keep her tone light even as her voice falters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Sure did,” he says with a grin. “Oh, and by the way, Kaede—you’re still angry, right? You’re still gonna fight Monokuma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, swallowing the lump in her throat. “I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good,” Kaito says. “Then give ‘em hell for me. And you, too, Tenko. And Ryoma—let them know what you’re fighting for. And, hell, Tsumugi, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I’ll try,” Tsumugi stammers, and the false sympathy in her voice makes Kaede’s stomach turn.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki slams her hand into Kaito again, finding her voice as she says, “You—letting yourself die—you know that only makes my pain worse? Knowing that you’re dying because of me—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maki,” he says. “You know I don’t have a lot of time left—I’m kinda fighting to even hold it together right now. So, the way I see it, I could spend my last few moments yelling at Monokuma,” he squeezes her hand. “Or I could spend them with you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Maki just shakes her head, but doesn’t say anything more after that, seemingly torn between being pained and relieved by the turn of events.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma says, “so you’re decided then—no changing your mind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nah,” Kaito says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright,” he says before taking a deep breath. “Then…” he pauses, and Kaede realizes she has no idea what anyone is supposed to say when faced with such a horrible situation before them. “Take care.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Will do,” Kaito grins back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s still wiping at her eyes as she slowly lifts herself back to a standing position. Kaede moves over to support her, gently placing a hand on her back. To Kaito and Maki, Kaede says, “what we did mattered, and we’re going to make the mastermind and Monokuma—and everyone—knows that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You bett—” Kaito cuts himself off as a cough racks his body. Maki shifts as much as she can to attend to him, even though there’s nothing either of them can do at this point.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It becomes clear his coughing fit is going to take a while. Maki pauses, then all the emotion that had burst out of her suddenly drains away in favor of her usual guarded expression. She nods to them. “Go—Monokuma won’t wait forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods back and forces herself to look away from them and make those first few steps out of the rubble. Tenko’s walking with her, and she hears Ryoma and Tsumugi’s footsteps behind, crunching the remains of the labs underneath them.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaito’s coughing, however, is the noise that follows her as they finally reach the landing before the elevator.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">When there, Tenko tugs at her sleeve. “Kaede,” she says, voice still hoarse from crying. “Are you going to be okay?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” she says. The gravity of losing one of her first friends and her first rival at the academy still hasn’t hit her yet, and her voice is hollow when she replies. “I don’t know. They were…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets at her answer. “Tenko doesn’t know either, but… about the trial—Monokuma said it was going to be a retrial for Rantaro’s murder. Are you,” Kaede sees the fright in her eyes as Tenko drops her voice to a whisper, “are you going to be executed, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her chest seize up at the thought. “I,” she glances over her shoulder to Tsumugi standing placidly behind them. “No—I-I don’t think that’s going to happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re sure?” Tenko says, still obviously terrified.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” Kaede says. “Because… I don’t think I killed Rantaro.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A story I meant to tell at the end of last chapter but forgot is kind of what inspired Maki's death fake out. When V3 was first released in Japan, there were a ton of fake spoilers floating around, and my personal favorite is that Rantaro faked his death and hid in the vents since it gets sillier the more you try to think through the details. So for this chapter, I tried to think out a way where something like that could plausibly happen, and hopefully I did an alright enough of a job!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter Notes</span></p>
<p class="p9"><span class="s1">See the end of the chapter for </span><span class="s2">notes</span><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The elevator doors slide shut behind the four of them. Processing what is happening right now in the school grounds is beyond Kaede. She doesn’t want to think about what kind of punishment Monokuma has for breaking the rules—if it’s more or less brutal than an execution. But whatever it is, it doesn’t seem real in the moment. It feels wrong not to stare at Kaito’s back as the elevator descends, but that doesn’t equate to him being dead in Kaede’s mind. She knows that will come later.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The trial room feels so empty. Last time, the sheer presence of the Exisal had accounted for their decreased numbers. Now Kaede takes her podium, pointedly aware of the crosshair painted over Maki’s face and the X splattered over Kaito’s.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She glances across the room. Tsumugi looks at peace with the proceedings she and Kaede both know are leading to her demise. The calmness in the face of death, here, isn’t reassuring like Kokichi’s, Angie’s or Korekiyo’s parting before their executions. Instead it sends a chill through Kaede that she only shakes off when Monokuma starts to talk.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well now, well now, well now,” he says. “Seems only four of my five naughty students made it down to the trial. How unfortunate…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There were six of us,” Ryoma says coldly. “Stop trying to deny it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, but you see, this is the world of Monokuma, which means it’s my world!” Monokuma says. “And in my world, I decide what happens—get it? I hand out the rewards and the punishments, the trials and tribulations, the rules and regulations—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t though,” Kaede says. “Someone else decided the rules of the game. Trying to follow them has been actively hurting you this whole time. There has to be some reason for handcuffing yourself like this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma brings his paws to his mouth. “Oh, someone’s excited. You just wanna get right to the good stuff, huh? Skip the foreplay and get right to the climax, huh? But,” his giggling fades as he brandishes his claws. “I’ve had enough of your sequence breaking for one game. Anymore and the whole thing falls apart, so you’re just gonna have to be patient and take things one step at a time. Speed running is strictly forbidden!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we can’t just vote for who we think the mastermind is,” Tenko says. “We have to… do another trial even after Kokichi and Maki, and Kaito, too, all died to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As a bonus for making it this far, however!” Monokuma says. “I will give you all a little hint just to spice things up as we dive into the truly mysterious trial of who killed Rantaro Amami, the Ultimate Something-Something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ultimate Survivor,” Ryoma says. “That’s not a mystery.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma bulldozes over his comment. “There are four of you remaining! One of you… is a dirty, no good, traitorous mastermind who has been working against you the whole time!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We… know that, too,” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“<i>And</i>,” Monokuma says. “I just think it’s a rather interesting little fact that we have one mastermind and three participants, here, but this game is only designed to have two survivors… I wonder what that despair-ful detail could mean.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses briefly before she shakes her head. “When we find the mastermind, the game is over. You can’t turn us against each other anymore, and we know your rules don’t mean anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma gasps, offended. “My rules mean a great deal! They mean so much that I will not allow any more conversation that’s not about the untimely death of Rantaro Amami. They mean so much that there’s currently a truly brutal murder taking place right now!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede flinches. “You can’t just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So on that fateful day, just what did happen? I have to admit, I am one curious bear!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw, staring him down as if enough eye contact will reveal his true motives.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says. “Tenko knows that Shuichi wasn’t Rantaro’s real killer, but…” she shoots a nervous look to Kaede. “Tenko also thinks maybe we should just… leave it at that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma follows her gaze. “Have to agree,” he says. “Kaede’s right—we’re not about to betray each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tsumugi says. “You’re just trying to trick us into sacrificing Kaede, and we’re not going to fall for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi coming to her defense as earnestly as Ryoma and Tenko unsettles Kaede, and it’s all she can do to keep her attention on Monokuma. “Oh?” he says. “I’m trying to trick you? Is that what you all think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, we do, but,” Kaede says. “This ‘trick’ isn’t about me, is it? Shuichi was innocent—there’s no doubt about that—but… you’re trying to get us to ask the wrong questions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi says. “Really? I mean, I believe you, but what are the ‘right’ questions then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not whoever killed Rantaro,” Tenko says quickly. “We don’t need to talk about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Kaede says. “It’s okay—Monokuma’s not about to do anything to hurt me now. It wouldn’t fit with whatever he’s trying to accomplish.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her an odd look. “Alright then. Does that mean it’s fine to figure out what happened to Rantaro, or is that what Monokuma wants us to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede knows the answer is both, but she replies, “I’m not sure, but I do think it’s necessary that we confirm who killed Rantaro just… to clear up any remaining doubts.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, yes,” Monokuma says. “Clearing the sullied name of your beloved—truly a task any love struck heroine would be up for.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede scowls at him. “Can you just shut up?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tsumugi says. “I think Monokuma’s being pretty rude, too, but if we just keep arguing with him, we’re not really going to get anywhere are we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The real question, which Kaede hears Tenko softly mutter to herself, “what are we trying to get to?” isn’t the most pressing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the first trial,” Tsumugi begins. “We thought Shuichi was the culprit, but that wasn’t right, was it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede proved she did it,” Ryoma says. “There was a trap in the library or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The culprit doesn’t matter,” Tenko says. “No one should be punished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, I said it’s fine,” Kaede says. “Because even though what happened is my fault, I… have new evidence now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You found something else out about Rantaro’s murder?” Ryoma asks, clearly dubious of her claim. “How?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi comes to her defense, “I’d like to know that, too, but what even is the evidence you found? Does it tell us who really killed Rantaro?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If it does,” Tenko says. “Then Tenko would prefer not to talk about it. Tenko doesn’t think she can make herself vote for anyone to die again…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m,” Kaede says. “I’m sorry you feel that way, but I’m not sure if that’s a possibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a fleeting look of something conflicted in Tenko’s eyes, but she says nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What I found isn’t enough on its own to prove who Rantaro’s true killer is,” Kaede says. “But it’s enough to prove it isn’t me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Still don’t understand how you just stumbled upon something like that,” Ryoma says. “A lot of time has passed since Rantaro’s case, and Monokuma cleans up evidence after we’re done investigating a murder. Not to mention that the school was being destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Monokuma says. “Are you saying it almost sounds like the evidence had to be handed to Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at him. “You’re not part of this debate. And to answer your question,” she turns back to Ryoma, “I found it somewhere we weren’t able to explore before. The school being destroyed actually helped in this case.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Some place we weren’t able to explore before…” Tsumugi says. “The only place I can think of is the secret door in the library. Is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Being helped by Tsumugi makes Kaede’s stomach churn, but she still pushes ahead. “That’s right. Like Ryoma said, the school was falling apart, and the door got damaged badly enough that I was able to get inside.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And there was evidence about what happened to Rantaro in there?” Tenko asks. “In the mastermind’s secret room? Is that also where Himiko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says softly. “I think so…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko sees…” she says. “The mastermind probably killed Rantaro, too, then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think they did,” Kaede says. “Because in a trashcan in that room, I found a shot put ball just like the one I thought I killed Rantaro with.” She shakes her head. “No, not just like the one I used—it was the one I used. It even had a fiber from one of my vests still stuck to it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “So the weapon you used and the one we found at the scene of the crime were different? And someone able to get into the mastermind’s room took the shot put you had used?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hold on,” Ryoma says. “Something’s… weird about this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi says. “There is? I plainly haven’t noticed anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s what Kaede said,” he answers. “She said she got into the secret room where Himiko was killed, but, Kaede, you already knew about that room. During… Gonta’s trial, you said that you, Miu, and Kokichi were the only ones who knew. So this wasn’t the first time you went there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede fiddles with the bill of her hat, shifting it to cover a bit more of her face. “No, it wasn’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we could access the room before the school was destroyed?” Tenko asks. “Then wouldn’t Kaede have found the shot put before…” she trails off, and Kaede can tell it’s not out of confusion but a want to reach the conclusion.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s… kind of complicated,” Kaede says. “I found a secret passage in the girls’ bathroom with Miu a while ago that led to the secret room. I just didn’t know at the time that it was the same room that was in the library.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then are two ways to get to the mastermind’s secret room?” Tsumugi asks. “The one in the library and the one you and Miu found earlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you didn’t find the shot put the first time you went there?” Ryoma asks. “Didn’t you say it was just in a trashcan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… does seem strange,” Tenko concedes. “Did Kaede just not check the trashcan the first time?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede squeezes her eyes shut. “No, I did. And it was empty the first time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you checked it again when you went the second time,” Tenko says. “And there was evidence about Rantaro’s case in it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is plainly strange, isn’t it?” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, I wonder what that could mean,” Monokuma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs at Monokuma’s response. “That’s not a good sign. Kaede, I don’t think you’re the mastermind—the fake Flashback Light that tried to make us think you were a Remnant of Despair wouldn’t make any sense if you were. But you have to tell us why he keeps saying things like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s gaze briefly flickers to Monokuma, obviously enjoying himself, and the glee on his robotic face is more than enough for her to make up her mind. “You were right with you said earlier, Ryoma. Finding evidence for Rantaro’s case at this point when Monokuma was planning to hold a retrial for him is too weird to be a coincidence. When I went to the secret room the second time, I was directed basically handed new evidence that the mastermind put out for us to find for this trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen. “So discovering Rantaro’s killer is all part of the mastermind’s plan. Th-Then Tenko thinks we should stop this trial right now. We promised Maki and Kaito we weren’t going to play the mastermind’s game anymore, and Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wait,” Tsumugi interrupts. “I don’t get it—are you saying the mastermind wants us to reveal them? But doesn’t that stop the game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know anymore,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma scowls. “There’s something wrong with this trial. We’re stuck in some trap, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Monokuma wants to trick us into executing someone,” Tenko says. “Kaede has proof that she’s innocent, so Monokuma is trying to force her into killing one of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says softly, “Monokuma isn’t forcing me to do anything…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi either doesn’t hear her or pretends not to. “Oh, I think I understand what’s happening. Monokuma is using Rantaro and Shuichi’s deaths to blackmail Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That,” Ryoma says. “Could be true. Kaede, you’ve had the weight of their deaths over you this whole time, haven’t you? Wouldn’t blame you if you wanted to set things right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip. “I don’t know about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede and Shuichi were close,” Tenko says. “Tenko wants to find Himiko’s true killer… so she understands. The only person here to blame is the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s true,” Tsumugi says. “If what Kaede said was true about there being two murder weapons, and one of them was found in a place only the mastermind could access, then the mastermind has to be the one who really killed Rantaro.” She hugs her arm. “And they covered up their crime and executed poor Shuichi for it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko understands, then,” Tenko says. “This is for Shuichi’s sake—and Rantaro’s, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses for a moment, then, she reaches up to take off her hat.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It feels a bit odd coming off, her hair clinging to it and rising up to give her what Kaede knows is particularly bad hat hair. Tenko stares at her wide eyed, but Tsumugi is the one to say, “Kaede? What are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shuichi didn’t kill Rantaro,” Kaede says. “You all already know that he lied at the trial because he wanted to save me. I was stupid and reckless… and I got him and Rantaro killed—no matter what Monokuma says about the true culprit of this case or whatever, what happened to them is still my fault.” Her grip on the hat tightens just a little, and Kaede knows her words are meant mostly for herself even as she feels compelled to say them aloud. “Kaito gave this to me to be nice, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Tenko said this before, but you can wear it for whatever reason you want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gives her a sympathetic smile. “I know, and I think I have. I think I’ve been doing it to punish myself. Shuichi—and Rantaro, too—aren’t… real to me. I don’t think any of us knew them long enough to actually know them as people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh,” Tsumugi says. “That’s kinda sad.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s true, though,” Ryoma says. “Sometimes people can come to mean something to you fast, but also when you’re just surrounded by death, it’s hard to know what you’re really missing.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think I could have said it better,” Kaede says. “They didn’t deserve to die, and it’s wrong that they died so I could live, but to the mastermind, to whoever is watching us, they’re not people to them either, are they? No one who died is. They’re all just punishments. That’s why we have these stupid trials and these horrible executions because someone wants to see us suffer and they’re—they’re,” Kaede’s fists clench and it takes all of her self control not to just throw the hat in her hand at Monokuma, “they’re getting off on making us miserable—on seeing us make friends so it’ll hurt more when they’re ripped away, and I refuse to be part of that anymore!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma sighs. “Blah, blah, blah, ‘you won’t betray each other anymore.’ You said that already. You’re boring m—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t control me anymore,” Kaede says. “You’re making us go over Rantaro’s case again to torture me for your stupid audience, and I’m not putting up with it anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” Tsumugi says. “Are you… not participating then? I mean, I get what you’re saying, but our lives are still on the line. This trial decides if we live or die, and I don’t know if I can bear to throw it all after everything we’ve been through.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at her. “I know, and I am going to tell you exactly what happened to Rantaro, but I’m not doing it for Shuichi, or ‘justice,’ or even to survive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Monokuma says. “But those all certainly seem like mankind’s most common motives! What else left is there? I can bear-ly wait to find out! Right after this commercial break!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not serious,” Ryoma deadpans.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma continues to ramble, but Kaede pays him little attention as she says her next words directly to Tsumugi. “The only reason I’ve let this go this far is so I can kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko must have overheard her over Monokuma’s non sequitur. Her voice is tinged with worry as she says, “Kaede? You really want to—” Tenko shakes her head, cutting herself off. “Tenko knows what they’ve done, but what Maki said about how killing the mastermind doesn’t end the game—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “And that’s fine. I can do both.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Ryoma says, adding his voice to the conversation. “One more of us really is going to die then.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “That’s kind of horrible to think about, but it’s not like they don’t deserve it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s expression remains conflicted, and she seems to be on the verge of saying but ultimately remains silent as Kaede moves the debate forward. “I don’t know why the mastermind would hold a retrial for a murder they’re responsible for, but there can be no doubt that Rantaro’s killer and the mastermind are one and the same.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The trial plainly is the best way forward, then, isn’t it?” Tsumugi asks. “I guess in that case, we should go over the incident with Rantaro one more time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Probably,” Ryoma says. “But this seems weird. Like, Kaede said, why would the mastermind set themselves up to get executed?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess we’ll have to ask them when we find out who they are,” Kaede says. “And I think the best way to do that is for everyone to give their alibis for Rantaro’s death. One of them isn’t going to hold up, and that’s how we’ll know who it is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was in the classroom connected to the library by the vent with Shuichi,” Kaede says. “I did roll the shot put through the vents to try and kill whoever opened the secret door, but…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe you missed?” Tsumugi says. “Or were stopped somehow?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which means I thought I was Rantaro’s killer,” Kaede says. “But I know now for a fact that I’m not, and I am not the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also not the mastermind,” Ryoma says. “But I was in my room the whole time. Not gonna pretend I have an alibi, but I didn’t do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was in the dining hall with Kirumi, Miu, and Korekiyo,” Tsumugi says. “I left to go to the bathroom once, but I think I was only gone for about five minutes. And there’s also just no way someone as plain as me could be the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says softly, “Tenko was with Kaito the whole time. We left the strategy meeting together to look for Rantaro when he didn’t come back.” She looks at the ground. “Tenko is also not the mastermind…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Hearing Tsumugi hold onto her normal persona even as she purposefully gives herself away makes Kaede clench her fists involuntarily. “Tsumugi, I said the secret passage I found leading to the room in the library was in the girls’ bathroom. Are really you not even trying anymore?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wha—?” Tsumugi gasps. “Me? You think I’m the mastermind? That’s—that’s crazy! That’s just—” she looks around the room wildly to see both Ryoma and Tenko have taken the news rather impassively. “Guys?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo told Tenko when she was setting up Maki’s broadcast,” Tenko confesses. “And… Tenko could also guess at this point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Same here,” Ryoma says. “Think Kaede is still hiding something from us, but this is what makes the most sense. Sorry, Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi looks at the verge of tears. “You guys can’t be serious. You really think I could kill some—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t apologize to her,” Kaede says. “She used the secret passage to kill Rantaro when my trap failed, she lured Gonta to his death, and she murdered Himiko in cold blood.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a breath. “Right. I… wasn’t leaving the fourth floor during the blackout. Tsumugi left me alone, which I guess she did so she could go kill Himiko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was physically stuck with Kokichi the whole time, and Tenko went to search outside where there are no secret passages to the mastermind’s room,” Kaede says. “That also proves Tsumugi is the only one who could have committed a crime done by the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s all a coincidence!” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi, please stop,” Tenko says. “We know you betrayed us, so just… tell us what happens next. Tenko doesn’t want to talk about this anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi gives her a pleading look for a second longer before her expression shifts to something slightly annoyed. “Well, that was anticlimactic. Fine, I’ll admit it, you got it right. But you still don’t have all the details about who I really am, so it’s fine. This game’s not won until you solve that mystery first.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns. “Are you saying you have a secret identity? We didn’t get any clues about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean I didn’t hand you any clues during the investigation like I did with the stuff about Rantaro’s murder,” Tsumugi says. “But you certainly have everything you need to figure it out anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says. “I’m not particularly inclined to believe Tsumugi right now, but when we split up at the school…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He trails off, and Kaede sighs in response. “Yeah, I knew earlier. Tsumugi was actually how I got into the secret room in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And,” he says. “Why did you lie?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I figured it out earlier, and Tsumugi just came and confessed to me,” Kaede says. “She said that if I didn’t expose her immediately, we’d get the evidence for this trial and we could kill her. I think she thought I agreed because I wanted to exonerate Shuichi, but really… I just wanted her to pay without hurting anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You want her to die that badly?” Tenko asks softly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says. “I know you don’t like that, but… it’s not right if she just gets away with what she did to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw, Tenko still feels bad for me?” Tsumugi says. “Ha, I was half expecting you to throw me across the room when you found out. I guess sometimes characters grow more than you think they will.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shoots her a glare before turning back to Kaede. “Tenko is… sorry for interrupting. She knows Kaede will do what she thinks is right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think I agree with that, too,” Ryoma says. “Speaking of, what did you mean ‘without hurting anyone else?’”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi told me that if she was killed before she revealed herself as the mastermind, she would count as another victim and her killer would be executed,” Kaede says. “This way, we can just get rid of her directly.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Did you think one of us would snap and kill her if you said anything?” Ryoma asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There was a chance,” Kaede says. “But mostly… if she’s going to die, it should be through execution. Just getting stabbed or poisoned or whatever isn’t enough for her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, wow,” Tsumugi says. “You’ve certainly gotten bloodthirsty. Or have you always been like this and are just showing your real colors now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ve wanted to kill you since the first day we got here,” Kaede says. “Because I knew you would torture us and put us through hell—and you of all people have no right to call me ‘bloodthirsty’ after forcing us to kill each other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs. “You know I didn’t force you to do anything. So shouldn’t you really be mad at—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” Kaede shouts. “Do you really expect any of us to buy that after what we’ve been through? You’re a monster, and you’re the one who did this to us—end of story.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not, though,” Tsumugi says. “Because you haven’t figured out who I really am yet, and you’re not even close to solving the mystery of who really did this all to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It… wasn’t you?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you’re about to try and say we did this to ourselves again,” Ryoma says, irritation clear in his voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “Nope. Not me, and not you, but someone else is absolutely the reason why you’re all here. Well, a few someones, but that’ll all fit together later. And,” she smiles at Kaede, “if you want that information, you will need me alive to tell it, so let’s hold off on the vote for now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pauses, looking Tsumugi over. She places the hat that had been in her hands to side, and Tsumugi’s eyes nervously dart to the movement for just a moment. “You know,” Kaede says. “You used information as leverage when we made our deal earlier, but I think I’m done with that now. I don’t care what the truth is anymore. Maybe we’ll never find out why we were here, but I don’t want to know at this point. I’m done being strung along by you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Kaede,” Tenko says. “Tenko understand how you feel, but… maybe all of us should decide together.” She tilts her head to direct Kaede’s attention to Ryoma, fiddling rather pointedly with his cigarette. “Ryoma,” Tenko says. “What do you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He glances between Kaede and Tenko and sighs. “Kaede makes a good point, but also there’re some questions I think we really need answers to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like what?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How much of our memories are real,” he says. “Or what the world is actually like, who did Maki broadcast her message to, what the hell happens to us when Tsumugi dies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns, choosing her words carefully as she says, “you know that solving mysteries is what Tsumugi and her audience want.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says with a shrug. “But we’re also in the dark about too much. Mean, I don’t really care about who Tsumugi secretly is, but… who the hell are we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean?” Tenko asks. “We’re… us, aren’t we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He shakes his head. “The Flashback Lights told us we were Hope’s Peak students, but we proved that was a lie, and… think we can assume at this point that all the Flashback Lights that have been telling us stuff about the outside world or how we got here are lies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma discovered that the Flashback Lights are manufactured in the school,” Kaede says, filling in the information for Tenko. “Apparently you can make them say whatever you want. They weren’t giving us back our old memories—they just made us remember whatever the mastermind wanted.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay…” Tenko says hesitantly. “But what about the outside world?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t know anymore,” Ryoma says. “I know what I saw with my own eyes, but the Flashback Light creation thing I found had all this stuff about implanting memories about the fate of the outside world, not to mention…” his gaze focuses on Tenko. “Tenko, you and Kiibo were able to contact something or someone on the outside, right? So… the world can’t be completely destroyed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “That is correct. Tenko was confused about that, too, but Kiibo said his programming was already setup to deliver information to some outside network. Also,” she bites her lip, “he said it was specifically information from what he could hear and what the cameras in his eyes were picking up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does that mean Kiibo was monitoring us?” Kaede says. “He told me he thinks he was created specifically for the killing game, and if he was reporting what was happening to us…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But Kiibo helped us,” Tenko says. “And he helped get Maki’s message out and disable Monokuma, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “I know. I don’t think he was purposefully betraying us or anything… but it’s weird that he had a direct link to Tsumugi’s audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Ryoma says. “Answer the question: was Kiibo your mole?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “That’s not how this works. I give hints not answers. But if you would like a hint,” she says, perking up. “I’m more than happy to remind you about Kiibo’s inner voice! Wasn’t that plainly suspicious?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“His inner voice,” Ryoma says. “Been a long time since I heard that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “And I don’t think Kiibo really knew what it was either. But… he really wanted to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And now you get to figure it out,” Tsumugi says. “See, this trial is really just a great way to wrap up all the little mysteries.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Tenko says softly. “Will figuring this out help us get out of here? If we solve these… mysteries, we can go home, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “Of course. There’s no need to stick around a crime scene once the case has been closed after all, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, don’t bother asking her question,” Kaede says. “We can’t trust anything she says.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, there’s no need to be so rude,” Tsumugi says. “I want you guys to finish and go home as soon as possible, too. And one of the first steps to doing that is to figure out the mystery behind Kiibo’s identity. And my identity, too, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glares at her for a moment before she says, “there’s no point in trying to figure out someone as horrible as you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So Kiibo it is, then?” Ryoma says coolly.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs softy as Kaede answers him affirmatively. “Yeah. This was something he wanted to figure out, too, so we’re doing this for him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are we?” Tenko says quietly to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have to admit,” Tsumugi says. “I was just going to give you the answer to this one, but it’s plainly more exciting to watch you figure it out.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi ignores her. “For another hint, I will assure you Kiibo’s inner voice isn’t God or his conscience or anything silly like that. Kiibo was a robot after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo said that his inner voice told him not to give up hope a few times,” Tenko says. “So… something giving him advice?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It also stopped working when his body was destroyed,” Ryoma says. “So it wasn’t some program part of his A.I. or anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo told Tenko that his body was setup to receive signals from the outside,” Tenko says. “And he was also sending information to somewhere outside, too. That’s what he had Tenko connect him to for Maki’s broadcast.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’ve very close,” Tsumugi says. “And when you put all of that information together, what do you get, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a moment to shoot Tsumugi a cold look before she answers. “The only people interested in getting information about the killing game are Tsumugi’s audience. And it’s not that much of a stretch to assume the people giving him advice were the same ones watching his camera feeds.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That makes sense,” Ryoma says. “But… where does that get us? We know it was Tsumugi’s audience, but we still don’t know who that audience is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why you need to figure out my identity, too,” Tsumugi says. “I know you don’t want to get to know me or anything, but if you want the truth about the killing game then you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t care about the truth,” Kaede says. “And I don’t think you do either. We know you’ve lied and manipulated us every trial—why would this be any different? Actually,” she throws her hands in the air, “why the hell was this a trial for Rantaro anyway? All that would do is out you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles. “I think you answered your own question, Kaede. I was willing to lie a little to keep the game moving, I’ll admit, but now that we’re at the end, I’ve turned over a new leaf.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you really think any of us believe that?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “But you can believe whatever you want. The truth is what you make it, after all. Kaede, what was it Monokuma said to you after Shuichi’s death?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede narrows her eyes. “What are you talking about?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If everyone thinks something is the truth,” Tsumugi says. “And the truth is a lie, who can really say which is which?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is why I refuse to believe to anything you say,” Kaede says. “You can say whatever stupid thing you think about what makes something true, but if none of us are listening, then it doesn’t matter. The only person who cares about your lies is you,” she sneers, “and you can keep your pathetic mind games to yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t seem disturbed in the slightest by Kaede’s response and simply presses a hand to her chin. “Ah, I see, I have been going about this wrong, haven’t I?” she says. “Truth and lies were really more Kokichi’s thing, weren’t they? Or maybe Shuichi’s—I’m sure a detective would be way more excited about showing me the cold, hard truth and all that. It’s a shame that I don’t really have anything a pianist would be interested in, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. Tenko asks, “does that mean you’re done asking questions?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, no, not at all,” Tsumugi says. “I had just given up on one strategy since Kiibo isn’t here, but now I’m thinking of revisiting it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know if you tell us all of your plans to manipulate us, they’re not going to work,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, they still will,” Tsumugi says. “Despair is despair, no matter how it comes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, what the hell does ‘despair’ actually mean to you?” Kaede asks. “You just want to make us <i>sad</i>? Is that your goal?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs. “No, despair is much more than just that. It’s hard to describe, but it’s a feeling of pure hopelessness for your past, present, and future. The ceiling falling in and the ground swallowing you up—feeling empty but also like you’re ready to burst.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Couldn’t have said it better my self!” Monokuma says. “Despair isn’t just a feeling. It’s a way of life!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what the other killing games were about,” Tenko says. “But… the participants overcame it both times. And if Rantaro was in a third killing game and then came here, he also overcame despair, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Ryoma says. “Sounds like a pretty weak way of life to me. Not to mention all of the followers of despair are dead if they even existed.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’ll admit that the Flashback Lights are fake, yes,” Tsumugi says. “But the participants of the past games are as real as you and me. Oh, and thank you Tenko for bringing up Rantaro’s game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets under her stare. “Is Rantaro’s game important?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, this is Rantaro’s retrial,” Tsumugi says. “So it plainly makes sense to talk about him, don’t you think? I’d like to start the discussion with a question, too. Who do you all think was the mastermind of Rantaro’s previous killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede pinches the bridge of her nose. “Someone you’re working with obviously.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm,” Tsumugi says. “That’s pretty vague.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede is right, though,” Ryoma says. “You have to be working with an organization of some kind. Kaede told me a while ago that someone has to be cleaning up the school when you and Monokuma are both at the trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. “And all of this technology—the executions, a broadcast system, the ability to build and pilot multiple robots. There’s no way you’re the only person behind this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoever put Rantaro in this game probably had a connection to his last game, too,” Tenko says. “Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to record a video for himself… But why was he in a different killing game in the first place?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma nods. “Was thinking about that earlier, and came up with another question, too. Rantaro’s talent was Ultimate Survivor. Killing games are designed for Ultimates, so he had to have had a different talent before that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it got erased somehow or replaced by his survivor talent,” Kaede says. “We do already know that the mastermind can just play with our memories, so that’s not that hard to believe, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if Rantaro was in a different killing game,” Tenko says, voice suddenly growing urgent. “Then that means there were other Ultimates with him, right? What happened to them? Were they all killed? And how do Ultimate students just keep getting rounded up for these horrible games?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All good questions,” Tsumugi says. “And to find out—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what happens after us?” Tenko talks over her. “Are you just going to find sixteen other Ultimates and force them to kill each other? Are you going to erase our memories and throw us into another game? How do we even know we haven’t already been through this before if we can’t trust our own memories!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whoa, whoa, whoa,” Monokuma says. “Sloooow down! I mean the despair is good, but—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t know what’s going to happen, but there’s going to be more death, isn’t there?” she says. “Tenko almost hopes the world really is destroyed just so you won’t do this to anyone else!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a moment of silence after Tenko’s outburst. A gentle smile spreads over Tsumugi’s face. “And if you were still wondering what despair is… that’s a pretty good example.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Ryoma says. “Don’t talk about her that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko brushes at the beginnings of tears welling in her eyes with the back of her hand. She says, “Tenko can stand up for herself,” though her voice has little bite in it. “She just… she just doesn’t want anyone else to die. And Tenko knows that when this is done there’s going to be more Himikos and Gontas and Kaitos.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a pained sigh. “You think that if it didn’t end with Rantaro, why would it end with us? He probably lost someone who was… kind to him for the first time in a long time, too, and then stood here and thought the same stupid things we are right now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “We’re not going to let that happen. With everything that’s happened, there’s no way Tsumugi’s audience will have faith in her to run another game. And that’s something she isn’t talking about for a reason—we all know the killing game is obsessed with following its own rules, and with how many times Tsumugi has had to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine, I’ll admit it,” Tsumugi interrupts. “You’re right.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Kaede off guard, and she stammers, “H-Huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I did receive quite a few… strongly worded messages, however,” she says. “The mistake you’ve all been making—the mistake you bet Kokichi and Maki’s lives on—is that I care about that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You…” Kaede falters for a second before shaking her head. “No, that’s definitely a lie. Everything you’ve done has been to try and keep the game going to put on a show for your audience. There’s no way you don’t care if they get angry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right, right,” Tsumugi says dismissively. “And if I didn’t care about the rules or whatever, I would have just haw the Exisals mow everyone down on day one. But I already told you what the real goal of this game is: bringing despair to all of you and everyone watching by extension.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Everyone watching?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “That’s right. Ryoma can tell you that the first two killing games were designed to bring despair to their audiences, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pauses, giving Tsumugi a measured look as he responds. “I guess…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe all of you aren’t Hope’s Peak students, but you’re still symbols of hope,” Tsumugi says. “And what’s more despairing than seeing symbols of hope turn on each other over and over again, and every time they get close to stopping the game, the mastermind snatches it away from them? The fact that the game’s unfair just brings more despair, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So this really is all about despair, then?” Kaede asks. “You’re saying our suffering isn’t even about us—you’re just using us as examples for your stupid audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does that mean Tsumugi’s audience… is on our side?” Tenko asks. “Whoever they are, they don’t want us to fall into despair, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma tugs at his hat. “This is starting to sound a lot like the first killing game. Enoshima Junko wasn’t above cheating to try and stop people from ruining her game, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly! You’re all correct!” Tsumugi says. “And with that in mind, who do you think I am? I promise the answer is plain to see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yup, yup, yup!” Monokuma says. “She’s plainly Enoshima Junko!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks. “What.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m Enoshima Junko,” Tsumugi says. “You all thought she died, but you can’t ever really kill despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Where there’s Monokuma,” Monokuma says. “There’s Enoshima Junko—and where there’s Enoshima Junko, there’s Monokuma! We’re a two for one pair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The real Remnant of Despair hiding amongst you all was never Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “But me, Enoshima Junko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s the mastermind behind every game!” Monokuma says. “You can’t have a killing game with Enoshima Junko! Or Monokuma!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi Shirogane was always just a disguise,” Tsumugi says. “Enoshima Junko is who I really am! For real!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A cloud of smoke puffs out of the base of Tsumugi’s podium, obscuring her form for what Kaede counts as a few seconds at most. The smoke dissipates as quickly as it had come, and a girl with massive amounts of pink hair pulled into pigtails decorated with Monokuma’s face stands where Tsumugi had been.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The girl’s voice is rough, as if trying to put on a punk persona, when she talks. “So you figured it out, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Kaede says. “I didn’t say anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words go ignored. “It’s time to ditch that boring disguise and show the world who I really am: Enoshima Junko! Feeling the despair yet?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede spares a quick glance to the others. Tenko has her brow furrowed in vague confusion, whereas Ryoma stares down the supposed mastermind without a hint of surprise. “So,” he says. “Enoshima Junko is dead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Weren’t you just fucking listening?” Junko says. “I already told ya’ you can’t kill despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Tenko says. “What are you doing? Why are you talking like that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Talking like what?” Junko says. “And would you quit calling me that loser’s name? Like I said, I’m Enoshima Junko, baby!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The confusion fades from Tenko’s expression, leaving something frustrated in its place. “Tenko means… you’re not talking like a real person. You sound like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Bored!” Junko shouts. “This guessing game you’ve been going back and forth playing is boring!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede rolls her eyes. “Tsumugi, can we just—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As I already informed you,” Junko says, voice suddenly calm. “The persona of Tsumugi Shirogane was simply one I was using until the time of my reveal. Continuing to refer to me by that name is akin to calling an actor the character they play.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, whatever,” Kaede says. “It doesn’t really matter who you are. You’re still the mastermind—nothing’s changed. Can’t we just vote and kill you already?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I am afraid that is not how the rules of the final trial work,” Junko says. “Though you have made a point to complain about rule changes, mixing things up, so to speak, for the final trial is acceptable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why didn’t you say that earlier?” Ryoma mumbles to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okie dokie!” Junko’s voice rises in pitch to something childish. “So here are the new rules: this isn’t a silly little vote for who killed who, but one for hope and despair! If you all vote for me, then despair loses and you go free! But if even one of you doesn’t, then hope loses and you get to continue your school lives here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede raises an eyebrow. “That doesn’t change anything. None of us have any reason not to vote for you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you sure about that?” Junko asks. “The outside world might just be a teensy bit different from what—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The school is in ruins,” Ryoma says. “Staying here isn’t an option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And even if that wasn’t the case,” Tenko says. “Tenko just wants to go home.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko grins. “Ah-ha! I was hoping one of you would say that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Say what?” Tenko asks, suddenly nervous.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like we were trying to say earlier,” Junko says, accompanied by another personality shift. “The world you came from exists only within your memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We know the world hasn’t been completely destroyed,” Ryoma says. “You couldn’t have an audience if it was.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh-ho, but consider, peasant, what that means,” Junko says. “The world is watching your struggles, yet no one has come to save you. Even after the foolish broadcast you forced upon the world, the game continues.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That does seem to take Ryoma aback a bit, and he retreats to tugging at his hat. “The world is cruel,” he says after a moment. “Already knew that before coming here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Kaede says. “And the condition of the outside world doesn’t matter. Staying here is impossible, and we’re not about to let you live after everything you’ve done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And so it comes back to revenge again!” Junko says. “My, what impudence—to shirk your own life to end another!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can say whatever you want,” Kaede says. “It doesn’t change any—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, Tenko has a question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede whips her head around to face her. “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko is nervously holding her hands to her chest, and her words are directed to the floor. “Tenko knows Kaede said that we can’t trust anything Tsumugi says, but… Kiibo was receiving signals from people watching us, and they never tried to do anything to help us. But if Tsumugi wants to bring despair to that audience, then they must be on our side… but then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She trails off, and Kaede picks up her point. “Why haven’t they helped us escape?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Paints a disturbing picture, doesn’t it?” Junko says in an almost comically downtrodden voice as she tugs at her hair. “An audience that doesn’t want you to despair, but doesn’t want you to escape either? I don’t know what kinda picture that paints of the world, but it sure sounds—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like despair, I’m sure,” Kaede says sharply.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a strained breath. “It’s a good point, though. We’ve been talking about this audience, but we don’t actually know anything about them other than that Tsumugi needed to keep the killing game going to appease them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“An audience who just wants to see you all kill each other in the name of hope,” Junko says. “How despair—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, Tsumugi, can you just knock it off?” Kaede asks. “We know you’re not actually Enoshima Junko, and you’ve said ‘despair’ so many times it doesn’t even sound like a word anymore. If you want me to take you seriously, just stop it already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko pauses for a second, the previous personas she had been putting on melting away completely. “Oh? You sound so certain. How do you know I’m not the real Enoshima Junko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“She’s dead,” Ryoma says again.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Please, as if death ever stopped the Ultimate Despair,” Junko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Okay, fine,” Kaede says. “Besides the logical answer that it is literally impossible for a dead teenager from a killing game that happened years ago to be here, the Mother Monokuma told me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko purses her lips. “Did it now?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Mother Monokuma,” Tenko says. “Kiibo told Tenko a little bit about that. It’s the center of the school that controls everything, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” Kaede says. “And it told me that Enoshima Junko wasn’t running this game. It also said that Tsumugi isn’t a Remnant of Despair, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko stares at her with half lidded eyes before sighing and turning to look at Monokuma giggling behind his paws. “Really?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Really!” he chirps. “But I did happen to also let slip that you are definitely one of Enoshima Junko’s followers.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko contemplates this for a moment before saying. “That’s fair, I guess.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“A stalker hiding outside a celebrity’s bushes is absolutely a follower! So it’s absolutely fair!” Monokuma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko’s lips twist into a scowl. “Well, that comparison’s a bit unnecessary, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is it wrong?” Monokuma asks, voice teasing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Junko huffs crossing her arms. Kaede’s eyes dart between them, trying to gauge exactly what she’s hearing. “Are you two… fighting?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fighting is too strong a word for it,” Junko says. “But that’s not important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does this mean you’re finally admitting that Enoshima isn’t real and you’re just Tsumugi in cosplay?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His question is answered as almost magically, Junko’s appearance reverts back to Tsumugi’s. “I guess, oh,” she clasps her hands. “And I suppose it’s not all bad, since while we’re on the topic, can Kaede tell me why I was able to cosplay as Enoshima Junko just now? This question should be really fast, but I think we should debate it anyway—just to keep the trial moving.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So, maybe I’m not really Enoshima Junko,” Tsumugi says. “And the whole secret identity thing was a lie.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi gave up really easily,” Tenko says. “Is—is this another trap?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No more traps and no more lies, I promise,” Tsumugi says. “In fact, that whole display right now was just a clue about your memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The Flashback Lights gave us memories of Hope’s Peak, the Tragedy, and the Remnants of Despair,” Ryoma says. “But we also know the Flashback Lights were fabricated by the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we can’t trust that any of those things are real,” Tenko says. “But… we don’t even know if there are other memories we were given and can’t trust. Tenko doesn’t remember how she came here, so she doesn’t know what else she doesn’t remember.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s true, too,” Ryoma says. “But think we can safely say this whole Enoshima thing is just bullshit.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… agrees with that,” Tenko says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey, now!” Monokuma says. “Don’t you know not to say such hurtful things around a dedicated fan?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Enoshima Junko…” Kaede says. “She’s not real, is she? You can cosplay her because she’s just a fictional character.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles. “That’s right. You remember my cospox? I know I might be a bit of a liar, but even I can’t fake spontaneously breaking out in a rash.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s just… cosplay,” Tenko says. “So our memories of Hope’s Peak are fake…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pulls at his hat. “And if that’s not real, the first and second killing games aren’t real either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right and right again,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But,” Tenko says, a note of distress creeping into her voice. “Tenko doesn’t get it. What about Rantaro’s game? Rantaro was a real person, wasn’t he? He wasn’t just an actor you hired and killed, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, no,” Tsumugi says. “Rantaro was real. Don’t ask me to cosplay him, unless you want to see something really gross.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then his killing game was real?” Tenko asks. “But that doesn’t make sense—why are some of the games fake and some not?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s gaze darkens slightly. “Because sometimes fiction imitates reality, and sometimes reality imitates fiction.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So what are you then,” Ryoma says, narrowing his eyes. “Some freak copying murders they see on T.V.?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hmm, I think I prefer the term ‘cosplaycat criminal,’” Tsumugi says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Kaede says. “You created this entire game just to copy a T.V. show!? You kidnapped us and messed with our memories just so—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not a T.V. show,” Tsumugi says with a click of her tongue. “It was more than that—it’s practically a cultural phenomenon. Then it became a T.V. show.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gapes at her. “We’re… we’re on T.V.? The people watching us are…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Just fans at home,” Tsumugi says. “Just everyday people tuning into the most popular game on air: Dangan Ronpa!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Dangan Ronpa!” Monokuma cheers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What…” Ryoma breathes out. “That doesn’t…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma pumps his fist in the air again. “Dangan Ronpa!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um, what’s that?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the name of the killing game, of course,” Tsumugi says. “We have many competitors, so it’s necessary to establish your brand and make it memorable.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Which is where I come in!” Monokuma says. “The lovable mascot character! And the five less popular mascot characters from this season to turn into cheap merch.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Season?’” Kaede says. “Wait, does that mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “That there have been previous televised killing games and you guys are just one in a series? You got it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Rantaro’s game… was just another season of a T.V. show?” Tenko asks in horror.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “He was one of the stars of our fifty second season, and you guys are the fifty third!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gapes at her. “There’s… there’s been over fifty killing games?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-How many people dead is that?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma has a grim look on his face. “Over five hundred, at least. Probably more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“This…” Kaede says. “What the hell is this!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s entertainment,” Tsumugi says. “Your memories of the previous killing games have been erased, but you guys should still know what reality T.V. is. Just think of that but with a little more murder!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s sick!” Kaede shouts. “No one would watch something that horrible! You’re lying!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles in amusement. “I’m really not, though. I mean, come on, think of the first killing game: a bunch of super cool Ultimates rounded up together in a high stakes mystery game to decide the philosophic fate of the world? Doesn’t that sound exciting? How could anyone not be interested in that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re killing people for fun,” Tenko says. “Real people are suffering and dying—nothing can make that okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But what if it was fiction?” Tsumugi asks. “You might cry when a character is hurt or dies, but in the end, it’s fine, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s different,” Tenko says. “It’s different with real people with hopes and dreams and families and friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods happily. “Exactly—I’m glad you get it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">A disturbed look crosses over Tenko’s face at her words. “Wha… what?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Killing real people and killing characters is different,” Tsumugi says. “Which is why hosting killing games is totally okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the hell are you saying?” Kaede asks. “How can you say you know how messed up this whole thing is and then just say it’s fine!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not listening, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “I said killing games are fine because they’re not conducted with real people—simple as that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Ryoma says slowly. “We are real. You can’t just say we aren’t.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She laughs. “Oh, I think I can. None of us here are real. I know it, the audience knows it, and now you guys know it, too. That’s why no one has come to try and rescue you. You don’t try to save your favorite character from their fate, right? That would just be ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not making any sense,” Kaede says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I am, you’re just a little bit confused,” Tsumugi says. “Ryoma and Tenko were on the right track, actually, earlier. You guys actually have no idea who you are <i>and</i> you can’t trust any of your memories.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“More Flashback Lights were used on us then,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You should remember, oh, four or so Flashback Lights, I think?” Tsumugi says. “And Ryoma found the encouraging fifth one, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s mouth presses into a thin line as he answers. “I did…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess that makes sense now, too,” Tsumugi says. “Just a little extra kick of hope to have it all come crumbling down in despair at the end. Shame you were the only one who saw it though—really should have gotten the protagonist in on that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop talking about us like that!” Kaede shouts. “Stop lying, stop making things up, and stop trying to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Anyway, about the Flashback Lights,” Tsumugi says. “There was one more way at the beginning when you guys all first arrived. Is there any chance you remember that? Before you stepped out of those lockers the first time. Well, second time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you… asking us to remember a memory you erased?” Tenko asks.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs as she crosses her arms. “No luck then, huh? Oh, well. I suppose I could tell you, but I think you’re pretty set on not believing me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course we are,” Kaede says. “We have no reason to believe anything you say. You’ve shown us no evidence of anything you’re saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know, I know,” Tsumugi says. “Which is why I came prepared with proof. And,” her eyes flash, reveling in whatever she’s about to say, “maybe you won’t believe it if I say it, but you’d believe yourself, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is about to interrogate her on what that means when a monitor lowers from the ceiling. It displays only static for a moment before clearing to a slightly grainy image of an overhead camera looking down on a girl in a plain high school uniform.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede says, “What…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The girl on the screen says, “My name is,” only to be cut off by static. “And I’d like to audition for Dangan Ronpa because, well, I think I’d be good at it. Honestly, I’m perfect for a killing game. I don’t have any faith in humanity.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede?” Tenko asks, voice trembling. “What… what is this?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t…” Kaede starts to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what always gets people killed—trusting the wrong person. But with me, that wouldn’t be a problem, and spreading distrust among everyone else is sure to make things interesting, don’t you think?” the girl says. “That’s always my favorite part of Dangan Ronpa: navigating that kind of atmosphere of paranoia and learning how to manipulate people. Sure killing someone would be fun, but I think the social part of the game is what really makes a season. And since I just naturally don’t trust people, I’m sure it’d only be a matter of time before I betray someone in some exciting way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The video mercilessly returns to fuzz, and when Kaede can bare to take her eyes off the screen, she sees Tsumugi grinning brightly at her. “So, Kaede, what do you think of the old you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Sorry for the delay on this one--I forgot what writing trial chapters was like and also learned why Kodaka never had a trial with less than five characters, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s…” Kaede says. “That’s not real.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles. “Oh, Kaede, you know it is. It’s you from before the first Flashback Light.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma seems only slightly less unnerved than Kaede. “So there were Flashback Lights we don’t remember, and before them…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Before them,” Tsumugi picks up. “You were all dedicated fans happy to audition.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We,” Tenko says. “We auditioned?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede keeps staring at the screen even after the image of herself disappears. She feels numb, almost distant from her body as she mumbles, “Kokichi said something like that. He thought we might have volunteered.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And he guessed right,” Tsumugi says. “You can’t host a killing game with unwilling participants. That would just be unethical.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“N-No!” Tenko shouts. “That doesn’t make any sense! No one would sign up for something as horrible as this! No one would watch something as horrible as this! Whatever you just showed us is fake—there’s no other explanation!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi turns her gaze on her, glasses shining dangerously. “Okay. Then tell me how it’s fake.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“H-Huh?” Tenko falters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Video evidence is pretty conclusive if you ask me,” Tsumugi says. “So tell me how I faked it. If you’re going to accuse me of lying you have to have a theory to back it up, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Um,” Tenko says, confidence draining from her voice. “You can dress up like other people, so that’s probably just you in the video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “Nope. I can’t cosplay as real people, remember? Come on, Tenko, you can do better than that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko flinches at her words. She briefly looks to Kaede for help to see her still completely zoned in on the blank screen. “It’s,” she says. “Tenko still doesn’t believe it’s real because… because Kaede isn’t like that. She would never say things like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, she wouldn’t now,” Tsumugi says. “But before her memories were altered for the killing game, she absolutely did. I already explained the first Flashback Light that gave you memories of your ultimate talents, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You… mentioned it,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, well, I suppose you could put two and two together at this point,” Tsumugi says. “But the truth is that all of your talents, back stories, and memories are fake. Everything you remember from before the game was written by a member of our staff to make you more interesting.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Tenko says. “What are you saying? That doesn’t make any sense—Tenko is Tenko and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Tenko Chabashira was the creation of one of our writers,” Tsumugi says. “If you don’t believe me, you can always see for yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen at the threat. “No! That’s not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Huh?” Tsumugi says. “You seem scared all of a sudden, but that doesn’t make any sense. It’s just a lie, right? So why are you afraid of seeing what I have to show you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“B-Because,” Tenko stammers. “It’s a trick,” she decides on. “You’re just trying to trick and confuse us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But if you don’t believe in a lie, it shouldn’t hold any power over you,” Tsumugi says. “So it shouldn’t be a problem to watch another video I have, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quit tormenting her,” Ryoma says. “Just leave her alone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clicks her tongue. “Hey now, I’m the one being attacked here. Tenko accused me of lying when I promised I would tell the truth, and now I’m just trying to set things straight. And besides, hasn’t Tenko always hated people keeping secrets?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up,” Ryoma says. “Stop acting like you’re doing us a favor or something. We all know what your real goal is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I sure would hope so,” Tsumugi says. “After all I told you upfront that my goal was to bring you all to despair. Personally, I think I’m doing a pretty good job so far. I mean, learning that your personalities are all fake and you have no where to go back to is pretty rough, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sends a pointed glance to Kaede, still reeling from what she had been shown. “It’s all pretty tragic,” Tsumugi continues, “when you consider the fact that everything has been scripted. All your relationships and feelings were just little plots for your characters.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma’s gaze darkens. “That’s a lie. Your game went off the rails—you basically admitted it yourself. You don’t have that kind of control over us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh maybe a few of our creations got a bit out of hand, sure,” Tsumugi says. “But trust me, they were the exceptions. And even for the ones that were a bit hard to handle, their personalities were fake, too. Actually,” she claps her hands. “Would you all like to see the real Kokichi and Maki? They died so bravely to end the game that I think it’s only fair you get to see how much they loved it beforehand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Before anyone can protest, the monitor flicks back on. This time, an identical but somehow plainer version of Kokichi looks up at the camera. His voice lacks its characteristic mischief and the raw honesty is somehow deeply unsettling as he says, “I think being in a killing game would be really exciting. If I got in, I know I would do whatever I could to entertain the audience.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His image fuzzes away, replaced with one of Maki. She wrings her hands nervously as she says, “is there any way to guarantee we get a certain role? Because I want—no, need—to be a killer. The only reason I watch Dangan Ronpa is for the killers, and I only want to be on the show if I can get to be one.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Like with Kaede’s video before, the screen turns to fuzz when Maki finishes speaking. Kaede distantly watches the images flickering before her. Maki and Kokichi had both angered her more than anyone during the game, but something about hearing those words coming from their mouths feels offensive.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs. “It’s kind of funny when you think about it. Kaede, Kokichi, and Maki were more desperate to end the killing game than anyone else, and they’re only like that <i>because</i> of the killing game. If they hadn’t been picked, they probably all would have been at home, eagerly watching.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not true,” Kaede says softly. “That’s not us. We don’t know those people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, come on, quit lying to yourselves,” Tsumugi says. “You’re all fictional characters created to kill each other in this fictional world. The sooner you accept that fact, the sooner we can move on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Move on to what?” Ryoma says darkly. “More torture?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re the one who wanted more information,” Tsumugi says. “You wanted the truth about your situation, so I’m giving it to you. Don’t shoot the messenger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “and you’re saying our situation is… us and everyone else who died—we were all just created to kill each other?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“To entertain the audience,” Kaede says. “Kokichi said the point was to entertain the audience—that there are certain points where we’re supposed to win or ‘overcome despair’ because that’s what the audience wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Kokichi also said that he wanted the killing game to be exciting before he even got in,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Tenko says. “Kokichi may have had a horrible personality, but that was the last thing he wanted. He gave his life to protect us and end the game—you can’t just say that didn’t happen.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi waves a hand dismissively. “Calm down. There’s no need to get so upset. All I’m saying is that Kokichi was just a product of his environment like everyone else who signed up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I assume none of us want to know what that means,” Ryoma says. “But you’re going to tell us anyway.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You got it,” Tsumugi says with a laugh. “You all came from a world so advanced that all of its problems have been solved, and there is just too much peace. Everyone is bored out of their minds, and, well, what gets people going more than the heart pounding emotions generated by a killing game?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… that’s sick,” Tenko says. “Tenko wants nothing to do with a world like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well,” Tsumugi says. “Your options are either to go back to that world or to stay here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We already said it’s impossible to stay at the school,” Ryoma says. “It’s been destroyed. There’s nothing here for us anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s gaze darkens. “Maybe—but which would cause more suffering? Staying in the ruins and rebuilding or being forced out into a world that cheered when all of your friends died?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her words are met with a moment of silence. Kaede softly mumbles, “I don’t want anything to do with that world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t seem to hear her as she says, “is it impossible to regain our lost memories?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You mean go back to who you were before the killing game?” Tsumugi says. “Are you sure you even want that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko hugs herself. “No. Tenko doesn’t know what she was like, and she also knows that if she pushes it, you’re just going to show her some horrible video.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs. “Am I really that predictable?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes,” Ryoma says. “Now just tell us what the hell you want from us already.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “It’s not about what I want. The outcome of the vote is completely up to you: hope or despair. You guys have complained enough about how much you hate trials, so I’ll let you end this one early. Just go ahead and vote for whichever option you think is best.” She smiles. “I’m sure you’ll make the right choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only options,” Tsumugi says, “are hope and despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s a sick euphemism for it,” Ryoma mutters.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can either choose despair and rebuild your lives here,” Tsumugi says. “Or you can choose hope and try and make it a world that you don’t belong in anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that really all there is to it?” Tenko asks. “We go outside or we don’t?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you boil it down, basically,” Tsumugi says. “I’ll also be executed if you pick hope.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What the hell does ‘hope’ even mean?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It means you’ve overcome the horrible despair of your existence as nothing more than fictional characters and are willing to brave the fact that you have no futures,” Tsumugi says. “What’s more hopeful than holding on to such blind optimism in the face of utter despair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Despair, hope…” Tenko says. “Both sound horrible… Tenko doesn’t want either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Too bad,” Tsumugi says. “Because hope and despair are the only outcomes of this game! Those are the rules!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s the Dangan Ronpa way!” Monokuma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait,” Kaede says, life finally flickering back in her eyes. “The rules…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The rules are the rules,” Tsumugi says. “Of course, you’re more than welcome to find out exactly what happened to Maki and Kaito if you feel like breaking them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw. “Just… shut up and answer my question.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, that’s the spirit,” Tsumugi says. “You had me thinking I finally got you to fall into despair back there. Although,” she taps her chin in thought. “Is that fighting spirit or is that aggressiveness just your old self? It’s kind of hard to tell with you sometimes, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede barely stops herself from flinching at the accusation. “I get it—you showed me that video not because I used to be someone horrible and manipulative but because I still am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede!” Tenko says. “That’s not true! You’re nothing like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I am. No matter how much I try to trust or believe, my instincts won’t let me. If I was turned into a fictional character, Tsumugi did a pretty terrible job of erasing my old personality.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a short laugh. “That’s certainly a way to look at it. I suppose I miscalculated how much you hate yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not it,” Kaede says. “I just… I know who I am. And I know you’re the same way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Tsumugi off guard, and she raises an eyebrow in response. “Oh? Isn’t that something the villain says to the hero not the other way around?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“See?” Kaede says. “You’re admitting it—you think you’re fictional, too. You’re exactly the same as us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I wasn’t denying that,” Tsumugi says. “I just think it’s interesting you made that connection is all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what do you think about this connection,” Kaede says. “Monokuma said at the beginning of this trial that the rules state there can only be two survivors, but now you’re saying the only way we can leave is if we choose hope. What happens to the third person if we do what you say?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s smile turns dark. “I’m glad you asked.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The confidence that had been building within Kaede falters at Tsumugi’s calm answer. Tenko says, “The two person rule… Rantaro had said that was important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, it was very important to him,” Tsumugi says. “It’s why he ended up in another killing game, after all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“He… what?” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That was a good catch, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “The rules are very strict that only two of you will be leaving even if you do pick hope. The third person will be sacrificed and become a contestant in the next killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s eyes widen. “There really are going to be more killing games.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” Tsumugi says. “And one of you will get to see it first hand as the new Ultimate Survivor! And since I’m such a nice person, I’ll even let you vote which one of you it is. So,” she looks at each of them in turn expectantly, “who volunteers?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No one!” Tenko shouts. “If that is the rule, then we choose despair!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko?” Ryoma says. “We can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t care!” Tenko says. “Tenko will live out the rest of her life here before she sacrifices someone else!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I told you despair is the right choice,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Ryoma says. “It’s not. Already told you this isn’t even a choice. And,” he sighs, “it turns out I was right—maybe my memories are all fake, but I really don’t have anyone out there for me. At least, not anyone who would stop me from signing up for a killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shakes her head. “Ryoma, she is trying to trick you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Trick me into what?” Ryoma says. “The only trick is that I thought I might have had a future for five minutes. So,” he looks at Tsumugi. “I’ll do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede blinks at him. “Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Tenko screams again, gripping the edge of her podium in frustration. “Tenko won’t let you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He lets out a deep sigh. “Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you go into another killing game, you’re not just killing yourself, but everyone else Tsumugi will trick into signing up,” Tenko says. “You said you weren’t going to hurt us like that ever again!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma tugs at his hat, lowering it over his face. “Well, what the hell else are we supposed to do?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stay here!” Tenko says. “We just stay in the school and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Already told you that’s not a possibility,” Ryoma fires back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows the school is destroyed,” she says. “But we could still manage, and anything is better than another killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe that last part is true,” Ryoma says. “But think about it—if this really is a T.V. show or whatever, then there’s no way staying here for the rest of our lives is an option.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi clicks her tongue. “Oh come now, you don’t think that I was lying about one of your options, do you? Our team here at Dangan Ronpa would be happy to feed and support you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a dark look. “As I was saying—there’s no way we can trust that. Some of us walking free as a guarantee is better than all of us dying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And guaranteeing that one of us goes to another killing game is worse than anything,” Tenko says. “And—and if one of us does have to, it should be Tenko.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede looks to her. “Tenko…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can’t be serious,” Ryoma says. “You just said—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko just said she would rather die than live because she sacrificed people,” Tenko says. “Tenko is still voting for despair, but if she loses, then she’ll go to the next game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah, but if despair wins,” Tsumugi says. “Then the outside world will fall to despair. Who will bring hope to all of the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fuck the outside world,” Ryoma snaps at her before turning back to Tenko. “Tenko, you know what happened to Rantaro almost better than anyone. Volunteering is the same as killing yourself now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko remains firm, crossing her arms defensively. “And Tenko would rather that happens to her than killing one of her friends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re not killing me if I go,” Ryoma says. “I’ve already made my peace, and I’ve been fine with this outcome for a long time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shouts something else at him as Kaede bites her lip, looking between them volleying back and forth. Her hands subconsciously clench into fists as her last two remaining friends both keep arguing how they should be the one to die. And Kaede glances across the courtroom to Tsumugi, all too pleased at the scene before her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Tenko doesn’t have a future either! If she was just written by someone to die, then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then we’re the same, and it still doesn’t make sense for you to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop,” Kaede says. Neither hear her, and she squeezes her eyes shut for a moment before raising her voice. “I said stop.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They both abruptly cut themselves off, and Tenko turns to stare at her in horror. “Kaede,” she says. “Not you, too…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I’m not volunteering. I just wanted to say something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, go ahead, Kaede,” Tsumugi says. “I’m sure we’d all love to hear it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends her a brief glare before shifting her focus back to Ryoma and Tenko. “I just thought, standing here, hearing you both scream about how you should be the sacrifice—this is torture.” She points at Tsumugi. “This is Tsumugi torturing us. This is still part of the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, of course it is,” Tsumugi says with a laugh. “I told you this is how the game ends.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what I’m saying,” Kaede says. “I mean that picking hope and suffering like this—forcing us to go through the same pain of losing each other again—is still part of the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stops laughing, though her smile remains in place. She repeats, “Like I said, the rules state—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ryoma was right, wasn’t he?” Kaede says. “Despair isn’t a real option, and you have no intentions of us picking it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What makes you say that?” Tsumugi asks. “Come now, if you’re going to argue with me, why don’t you present some evidence?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re supposed to pick hope,” Tsumugi says. “Now just what led you to that conclusion?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Like I said,” Ryoma interjects. “Picking despair is impossible just logistically speaking.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But it’s better than hope,” Tenko says. “Picking hope… picking hope is terrible. Why would anyone agree to something so horrible?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not the one voting,” Tsumugi says. “It’s all up to you guys to bring hope to the world. My only task is to bring the world to despair, starting with you three. Why wouldn’t I let you fall deep, deep down into the depths of despair?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“All this hope and despair talk is really firing me up!” Monokuma cheers. “And if you feel the same way, check out our website for how to become a sponsor and receive even more hope and despair!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi raises an eyebrow at him. “Bit of an odd time to do a plug, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“One of us has to keep the money rolling in,” Monokuma replies dully. “I’m not gonna be able to roll in salmon if we’re not rolling in dough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your audience,” Kaede says. “You don’t actually want to ‘bring them despair.’ You want to entertain them so they’ll keep watching us—so your sick show will be successful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles back at her. “Those things aren’t mutually exclusive, you know. Our audience loves despair—the emotional rollercoaster of having your hopes brought up and up, only to come crashing down. You don’t understand what the world outside is like. They have too much hope so they need a little despair, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t believe that,” Kaede says. “Ryoma,” she turns to him. “When we were in the school you found a Flashback Light that gave you memories meant to motivate you, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right…” he says. “Did think it seemed strange that the mastermind would prepare something like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, obviously I didn’t use it,” Tsumugi says. “And even if I did, what’s so strange about raising your hopes only to crush them? Despair needs hope and hope shines brightest when it overcomes despair. It’s a cycle, and to get one you need to instill the other.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede points an accusing finger at her. “What you said just now proves it. ‘Hope shines brightest when it overcomes despair.’ This isn’t a real choice or a real challenge—it’s just something you made up to make us think we were going to fail right at the end to create some sort of grand finale.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can think that as much as you want,” Tsumugi says. “But it doesn’t change the fact that—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That we’re supposed to win,” Kaede says. “That’s what Kokichi thought. Every trial—including this one—they’re designed for us to win so that your audience can get their happy ending.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And continue the cycle…” Tenko picks up.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s right,” Kaede says. “Tsumugi would let us think we had a chance so we would keep trying—if we just gave up ‘in despair’ or were all killed at the beginning, then her audience wouldn’t be entertained. Kokichi said that the game was designed for us to succeed sometimes so we would keep playing, and that’s the truth, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shrugs in response. “Sure, if you feel like relying on Kokichi’s logic. But I already showed you what the real Kokichi was like, don’t you remember?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede falters slightly at that. “Th-That doesn’t matter. I… I accept whoever I was before, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you accept who everyone else was?” Tsumugi says. “Oh, Kaede, you’re such a caring person that it matters more to you that your beloved friends were good people then that you were.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course Kaede wants to believe in her friends. We all do,” Tenko says. “Tenko’s friends who she couldn’t save are the reason she’s still fighting and why she refuses to lose anyone else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sees Tsumugi’s lips quirk into a smile at roughly the same time she registers Tenko’s mistake. Ryoma catches it, too, calling out, “Tenko, don’t say things like—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Friends you couldn’t save, friends you had to leave behind,” Tsumugi muses. “All of your friends that were created to die specifically to motivate you. Well, I certainly would hope that their scripted deaths are keeping you going. Our writers worked very hard to make sure each and every killing seemed meaningful.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey!” Kaede interrupts. “Don’t change the topic like that! Answer my question: we’re meant to pick hope, aren’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know who I think everyone here really liked? Kaito! It really is a shame all of his motivational speeches and comforting words weren’t real,” Tsumugi says. “Because he was just a fictional character like all of us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma echoes, “‘all of us…’” to himself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t hear him. Though seeing herself and Maki and Kokichi say such horrible things had shaken her, Kaede is all too aware that seeing someone like Kaito or Tenko be smeared is different. “That’s—” Kaede shouts. “That’s not true! You can’t hold that over us because it’s not true!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi sighs. “Kaede, weren’t you paying attention earlier? Tenko said the same thing, and I already told her that if you want to argue, you need proof.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—” Kaede stammers for a second. “I…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what I thought,” Tsumugi says. “If you have any more theories, I’d be happy to debunk them, but, really, don’t you think it’s easier if you just accept it at this point? All of you volunteered, had your original personalities erased, and became fictional characters in order to participate in the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances to Tenko, holding her hands close to heart and seemingly on the verge of tears, then to Ryoma, staring hard on the ground. Tsumugi smirks as she takes them all in as well. “It seems you’re all finally starting to understand the situation you’re in. Everything in this game from the very beginning has been scripted to lead us to this point. The plotlines where you would fall in love or forge ‘unbreakable bonds’ were all written out long beforehand. Your words, your actions, and even your very thoughts are all fiction. And fiction has no place in the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That… that doesn’t matter,” Kaede says. “Because I promised I would kill you, and that’s what I’m going to do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, of course you are,” Tsumugi smiles. “Because that’s what your character was written to do from the very beginning: kill the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw and looks around again, as if something in the trial room would give her the argument she needs. The monitor remains mercifully blank—Tsumugi’s plan to taunt them with more videos seemingly abandoned for the time being—Ryoma and Tenko are unresponsive, Monokuma is grinning happily up on his throne while Tsumugi smirks at her, and all of the portraits of her dead friends are lined up dutifully as always.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Shuichi’s portrait is across from her. It has stared her dead in the face for so long, that any affect it may have had has long since faded. Black and white with a smear of blood on his X almost blotting out his one visible eye completely, the other hidden behind his hat.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. She doesn’t feel any comfort radiating from it, nor any of the boiling anger from when she had swore to kill in his name. Her eyes trail down to the hat she had discarded on the ground next to her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe,” Kaede says. “That is true. Before everything, I was someone horrible, then you changed me, and I wanted nothing more than to kill you. And I still do.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi seems slightly unnerved by Kaede’s calmness, even as she replies. “So you’ve accepted it then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I think it’s all one big lie. I know it’s all one big lie. Because…” she looks up at Tsumugi. “I might want the same thing I did at the beginning, but I’m not the same person. I’ve outgrown your character—we all have.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do you really think that highly of yourself?” Tsumugi asks, raising an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “No, you said it all before: I’m bitter and cynical and I don’t like that about myself. But that’s not who you wanted me to be, either. And then you said the same thing to Tenko: she’s different than how you imagined she would be.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">That catches Tenko’s attention enough for her to look up at Kaede. “Kaede? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I mean,” Kaede says. “That you’re so different that Tsumugi admitted she can’t predict you anymore. You, me, and Ryoma, too—maybe we were originally created for this game, but we’ve more than taken back control of our lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, what, because you’ve developed?” Tsumugi asks, a not of hostility in her voice. “That’s what fictional characters do. They have scripted plotlines and then—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what about you?” Ryoma adds. “You said ‘all of us’ are fictional characters. So you wrote your own personality?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi waves a hand. “You’re over thinking it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I’m not,” he says. “Are you real or are you fiction?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well, of course I’m fiction,” Tsumugi huffs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then show us your video,” Tenko says. “If your personality was written over, too, then you have to be like us, right? Did you just audition like all of us and then were turned into the mastermind?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “Tsumugi Shirogane is just a character, but I’m not a participant or survivor the same way all of you are. If you must know, the situation is that you’re the players, and I’m a construct of the game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t think that’s true,” Kaede says. “I don’t think any of this is true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then show me proof that I’m lying,” Tsumugi says. “You can tell me what you believe in your heart about yourself as much as you want, but I’m telling you that your feelings are—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fiction. You,” Kaede’s eyes flicker over Tsumugi, not in the aggressive glares she had given her earlier but something evaluative. “You really believe what you’re saying is the truth, don’t you? You’ve repeated your own lie back to yourself so many times that you think it’s real. That’s how you’re justify everything you’ve done to us—we’re just characters to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns. “Is that honestly—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko talks over her. “Do you think that if Tsumugi could see that we were really… she would let us go? Or maybe just feel remorse? She could still change…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s staring at her with hopeful eyes, and all Kaede can think about is how Kaito had told her he doesn’t think there is such a thing as an irredeemable person. Kaede feels something sour in her throat as she responds, “I don’t know, but… I doubt it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko’s expression tightens as she simply responds, “So… that is what Kaede really thinks…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you really trying to psychoanalyze me?” Tsumugi cuts in. “I already told you: I am the mastermind hiding in plain sight. That is my character. We are all characters in Dangan Ronpa, and we can all only exist in Dangan Ronpa. There is no ‘changing’ or ‘outgrowing’ no matter how much you try and convince yourselves because that’s not how this works!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No…” Ryoma says slowly. “Starting to think Kaede was right. Kind of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“‘Kind of?’” Kaede echoes. “Did you figure something else out, Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think so,” Ryoma answers. “Though we should ask Tsumugi since…” his eyes cast over Tsumugi. “Still unsure how much she’s deluding herself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s previous haughty composure is almost completely gone as she snarls at him in the next debate.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know how you all got this into your heads,” Tsumugi says. “But you’re all fiction and nothing more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re admitting our thoughts are our own,” Tenko says. “Tenko knew her feelings were real…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“They’re not!” Tsumugi says. “They were scripted! There’s a writing credit on everything in this world! This world is the ultimate real fiction, and we’re all characters in it!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re characters,” Ryoma says. “That’s what you think.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course it is because it’s the truth!” Tsumugi shouts. “Nothing here is real and that’s that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey,” Tenko says softly. “Tsumugi said earlier that Rantaro was real, didn’t she?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma smiles. “Glad you caught that, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As in he was a real character and not an actor,” Tsumugi huffs. “No matter how you try to twist my words, the truth doesn’t change. You can pick at it for as long as you like, but as long as you’re fiction—which you are—there is no other choice but for you to accept the story you were written!”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says. “I understand now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So we’re all on the same page then,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks so, too,” Tenko chimes in.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi is fuming when she speaks. “Obviously, no, <i>plainly</i> none of you understand anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I can explain it for you,” Kaede says. “Isn’t that what you want my ‘character’ to do, after all? Solve mysteries?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There isn’t a mystery,” Tsumugi fires back. “Because I already told you the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And that truth is a lie you’ve tricked yourself into believing for so long that you convinced yourself it was real,” Kaede says. “And I refuse to abide by your reality for even another second.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Alright!” Tsumugi shouts, throwing her hands in the air. “Just what is it that is making you so sure!? Because there is nothing, and that is the honest truth!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede straightens her shoulders, finding her center while Tsumugi unravels. “You—you’re why we’re all so sure.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—what!?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your words and what you really believe don’t line up,” Kaede says. “You told us that Rantaro was both a real person and a fictional character.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Because it’s real fiction,” Tsumugi says. “Fiction using real people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Kaede says. “If that is true, and Rantaro and everyone else are just fictional characters parading around in the bodies of real people, why did you tell us you can’t cosplay as him?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. She starts to say, “Because I can’t—” and cuts herself off abruptly.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you truly think I’m fictional,” Kaede says. “Then show me proof. You tried it once, and I’m fine with you trying it again. Dress up as me. Be me. Show me I’m not real to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t respond but her pale face, tightly clenched jaw, and sweat beading on her forehead speak for her.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says. “You can’t, can you? Tsumugi, you do know that we’re real, and you’ve been hurting us because—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “No, no, no—you don’t get it. This is fiction! All of this is fiction! We were born for this story, and we die when it ends! That’s it! Why don’t you get that!? Look! Look at this and tell me you’re not fiction!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Not just the previous monitor, but every display in the room flicks on in a flurry. Each shows what Kaede realizes is a different audition tape, all playing at once.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’ve told me over and over,” Kaede says, “that the truth is only what everyone believes—what you convince yourself. And,” she looks to Tenko and Ryoma each in turn, “I know what we believe, and the truth is, no matter what you say, you believe it, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s ridiculous!” Tsumugi screams. “You can’t just make something up because it’s more convenient for you!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “It takes a lot to change who you are, but that’s exactly what we’ve done. But even before everything, we were real people. It’s impossible just to take someone’s humanity away, and you know that. No matter how much you distanced yourself from what you were doing by calling us ‘characters,’ you knew you were hurting real people, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s eyes burn with rage, but she doesn’t respond other than clenching her jaw in fury.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma giggles. “Looks like they got you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” Tsumugi snaps at him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs. “She’s not going to accept it. Sometimes it doesn’t matter how you right are about something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I guess not,” Kaede says. “But I think it’s safe to say that we’re done with this conversation, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks so,” Tenko says. “Um, Tenko also wants to say something else.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s still arguing with Monokuma, but Kaede blithely ignores her as she says to Tenko, “sure, go ahead. I don’t think we have to talk about whatever Tsumugi wants anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko nods. “Tenko just wanted to say, um, Ryoma,” he blinks up at her in surprise at the address but remains silent as she continues. “Earlier you said we didn’t have futures because of this game and what Tsumugi did to us, but… do you still think that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma pauses for a second. Then, “Not sure. Figured since our personalities and memories were created, we had no place to go or purpose but,” he sends a meaningful look to Kaede. “Think we proved that’s not true. Whatever happens next is probably going to be pretty brutal, but… we don’t just stop existing, do we?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And as long as we exist, we have a future,” Kaede says. “Maybe that’s not the most optimistic thing, but it’s true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is glad,” Tenko says. “She knows she picked despair, but… Tenko doesn’t want to stay here forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma gives her a knowing half smile. “Didn’t think you did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah, I think staying stuck in ‘fiction land’ starts to do things to your head after a while, too,” Kaede says, sending a pointed look towards Tsumugi. “Kind of a cautionary tale for when you can’t separate yourself from fiction and accept reality, if you think about it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You say that,” Ryoma says. “But are we accepting reality?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks we are,” Tenko says. “Thinking you can never change or shouldn’t try… that’s not reality.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s not, and,” Kaede says, standing up straighter. “Now that we know exactly where we stand with this game, I think we need to make our own choice.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh?” Monokuma says, cutting into their conversation. “Are you talking about the vote?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-That’s right!” Tsumugi says. “No matter what you think, the only way out of this game is by choosing hope or despair!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “I don’t believe that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What do you mean you ‘don’t believe?’” Tsumugi says. “Hope and despair are your only options, and if you refuse to vote, you die. You’re not really about to throw your lives away after making it this far, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Those are the choices you’ve given us,” Kaede says. “But I don’t think I’m going to listen to you anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you try and leave the trial, you’ll be killed,” Tsumugi says. “And you can’t just walk out of the killing game, either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what, exactly, do you intend to do?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I intend to beat the killing game,” Kaede says. “And make sure you’re punished for everything you’ve done to us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a short laugh. “Oh, is this ‘the one to defeat the killing game is not to play?’ Well, I already told you that if you do that, you die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you don’t want that to happen, either, do you?” Kaede asks. “If we all just die at the end, then your audience would be really upset, wouldn’t they? They would hate that ending, and your fictional world would die along with us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi narrows her eyes. “What are you getting at?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What Kaede’s trying to say,” Ryoma says. “Is that we’re the ones with all the power.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How do you have power?” Tsumugi scoffs. “You do what the rules say or you die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Or,” Kaede says. “You do what we say or your whole show—all fifty-three seasons—ends here. Or actually, your show is probably going to end either way, given everything that’s happened. You just get to decide if it’s with a bang or whimper.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No survivors or four survivors,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks that four would be preferable…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Three survivors,” Kaede says. “Tsumugi still gets her wish to die at the end.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko bites her lip. “The game ends with the three of us escaping, and Tsumugi being executed—that’s what Kaede wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you think that’s really a possibility?” Tsumugi says. “I’m just as capable of being as spiteful as you, Kaede. I can vote, and you can all die. Dangan Ronpa ends with despair winning once and for all.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re lying,” Kaede says. “You can’t actually accept an ending like that. You already proved you can’t handle reality—Dangan Ronpa ending would destroy you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “I think I’ve heard enough. You can say you’re in control as much as you want, but at the end of the day, I have the power to kill you right now.” She looks up at Kaede, her glasses shining dangerously. “And I’m calling your bluff on betting your lives.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You think we wouldn’t?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tsumugi says. “You all want to live too much—I can see it. I don’t think any of you are willing to die to prove a point to a world you hate. Maybe you’d sacrifice yourself to save your friends, sure, but Kaede, you’re the only person here who would actually die just for revenge.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is about to contradict her when she notices Tenko fidgeting restlessly in the corner of her vision. Tenko keeps her gaze focused on the ground, refusing to meet Kaede’s eyes. “That…” Kaede says. “That doesn’t matter.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Your plan to defeat the killing game by playing it even harder is only going to get you so far,” Tsumugi says. “You need everyone on your side, and that’s not going to happen. Tenko?” Tenko’s head snaps up at the address towards her. “Are you willing to risk your life so Kaede can murder someone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not what’s happening here,” Kaede says. “And we’re not letting you manipulate us anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi ignores her. “What about you, Ryoma? Do you want to throw away your chance at a future? Do either of you want to be responsible for more killing games?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma tugs at his hat. He takes far too much time to eventually say, “Kaede’s right… we’re not listening to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And all of this,” Tsumugi says, “is based on how much you think you know me. Do you really think I wouldn’t take the people who destroyed my life’s work down with me?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. The control she had so confidently claimed only moments earlier begins to slip through her fingers with each word out of Tsumugi’s mouth. She squeezes her eyes closed, trying to push an answer to come to her through sheer force of will.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “‘Down with you?’ You’d die, too?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course,” Tsumugi says. “That’s why I don’t care—I’m dying either way. It’s just a question of if you all want to die with me.” She laughs. “Poor Kiibo will be left all alone wondering what happened.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo…” Kaede says. Then louder, “Kiibo, we need to talk to you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi frowns at her. “I didn’t mean—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The screen that had shown the videos before flicks on, Kiibo’s face front and center this time. “Yes, Kaede?” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Have you been listening in this whole time?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I have,” he says. “I currently have power over all the school’s recording systems.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then,” Tenko says. “Why didn’t you come arlier?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a sigh. “If you say no one asked you to…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh no,” Kiibo says. “I have simply been testing… more creative uses of my current power over the school.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What does that mean?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi scowls. “Kiibo is dead and will not be participating in this trial.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I called him for a very specific reason.” She shifts to point at Tsumugi. “If risking our lives is the problem, then I’ll find a solution. After everything you’ve put me through, nothing you could say would make me give up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yes, yes, you’re very determined,” Tsumugi says. “But Kiibo is supposed to solve that problem how?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said I’m trying to stop the killing game by playing it better than you,” Kaede says. “But instead, I’m going to stop it by taking it over.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I didn’t say ‘better than—’” Tsumugi cuts herself off. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko shoots her a nervous look. “Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “Just now you said you’ve been getting creative with what you can do. Be honest with me, at this point, how much power does the mastermind actually have?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Th-There’s really no need to answer that!” Monokuma says, sweating bullets. “B-Because there’s n-no way a robot could outsmart a bear or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At this juncture, the Monokuma in this room is the only thing I believe I do not have direct control over,” Kiibo says. “Monokuma still has the ability to call in extra weaponry from the outside as he did earlier somehow… but I believe he would have a bit of trouble getting the signal out from down here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pales as she sends a panicked look up to Monokuma. He does little to assuage her nerves as he stammers, “C-C’mon, just because w-we’re underground doesn’t mean something as crazy as that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Normally that would be the case,” Kiibo says. “But I suspected this trial would be dangerous, so I took it upon myself while you were arguing to seal this room. Controlling an elevator is barely even half a step above controlling the doors in this academy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So it’s safe to say Kiibo has complete power as long as we’re down here,” Ryoma says. “That changes things a bit. You think so, too, right Tsumugi?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t respond. Monokuma says, “knew we shouldn’t have listened to that fan poll about adding a robot…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko says, “Kaede, did you know about all this? Is that why you called for Kiibo?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I actually had no idea,” Kaede says. “There was only one thing that I knew Kiibo had control over that I knew would help us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whatever it is, I will be sure to do my best to help,” Kiibo says. “As I cannot leave the school, I would like to dedicate my last acts to ensure your escape.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Good. Kiibo,” Kaede says, her gaze growing intense as she stares down Tsumugi. “I want you to execute Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There is a pause. Then Tenko breaths out, “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s… a thing Kiibo can do?” Ryoma acts, his voice surprised though nowhere near as aghast as Tenko’s.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods. “It is. Kiibo told me earlier that Miu gave him the power to stop Monokuma’s executions if they use technology. And if he can stop them, then why can’t we use him to create one ourselves?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I…” Kiibo says, “do believe I have the ability to do that. Is that your request then, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi recovers from her panic enough to say, “S-So what? You know if I die, you’re all still trapped here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “I want you to use all of the assets Monokuma set aside to execute us and use them to create an execution so big that it will kill Tsumugi and take down the whole school with her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is that even possible?” Ryoma asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It will take me a second to prepare,” Kiibo says. “But given the sheer magnitude of firepower specifically reserved for Monokuma’s punishments… I believe I could accomplish something of that magnitude.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But wait,” Tenko says. “If that’s true, couldn’t Kiibo just destroy the school without harming anyone?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is also within my power, yes,” Kiibo says. “I should warn everyone to be wary of falling debris in either case due to the nature of the cage.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think that’s a risk we’re all willing to take,” Kaede says. “Because now, we don’t even need to bet our lives at all. We win and you lose, Tsumugi. That’s how this ends”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pauses for a moment. “I lost…” She furrows her brow in concentration. “I see.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her lack of distress is unsettling, but Kaede continues on. “Here’s what’s going to happen—we’re going to walk out of here, and you’re going to experience all the pain you put everyone you executed through a hundred times over. And then, your sick show is going to be finished. No more killing games, no more Dangan Ronpa, no more anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t…” Tsumugi says. “I don’t want to live in a world without Dangan Ronpa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you’re not going to,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shifts, moving to hug herself. “I never… really got it before. I tried to imagine it, but I couldn’t quite get it. But, of course, the ultimate real fiction could do it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Do… what?” Tenko softly asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I wanted to live in the world of Dangan Ronpa and experience everything, and now I have,” Tsumugi says. “I now know exactly what she must have left like at the very beginning.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Who are you talking about?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ignore her,” Kaede says. “She’s just rambling now to try and save her life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I wouldn’t do anything like that now,” Tsumugi says. “I knew as soon as I agreed to be the mastermind that I would die, but even then I didn’t think I would actually die feeling the amount of despair Enoshima Junko must have felt. I,” her face lights up, “I really did it. I became a mastermind just as strong and despicable and full of despair as Enoshima Junko, didn’t I?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s a beat of silence as Tsumugi’s words sink in. Ryoma hesitantly asks, “You’re… fine with this then?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m more than fine,” Tsumugi says. “I knew I could already hold my head up high as a cosplaycat criminal, but now I can do even more than that. This is… this is the perfect ending for Dangan Ronpa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s face twists in revulsion. “There’s something wrong with you. I think I’d be less disgusted if you plead for your life or something, but you’re not even human enough to do that, are you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says, a note of severity creeping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I have no intention of begging for you to spare me,” Tsumugi says. “This is… this is what I want more than anything. Give me an execution befitting—no, even better—than Enoshima Junko’s and step forward into the world filled with hope!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma turns away, pulling at his hat as he mumbles to himself, “I can’t listen to this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think,” Kaede says. “I think I can agree to that. My only regret is that we weren’t able to do this at the very beginning before Rantaro’s death, even if you would have only counted as another participant.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That would have been such a boring story, though,” Tsumugi says. “But this—this is a story that would make any Dangan Ronpa fan proud. I hope you all feel honored to be a part of this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t give a damn about Dangan Ronpa,” Kaede says. “But having any hand in your death is more than enough for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi smiles. “I’d say now we should all vote, but there isn’t even really an option for this outcome. Though that’s really not a big deal since the last vote is always just kind of a ceremony thing, to be honest.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Aw man, my career ending <i>and</i> my life ending just like that?” Monokuma says. “I’ve been working for fifty years, and I don’t even get to enjoy my retirement!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s enough,” Kaede says. “I don’t want to hear another word out of either of you ever again! You’ve killed and you’ve ruined lives, and now you’re going to get everything you deserve!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s right,” Tsumugi says. “It’s punishment time, isn’t it? This is goodbye to Dangan Ronpa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Kaede says. “Do it. Take this whole school down, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Understood,” he says. “If you believe this is the best path for ending despair, then I will begin the—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The sudden voice breaks through the angry haze that had been clouding Kaede’s mind for just a moment. “What?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“T-Tenko thinks,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks we should still vote.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at her, confused. “Why?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you’re concerned about making it official, don’t worry,” Tsumugi says. “We’ve more than gone off the rails at this point. All that matters is that the end is as big and spectacular as possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s what Tenko doesn’t want,” Tenko says. “Because—because if that does happen, then…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then what?” Kaede asks, impatience creeping into her voice.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then the killing games won’t actually end like you said,” Tenko says. “Tenko won’t be a part of that. And,” she takes a breath before straightening her back to stand taller. “And Tenko won’t be a part of killing someone either.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels her mouth fall open in shock. Ryoma is only slightly less bewildered as he says, “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma giggles. “Ooh, what’s this? A new challenger?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up!” Kaede snaps at him. “Tenko, you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “Tenko thinks that whatever way we choose to escape, it should be unanimous. Do you agree?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede calls after her again. “Tenko—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I… do see the merit in that,” Kiibo says. “If there is any hesitation, I believe it should be properly discussed before taking action.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Are you—what!?” Kaede shouts. “Tenko, what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is,” she says, “Tenko is arguing against you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As you can see the chapter count has been updated! I'm a bit unsure how long the last trial chapter will be (though I predict a bit shorter), and after that there will be the epilogue that will hopefully come out pretty soon after it. Also for those wondering, every line from an audition video is matched with a specific person, though some of them are admittedly a bit (or a lot) harder to decode than others, haha.</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Even before Shuichi died and everything changed, Tenko can’t recall a time when she hadn’t leapt to Kaede’s side. Even when standing with her had made her heart hurt, Tenko had tried to be a shoulder to lean on in the worst of times. Now she says to her, “Kaede, please, think about what you’re saying.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I—what? Of course I am,” Kaede says. “I’ve been thinking about this since the moment I discovered there was a mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko looks crestfallen at her answer. “Tenko is sorry to hear that, but,” she shakes her head. “That just means that she apologizes for not talking to you earlier! Tenko is sorry that she has failed you as a friend!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s eyes widen. “What? What are you talking about? You haven’t done anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, Tenko didn’t do anything up until now,” she says. “And Tenko is very sorry for that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is still staring at her in shock. Tenko closes her eyes for a brief moment to find and center her energy like her master had taught her so long ago.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Rebuttal Showdown)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After everything that’s happened, killing Tsumugi is the only way we can walk away from this.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When Rantaro died, I promised him I would kill the mastermind.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And it’s not just for him either. Shuichi, Gonta, <i>Himiko</i>—we’re doing this for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s justice.”</span></p>
<p class="p11"><span class="s1"><i>(Advance)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“You don’t really think that.”</span></p>
<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“Kaede, you know nothing about these trials is just.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know what you’re going to say.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If we kill Tsumugi, then we’re just like her, but that’s not true.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Killing the person who is completely unrepentant about torturing us isn’t a slippery slope to hosting killing games.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re so close to ending not just this game, but every killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And this is the way to do it. After this, the killings will stop forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko shakes her head. “Kaede, you know that’s not true. Don’t you remember what Maki said in her message?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede frowns at her. “She said that Monokuma couldn’t enforce his own rules and the killing game was a sham.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hey now!” Monokuma says. “I’ll have you know—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Quiet,” Ryoma snaps at him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “Maki said that it’s impossible to end a killing game with more killing. Tsumugi said it, too; we don’t beat anything by following the rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re not following the rules,” Kaede says. “Obviously none of this would have happened if we were working within Monokuma’s rules.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede, please think. Monokuma isn’t in control anymore but you are, and you’re doing exactly what would have happened even if—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No!” Kaede shouts back. “I’m protecting us! I’m not forcing some weird ‘sacrifice’ thing onto us or—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re making us kill each other!” Tenko shouts. “And Tenko was absolutely horrified and disgusted with herself every time Monokuma would make her kill her friends so she could live, and she refuses to do it anymore!” Tenko takes a deep breath and says softer, “Kaede, don’t you remember? Even when the culprits hurt our friends, you wanted so badly not to vote for them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede clenches her jaw. “This is different. Tsumugi isn’t our friend. She’s the person who forced us into this situation in the first place.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I never forced anything,” Tsumugi says. “You signed yourselves up remember?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede throws a hand in Tsumugi’s direction. “See? Even now she’s mocking us.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not making fun of you,” Tsumugi says. “I’m just telling the truth.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi isn’t the only person behind this,” Tenko says. “She has an entire team—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t make her less guilty for what she’s done,” Kaede says. “And if we let her live, she’s just going to keep going and make more games and hurt more people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko… Tenko doesn’t know if that’s true. Tsumugi isn’t the person behind all the killing games.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede crosses her arms. “Well, no, I know that. It’s her audience, and as much as I would like to punish them, too, that’s impossible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s supply and demand, really,” Tsumugi says nonchalantly. “The world wants killing games, and Team Dangan Ronpa provides them.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You said each ending gives them hope that fuels another season or something,” Ryoma says. “Is that it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And, Kaede,” Tenko says. “An ending where we execute the mastermind and walk away like in all the other games… that won’t do anything but give Tsumugi’s audience hope for the next killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It won’t break the cycle…” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Uncertainty flickers across Kaede’s face for a moment before Tsumugi says, “But who cares about that? The next killing game will be made using fans volunteering—the very same people who cheered you on throughout your game. Don’t you think it’s justice to make them go through what you went through?” She laughs. “Actually, from that perspective, it’s in your best interest to continue the games, don’t you think? You said it yourself, Kaede. You want to punish the world that put you here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not…” Kaede starts to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Stop twisting Kaede’s words!” Tenko shouts. “Tenko knows that Kaede makes mistakes—that she can be vengeful or push too hard—but she’s a good person, and she feels empathy and regret towards everyone she hurts. And… And Tenko knows that if she lets Kaede do this, it will haunt her forever.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip. “I… don’t know about—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Tenko says. “Please. You know yourself, and you know your real feelings.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I do,” Kaede says slowly, taking a moment to choose her words. “And… and I can handle it. It’s fine. I promise.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fine for who?” Tenko asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede shakes her head. “For everyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“When we were both holed up in Tenko’s room,” Ryoma says. “Kaede, you said that you missed everyone who had died, even the people who had betrayed us. And out of everyone, I…” he takes in a deep breath, “maybe it was all made up, but I know what it’s like to have death haunt you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede bites her lip, and says under her breath to herself, “that was different…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi scoffs. “Ryoma, you’re really turning around and being all open and forgiving now? Don’t you remember how miserable you were? Your entire life before and during the game has been nothing but pain, and I’m the one who gave you that life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma eyes her wearily. “You want to die… really, really badly, huh?” He shakes his head. “Not sure what to think about that, but I’ve said it a thousand times already, I’ve more than learned my lesson. It’s not my place to decide if someone lives or dies.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Well in the trials it is,” Tsumugi says. “It’s everyone’s place—this is everyone’s decision. You made Kiibo agree that you all have to be unanimous in your decision, so abstaining isn’t an option. If you don’t vote to kill me, then that means you think I deserve to live where everyone else has died.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, that’s wrong,” Tenko says. “Everyone deserves to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I already told you,” Tsumugi says. “I’m not part of ‘everyone.’ My life begins and ends with Dangan Ronpa. And besides, there’s really no need to feel guilty for killing off a fictional character, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko fidgets, slightly unnerved by her dismissal. “Tsumugi… deserves to live.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You really don’t want justice for Himiko, then?” Tsumugi says. “You know I didn’t think twice about strangling her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko knows that,” she says. “And that you lied to Tenko’s face when you pretended to comfort her or act like you were her friend. But Tenko also knew she would be betrayed by someone, and she promised herself that she wouldn’t hurt them the same way they hurt her. That just leads to more anger and pain, and,” she looks to Kaede, “and Tenko is sorry she didn’t help Kaede enough when she saw her going through that, and Ryoma, too, when he was hurt.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs softly. “Honestly, at this point I don’t know if you’re a saint or just hopelessly naïve. Of course the funny thing is that after that wonderful little speech, Kaede still wants my head on a spike. It’s actually kind of pathetic how all of your platitudes have really got you nothing but a pile of corpses for the entire—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“How dare you!” Kaede shouts at her. “Tenko is the one person here who actually gives a damn about you. Are you really such a disgusting, miserable person that you’d—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ha!” Tsumugi laughs. “Looks like I was right. I think I know Kaede a bit too well. We really are quite alike.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede is on the verge of yelling at her again, when Tenko says, “Kaede, it’s okay. Please try not to get too angry at Tsumugi.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede gapes at her. “How can you say that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko is angry, too, and she has always believed in proudly living with your emotions,” she says. “But she doesn’t want Kaede’s anger to consume her anymore. Tenko admires how much you care—it’s one of her favorite things about you—but you care too much and feel too responsible that… you do things. You hurt people. And Tenko promised she would help you, but she hasn’t and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko, no, that’s not…” Kaede shakes her head. “You’re not responsible for me like that.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “Tenko knew what you were feeling, and she never—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” Ryoma says. “Out of all of us, you’re the last person who should be apologizing. Think I understand what you’re trying to say, too, so just… let me say something. It might clear things up, especially if Kaede’s still on the fence. ”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko gives him a measuring looked but nods her head. “Go ahead, Ryoma. Also,” she smiles softly. “Don’t interrupt Tenko like a rude boy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He smiles back. “I’ll remember for next time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi, by contrast, is unmoved. “You know, the group hugs usually come after the trial is ov—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Shut up, Tsumugi,” Ryoma says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Present your Argument)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Does it really matter if the killing games continue?” Tsumugi asks. “After all, it’s really not your problem, you know? You don’t actually care if a few more freaky Dangan Ronpa fans get what they deserve. It’s karma, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t…” Kaede starts to say.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You have a strong sense of justice,” Tsumugi continues. “And punishing the people who made you suffer—isn’t that justice? You even pointed out the game wasn’t fair because it was punishing the wrong people. But you can set it all right and punish the right people.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“…” Kaede bites her lip.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You made a promise to everyone, too. The entire time you’ve been here has been leading up to this moment. And there are really no downsides. You get to leave the game and get a little revenge, too.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So just think about it. Isn’t in your best interest to let the killing games continue?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(BREAK)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Ryoma says. “I thought I told you to shut up.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I was just saying—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” he says. “You told me a while ago that the reason you’ve been going for this long is just out of sheer stubbornness, yeah?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede’s voice is quiet. “I remember.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“At the time, have to admit, I thought you were pretty cool when you said that. Realize now that you didn’t think there was anything else good about yourself,” Ryoma says. “I understand what it’s like to hate yourself and think it’s too late for you to stop doing bad things. Or when all you want to do is lash out at the things that made you that way.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath and rubs at her eyes. “Yeah…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Remember you also told me that at the trials, whenever you’d find the culprit, there was never any satisfaction. All you were left with was the anguish on their face,” Ryoma shakes his head. “Tenko was right, and you already know it. Forget Tsumugi. If you do something like this, it’ll hang over your head forever, right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He nods to Shuichi’s hat, discarded on the floor, and Kaede follows his gaze. “And you already said you were done punishing yourself.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede stares at the hat for a long moment before the tears starting to burn behind her eyes become too great to ignore. The second she starts to wipe at her eyes with her sleeves, a dam seems to break, and she struggles to keep her shuddering breaths quiet.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma lets out a squawk in protest as Tenko steps off of her podium, but she pays him little mind as she hurries to Kaede’s side. Tenko wastes no time wrapping her arms around Kaede’s shoulders to pull her into a comforting hug, even as she protests, muttering, “I’m okay, I’m okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma sighs as he, too, walks away from his trial stand and over to Kaede. “Sorry, Kaede. I didn’t mean to make you cry. I shouldn’t have said—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says, her words slightly muffled into Tenko’s shoulder. “No, it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi says, “The trial isn’t over yet, and you’re not allowed to leave your stands until we’re finished.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Ryoma says. “We are done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” she says. “The trial ends when we come to a consensus and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We know,” Tenko says. “And Tenko thinks we are all agreed.” She pulls away from Kaede just enough to look into her eyes. “Is… Kaede okay with that?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede nods, and wipes her tears on the back of her hand one last time. “I—I am.” She pauses, taking a deep breath, before looking to both Ryoma and Tenko. “And… thank you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t mention it,” Ryoma says with a gentle smile.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede can’t help but let out a choked laugh. “Sorry. I don’t think that’s possible for me. Seriously, thank you. I think I’m okay now. Or, at least I know I can get through this now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles, too, as she finally releases Kaede, though their hands remain intertwined. “Tenko is glad to hear that, but,” she squeezes Kaede’s hand. “She thinks she’ll stay by Kaede’s side if that’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course it is,” Kaede says, squeezing back. “I want you both by my side.” She looks down to Ryoma. “Just in case if I’m about to go off the deep end again.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t think that will happen now, Kaede,” Ryoma says. “But… think I’ll stick around, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“So,” Tsumugi says. “Instead of the protagonist bringing hope, everyone else brings hope to her. Hmm, well, it’s a bit different from tradition, but I guess it could work.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede glances across the way to Tsumugi standing alone. “I don’t know what you think ‘hope’ is. I’m not holding out for something better, or thinking that things will just work out. Because you were right.” Kaede glances briefly to Tenko for support and then down to Ryoma. “I hate you. I hate you more than I even thought was possible.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Glad to hear it,” Tsumugi says. “But you can’t bring yourself to kill me now or something?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, I know I could, and I know that I hate myself enough to do it, too,” Kaede says. “But if I want to change that—if I want to finally stop punishing myself—then I can’t get stuck on hating you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s—oh, that’s just plain nonsense, and you know it,” Tsumugi says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You don’t get it,” Ryoma says. “You already explained how you see things. We’re all static to you, but that’s not how real people are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi shakes her head. “No, that’s exactly how people are. People want the same things over and over again, and they get mad about the same things and make the same mistakes. History repeats itself, and the killing game has repeated itself for this long because that’s just the way things are. You can’t possibly think your little stand now about ‘forgiveness’ or any of that crap actually matters to a world that’s happily watched over fifty seasons of killing games and is dying to watch fifty more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Monokuma throws one of his paws in the air. “That’s right! Dangan Ronpa exists because of fans like you and your support! And if you’d like to support your adorable mascot and his plans to get a speedboat even more, then sign up for a premium account at—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can plug the merch later,” Tsumugi snaps. “This is important.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ooh, someone’s getting testy,” Monokuma says. “There’s really no need to get so upset, though. Like you said, even after the show’s over, the audience always comes back for more.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I know,” Kaede says. “You’ve made it very clear what your audience is like, and I know that the world out there is probably full of people who are yelling at me to stop talking and kill you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi laughs. “Oh, you have no idea how right you are. If only you could see what the audience has been saying about you. They’ve been calling for my head for ages now. So many descriptions about just how satisfying it would be for Tenko to bash my head in.” She smiles brightly at Tenko. “You’re really letting them down, you know.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you think Tenko will resort to killing—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, no, don’t get upset now,” Tsumugi dismisses with a wave of her hand. “It’s not what I think; I’m just saying what the audience wants. Actually, would you believe how many people were disappointed you weren’t the mastermind? It’s funny, but I guess they just couldn’t resist the potential despair.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I get it. The world doesn’t care about us or recognize us as people,” Kaede says. “And I also know that fighting a world like that—trying to tell the very people who would throw their lives away in a second for a chance to participate in a killing game… that’s just impossible isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi blinks at her. “Huh? That’s not what you’re—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The cycle you were talking about doesn’t just end, does it? Maybe Dangan Ronpa will end after this, but that doesn’t really fix the problem,” Kaede says. “The world that allowed the killing game to happen in the first place still exists. Killing you, yelling at your audience how much I hate them—none of that does anything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pauses. “So… what are you going to do then? Are you actually falling into despair over ever changing anything?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I’m breaking the cycle for myself, and maybe…” she sighs, squeezing her eyes shut for a moment. “Maybe if someone like me can let go of their hate and want to change, other people will, too. I’ll just… have to find them when I get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Our lives don’t stop with the killing game,” Ryoma says. “We’re all going to keep living. There isn’t an end of ‘hope’ or ‘despair.’ There’s just life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And Tenko agrees with Kaede,” Tenko says. “There have to be people, other survivors, who know that this is wrong—that there are no people who ‘deserve’ to be put through the killing game and hurt the same way. Tenko is going to keep fighting, Tsumugi, but fighting within your rules does nothing to stop you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And letting me get away scot-free does?” Tsumugi says. “Just listen to yourselves—you’re not making any sense.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede steps forward. “Tsumugi, you know this isn’t your story anymore. We’re not your characters, and you’re not some final boss we need to defeat.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I-I told you that’s nonsense!” Tsumugi snaps. “No matter what you say, you’re fiction, and I’m fiction, and all of this is—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s why you want to die so badly, isn’t it?” Kaede asks. “You’ve convinced yourself that you can’t live outside of the game. You can’t face going back to the real world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She scoffs. “You have no idea what the world outside is like, and you know even less about me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe not the specifics,” Kaede concedes. “But you said we were similar. If you know what I’m thinking, then I can make some guesses about what you’re—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, you idiot!” Tsumugi says. “I know you because I wrote you! An author knows their characters—and, yes, sometimes they project themselves onto their creations—but the characters can never know their creator!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re contradicting yourself again,” Ryoma says. “You want to be fiction and stand outside of it at the same time. And you still refuse to be honest with yourself, too, it seems.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s rebuilt composure fades fast. “I am fiction! All of this is fiction! We were created when the story began, and our lives end when the story finishes! Whatever is on the outside world has nothing to do with us! There is no ‘breaking the cycle’ because the cycle is all of our lives!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Tenko says. “You knew you were going to die at the end of the killing game from the very beginning, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Of course I did,” Tsumugi huffs.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“What were you before the game, then?” Tenko asks. “You had a life before you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That doesn’t matter,” she says. “Dangan Ronpa <i>is</i> my life, and I’ll say it as many times as I need to until you understand!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1"><i>(Rebuttal Showdown)</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You can make up whatever you want to about me, but the truth is I have no existence outside of Dangan Ronpa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Even if you insist that I’m real, my purpose was always to join Dangan Ronpa and become real fiction.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re all stuck on making up new lies about yourselves, so you have no idea what I’m actually like.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“If you had half the knowledge I do about our lives, then you’d know that all of us have no future and no past.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Whether you live or die at the game’s end—I don’t give a damn because as far as me and everyone at home is concerned, you’re finished as soon as they click off their TVs.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fiction is defined by the outside world.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only reason Dangan Ronpa exists is because the outside world wants it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“The only reason <i>we</i> exist is because the outside world wants us to.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“As soon as we fade from memory, we might as well all be dead for all that we’re worth.”</span></p>

<p class="p13"><span class="s1">“You’ve built up Dangan Ronpa so much that you’d rather die than try to move on from it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Why would I want to ‘move on?’ It’s who I am.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“There is nothing for me in the world besides Dangan Ronpa.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You might lie to yourselves and pretend the outside world will accept you after this, but there is no chance that will happen, especially for me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m not your friend, I’m not a person. I exist only for Dangan Ronpa, and in Dangan Ronpa, the mastermind dies at the end.”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, it is far too late to be wishy-washy like that, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It’s pointless to try to find the middle ground between hope and despair or lies and the truth, or anything else you can think of.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And you want to know why? Because no one wants a story like that!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And in this story, you kill the mastermind! You defeat despair and everyone is happy!”</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s hands gripping her podium are white knuckled, and she looks half deranged after her one-sided shouting match. “There! That’s everything! That’s—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You refuse to move on,” Kaede says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not ‘refuse,’” Tsumugi says. “It’s impossible to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“We’re all going to carry what happened here with us forever,” Kaede says. “Even if I tried my hardest for the rest of my life, I don’t think I could ever forget the things I went through or the people I met.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi lets out a clipped laugh. “So you’re traumatized forever—good to know. Seems you finally understand what I’m—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That’s not it,” Kaede says. “Everyone who died—Kaito, Miu, Himiko, Gonta, and Rantaro and Shuichi, too—I know I’ll remember them, but I’m not going to torture myself over it anymore.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“And what does that have to do with—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“My life is worth more than what you put me through,” Kaede says. “Everyone’s lives are worth so much more than this game, including yours.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi is furious as she shakes her head back and forth, her previous plain hair flurrying around her in a hurricane. “No, no, no! My life is Dangan—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t forgive you, but she does feel sorry for you, Tsumugi,” Tenko says. “She can’t imagine what it’s like to convince yourself your own life isn’t worth more than a story.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Not quite sure I’m as sympathetic,” Ryoma says. “But it’s not our place to decide whether you live or die.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then let me die!” Tsumugi screams. “I choose to die!” Though it has no effect, Tsumugi slams her hand on the voting buttons on her podium. “Kill me! <i>Just kill me already!</i>”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">There’s little for the survivors to do than exchange looks with each other as Tsumugi keeps shouting at nothing. “Hard to believe it ends like this,” Ryoma says after a moment. “But the game is finally over, isn’t it?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think so,” Kaede says. She looks up to an overhead monitor. “Kiibo? Are you still there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His voice is much weaker than before as he responds, “I am…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I want to ask one last time, is there really no way to save you?” Kaede asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kiibo says. “I have already begun diverting power to my plan to assist in your escape, and… like I predicted, I do not have the ability to escape the school. Unlike all of you, it is impossible for me to exist outside of the killing game.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kiibo,” Tenko says. “Is there really no way to take you with—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” he says again. “But that is okay. Once my body was destroyed, I got the chance to act for myself, which is more than I believe I was ever meant for. I suppose,” the project of his face smiles sadly, “I should thank Miu for that as well. I just hope helping her friends escape is enough to show my gratitude for everything she did.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You’re our friend, too,” Ryoma says, returning his smile. “Even if you are a robot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is robophobic, even if I do appreciate your lighthearted, friendly ribbing,” Kiibo says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No problem,” Ryoma says. “And if it matters, think you were getting more human every second, even now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kiibo goes quiet for a moment. Then, “thank you. I believe the same is true for you. Now is everyone ready?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede sends a quick look to both Ryoma and Tenko for confirmation before nodding. “I think we’ve been ready since the day we got here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Fair enough,” Kiibo says. “Also, I advise caution. This process is going to be… destructive.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That is fine,” Tenko says. “Tenko will protect Kaede and Ryoma from any danger.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Make sure you take care of yourself, too,” Ryoma advises. “We didn’t come this far to have anyone get crushed by rubble or something at the last second.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Exactly,” Kiibo says. “Please be ready. And goodbye.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He doesn’t give them the chance to respond, his screen flickering off as Kaede says, “Kiibo—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The rest of her words die as the floor begins to shake. Monokuma screeches, ducking behind his podium. Tenko says, “We need to get out of here. There is a chance the elevator might collapse if we do not move fast enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Kaede says. She starts to head towards the elevator, but notices a tug on her hand as Tenko stays in place. “Tenko?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You and Ryoma hurry,” she says. “Tenko will be right there.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede exchanges a nervous glance with Ryoma as she lets go of Tenko’s hand. “Okay. Just hurry.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko will,” she says before darting across the room. Kaede watches her just long enough to realize she’s heading for Tsumugi, hunched over her podium.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede,” Ryoma says to prompt her. Kaede nods distractedly and follows him to the elevator even as she keeps one eye on Tenko.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s difficult to hear the specifics of their conversation over the increasingly loud rumbling, and Kaede has to keep her focus on her steps as the group shudders more with every second. From what she can tell, Tsumugi appears to be dead to the world, shutting out Tenko shaking her shoulders and whispering to her that they need to escape. Kaede has to catch Ryoma once when his bad leg slips out from under him on a particularly strong quake, but they otherwise make it to the elevator unimpeded. He shuffles in behind her, and Kaede holds her hand on the elevator door, biting her lip as Tenko keeps trying and Tsumugi continues to remain unresponsive.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s only when the lights of the room begin to flicker and strange things—ropes, nooses, vines, and other things bouncing too wildly for Kaede to properly make out—fall from unseen trapdoors in the ceiling that Tenko wraps her arms around Tsumugi’s waist, physically dragging her out of the collapsing room. The actions causes Tsumugi to spring to life, and she flails wildly in Tenko’s grip, wordlessly screaming at her as she kicks her legs and throws her elbows back against Tenko’s torso.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels a lump of anxiety well up in her throat and is half tempted to tell Tenko to leave her behind when Tenko finally pulls the two of them over the elevator’s threshold. “Press the button!” Tenko shouts as soon as they’re through, and Ryoma wastes no time slamming his fist against the elevator’s control panel. Everyone stumbles in their efforts to stay standing as it jolts to life.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As much as Kaede feared for her life at different points in the game, she thinks little compares to the loud groaning of the elevator as it jerks up at alternating speeds. The worry that they all stepped into a death trap only takes a backseat to Tsumugi using the opportunity to wrench herself free from Tenko’s hold. She spins on her heel, one hand clinging to the grate on the door behind her for support, the other trembling as she points it at the others. Before she can get a word out, Tenko stands in front of her, putting her hands up in surrender. Her voice barely rises above the worryingly loud grinding and whirring sounds around them as she says, “Tsumugi, please listen. It’s going to be very dangerous, so we all have to—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No! This is all your fault!” she shouts. “I have nothing to do with any of this—just leave me alone, and—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi is cut off as the elevator rocks underneath them, before coming to a stop that almost knocks Kaede off her feet. Ryoma does fall, letting out a hiss as he lands on his bad knee. Tenko abandons confronting Tsumugi to hurry to his side as the door opens with a screech of uneven metal grinding together.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The image before them cracking into view through the elevator doors is somehow even more chaotic than the one they had left behind. There are armies of Monokumas that remind Kaede of the ones at Kokichi’s execution, though they are dressed in a bizarre variety of costumes from tuxedos to witches to ninjas. Giant mechanic bug creatures and fireballs launch into the wall, while steel tennis balls fly a little two low and far too close to them for comfort. The four of them are barely out of the elevator before the building makes a sickening cracking noise, and Kaede doesn’t have to hear Tenko shout in warning for her to start running.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Out in the open, things only grow more surreal. A giant piano rises out of the ground and crashes into the wall of the cage when a rocket ship slams into the side of it, while a series of mobile compactor machines go haywire, running into any and everything. There’s relative safety from being crushed in the open area outside of the shrine of judgment, giving Kaede a moment to catch her breath and witness the sheer mayhem surrounding her. She barely notices a rush of movement in the corner of her eye, until Tsumugi is front and center of her, darting towards the heart of Kiibo’s storm.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Behind her, Tenko is a few paces back, busy supporting Ryoma. She still manages to shout, “Tsumugi! Stop!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede hesitates for a moment, looking back between Tenko helping Ryoma to safety against a rather sturdy looking collapsed wall. Her leg aches under her, and Tenko screams out her name as she darts after Tsumugi.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The ceiling begins to crack against the assault, and the threat of raining debris looms over every part of the school. From her path, Kaede guesses that Tsumugi is still set on heading for the epicenter where the biggest risk of the school building itself is. The strange Monokumas seem to be on autopilot and ignore her, though they’re still difficult to wade through. None of the variety of other hazards—now saw blades, crossbows, and handguns among them—are particularly set on hurting her, either, but Kaede finds it necessary to weave and dodge the occasional stray bullet and stay vigilant of shrapnel.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi is in her sight, and it’s only when they near the central courtyard in front of the school that Kaede sees her target. Monokuma somehow escaped from the trial room, and is standing nonchalantly in front of the school, happily waving goodbye to whatever cameras somehow remain. It takes only a second of thought for Kaede to realize that Tsumugi must intend to die along with him.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The ceiling is coming down not just in fragments, but in great, heavy chunks. They crash to the right and left of Monokuma, but he pays them little mind. Kaede keeps an eye on the remaining pieces barely hanging on, each making echoing cracking noises as they break off. She accordingly swerves out of her path following Tsumugi when one piece looks to be crashing down between them. It lands with a smashing sound, and Kaede has to throw her arms up in front of her face to protect from the dust and dirt that rise up from the ground at its impact.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">She coughs and strains her eyes to see through the small cloud forming between her and where Tsumugi had run to. Blurred by the dust, Tsumugi stands proudly at Monokuma’s side. Another loud crack splits the sky above them. Kaede snaps her head up to see a piece that looks less like the clouds she had known and more like just a giant rock spilling down in its long descent.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi spies it, too. She doesn’t move, but she doesn’t seem happy with her fate either. Even though her hair is frazzled and her shoulders are heaving from her run, Tsumugi remains blank faced. The closest emotion flickering over her features is one of vague disappointment.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede doesn’t even think. She kicks off the ground, her lungs on fire as she forces her legs to move even faster and reaches out with both hands. Tsumugi finally looks back at her, her mouth moving to say Kaede’s name even as the words are drowned out into nothing.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede leaps forward, colliding with Tsumugi’s body. They hit the ground. Kaede’s world stops.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though I'm aware it's for the purposes of visually streamlining the game and doesn't really effect anything, it always bothered me in canon that Kiibo started blowing up the cage while they were as far away from the school building as possible and underground but then were suddenly teleported to right in front of the school, haha. But in less pedantic thoughts, it was nice to finally write out a few scenes I had been visualizing for so long.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Also a shorter chapter than usual (6k rather than the usual 9k) and I think the epilogue the next chapter will be even shorter, though I predict it may have a lengthy author's note, haha. I also hope to get the epilogue out by the end of the year!</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The world had shuddered for an uncomfortably long amount of time. A few sturdy walls among the dozens crumbling had fallen in such a way as to offer shelter on the far side of the school. Ryoma had recovered relatively quickly from his fall onto his bad leg—or at least had put on a brave face—but the brief window of possible safety to run through the school had long passed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The only thing keeping Tenko from running after Kaede into certain death was the fact that she had no idea where in the school to go. She had watched her for as long as she could, but when Kaede disappeared up the stairs to the main courtyard, Tenko knew there was nothing more she could do other than have faith in her. She still kept her eyes trained on the path up towards where Kaede had gone, just on the off chance that she would manage to return unscathed through the blizzard of mechanic bugs, knives, and heavy duty machinery. Tenko tried to keep the thought of how the chaos that Kaede was lost somewhere in was composed of props for Monakuma’s unused executions at bay.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It was too loud to talk, and there was nothing for either Tenko or Ryoma to do than sit sequestered in their hiding spot, hands over their ears to keep out some of the din. The sounds of the dome crashing down peaked and deescalated with due time, the sounds of the world splintering in two slowly fading into a few scattered cracks as the last few stubborn pieces tries to hold on.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">After the barrage that had just assaulted her ears, Ryoma’s voice sounds almost foreign. “Looks like… we’re all clear.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With a cautious glance, Tenko pulls herself to her feet and takes a hesitant step out of their shelter. Her sandal crunches the broken glass strewn over the ground, but other than that, the world remains silent. She pauses, half looking at the aftermath of Kiibo’s assault and half taking in the sky—the real sky. Tenko hears Ryoma attempting to stand with some effort behind her, but any thoughts of helping him are cut off when she hears something she hadn’t known she had missed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma comes to stand beside her opening his mouth to offer further comment when Tenko very softly says, “There are birds calling.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">He pauses. The quiet sounds of life that had been exiled by the killing game seem to meet him all at once. Ryoma had never had a particular affinity for nature, but he can’t help but say, “Wow…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Tenko says back.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s almost memorizing enough to get lost in. Tenko says, “We need to find Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko takes a few impatient steps, Ryoma trailing behind. Navigating the debris coating the school grounds brings his progress to a crawl. The task takes most of his focus, but Ryoma spares a glance up to see Tenko waiting for him a few feet ahead, standing stiffly and biting her lip. “You can go on ahead.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Tenko says. “It’s fine. We’ll go together.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko,” he says. “You don’t have to worry about me. The killing game is over—we’re free.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">His comment makes Tenko deflate and relax her posture. “Yeah… we are.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Nothing is going to happen to me,” Ryoma says. “So go. You always talk about being honest with your emotions, and, well,” he shrugs. “Don’t have your talent, but even I can tell what your heart wants.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Ah…” Tenko flushes faintly. She barely resists stammering, instead bowing her head to Ryoma. “Thank you, Ryoma. Tenko promises she will be right back, and she will bring Kaede with her.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Counting on you,” he says as parting words. Tenko turns her back to him and weaves her way through the rubble at a pace Ryoma could not hope to match.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Though alone, Ryoma finds it impossible to feel as isolated as he did at the game’s beginning. He pauses for a moment, standing in the ruins of his former prison, and plucks a cigarette from his pocket. Ryoma thinks he feels slightly hotter than he had during the game’s run, absently noting he’s not entirely sure what season it is outside. Without Tenko to talk to, the sounds of nature rush back in. A different bird twitters, and insects chirp their own songs.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma bites down on his candy cigarette as he picks his own way through the maze after Tenko. Her calls for Kaede echo distantly, and Ryoma takes a moment to tap the severed head of a Monokuma half buried in dirt with his crutch.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">-</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Everything is dark—everything except for a slight crack up and to her right. Kaede lies flat on her back in the door, and she squints her eyes against the invading light, half confused about what it actually is. She reaches up towards it with both hands, making contact with something solid and metal that refuses to budge at her exploratory touch. Kaede takes a deep breath, gathers whatever energy she can and shoves. It shifts with great resistance, and the light above her head grows.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">It’s not enough to free her, but Kaede takes a break, breathing heavily from the exertion. There’s a whining sound next to her, but her companion is too busy lying on her stomach, crying into the dirt to assist in their escape. As Kaede readies herself for another push, she registers that it’s not a rock over them, but a thin, sturdy metal plate. She’s confused for only a moment before she remembers the machines meant for a construction site that had been running wild and just who was controlling them. Kaede lets out a soft laugh. No one’s listening to her as she says, “Kiibo, I’ll thank you for saving me if I can get out of here.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Another push frees her enough to sit up on her elbows, providing a slightly better vantage point. “Tsumugi,” Kaede says. “I get you’re having a crisis right now, but it’d be really great if you could help just a litt—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Kaede! Kaede!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede perks up, whipping her head towards the source of the noise. She struggles to sit up further to make herself more visible as she calls back, “I’m here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t call her name again, and instead Kaede listens to the sounds of her footsteps pounding closer and closer across the charred ground. It’s only a few moments before Tenko is in full view, surveying the various piles of debris for signs of life. With a bit more shifting Kaede manages to raise one of her arms above her head, and she waves it as she calls, “Here!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko spins towards her and is at her side in seconds, helping to shove the metal plate the rest of the way off of her. Tsumugi doesn’t seem to react to her presence or the light slowly pouring over her. Tenko’s eyes widen at the sight of her. “Kaede, you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I did.” Tenko only nods in response, still speechless. Kaede clears her throat, “I can tell you the details once I get a little more breathing room.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Right,” Tenko says, snapping her attention back to freeing Kaede. “This wasn’t,” she says between her grunts of exertion, “a very safe hiding spot.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “I wasn’t really thinking about that. My guess is Kiibo came through one last time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stops pushing for a second to glance somewhere behind Kaede. “He…” she sighs. “Tenko wishes we could thank him.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede follows her gaze and spies a broken monitor in a pile with a few rocks and other destroyed furniture from the school building. “Me, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">With Tenko’s help, it doesn’t take long to move the plate far enough off of Kaede to provide her room to pull herself out with little trouble. Kaede raises a hand to Tenko for support, which she bypasses, instead helping by lifting her by the waist. Kaede wobbles a bit as she attempts to stand, though Tenko supports her without needing to be asked. Once steadied, Kaede says, “Alright—I think I’m good. Maybe a bit dizzy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko scrunches her brow in concern. “You didn’t hit your head or anything, did you?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, well, maybe a little when I hit the ground, but that’s not a big deal,” Kaede says. “I think it’s just the adrenaline rush. Or maybe the opposite—that thing where your body just collapses after you ran a marathon.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“That does sound about right,” Tenko agrees. “And… we’re almost done.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede lets out a breath as she fully takes in her surroundings for the first time. “Almost done running,” she says to herself.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Making sure Kaede isn’t about to fall over one last time, Tenko releases her and moves to kneel beside Tsumugi. “Tsumugi, please take Tenko’s hand.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi pays her about as much attention as she had to Kaede previously. At the very least, Kaede muses, she’s sitting up now, though her face is buried in her hands, and she appears to have no intention of moving. “I don’t think you’re going to have much luck, Tenko,” she says. “She can get out on her own when she wants to, so I think we can just leave her for now.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko doesn’t respond to Kaede, instead shifting the plate back even further off of Tsumugi. “Was it hard saving her?” she asks after a moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Yeah,” Kaede says. “I don’t think I’ve ever tackled anyone before, though, so that was an interesting experience. But then again, I’ve also never had five near misses at getting my head caved-in in a row.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko smiles softly up at her. “That’s not quiet what Tenko meant.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede smiles back. “I know. And the answer is yes.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Then why?” Tsumugi’s voice croaks, startlingly both girls. “Why did you…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi’s hands trembling hands have fallen into her lap. Her face is red and smeared with dirt, and Kaede absently realizes she probably doesn’t look much better. “I already told you,” Kaede says, though her voice has no bite in it. “I finally have a chance to be free—I’m not going to waste it on hating you.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But you could have died,” she says softly. “You hate me and you still…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Out of everything I think I’ve learned about myself,” Kaede says. “The number one thing is that I’m willing to risk my life for things that I know are too important to live without.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I’m important?” Tsumugi asks.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No,” Kaede says. “But moving beyond this place is.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko tries offering Tsumugi her hand again. “The game is over, Tsumugi. It’s time to leave.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stares down at her hands. “The… the story’s over then. That’s it, no more… no more anything for anyone.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“But that’s a lie, isn’t it?” Kaede says. “You can stay here and keep lying to yourself, if you want, but you have to leave fiction behind at some point.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You,” Tsumugi’s hands curl and uncurl into fists as she repeats her words from the trial. “You just don’t get it. I’m not real—I’m not.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">In this state, she reminds Kaede more of a discarded doll than a person. She says, “Then I think you’re on your own.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi doesn’t say anything more, but her body seems to shudder just for a second as if she were holding back a sob.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns to Tenko. “Where’s Ryoma?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko glances over her shoulder. “He told Tenko to go on ahead, but he might have a bit of trouble getting around, given…” a cursory look around speaks volumes for her, “everything.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Let’s go meet him then,” Kaede says. “And then, let’s see what the world’s actually like.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tenko stands and reaches a hand out to Kaede to help her navigate the small pile of rubble they had been standing in. Tsumugi stares at her hands and at their backs and up into the real sun until it hurts too much.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">They find Ryoma about halfway from the spot where Tenko had left him. His eyes widen, then his face falls into a smile at seeing Kaede. “Nice to see you again, Kaede. You sure know how to stir things up, huh?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I should probably break that habit,” Kaede says. “One of the many things I’ll have to start working on.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Don’t say that,” Tenko says. “Kaede is a wonderful person. But… it would be nice if she was a little less reckless.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think Tenko’s heart can only take so much,” Ryoma says. “By the way, Tsumugi…?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Is alive,” Kaede answers.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma glances between Tenko and Kaede, though neither seem inclined to elaborate. “Alright then.” He turns to stare back out through the collapsed walls. “What do you think is out there?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t think Tsumugi was lying from the way she was acting,” Tenko says. “Some of it was pretty hard to believe, in hindsight, though, so maybe she did lie about a few things. But also a world that can produce someone like Tsumugi must be…”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Slightly terrifying, yeah,” Ryoma says. “But then again, after the killing game, don’t think there’s much that can rattle me.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“You know, I think I thought something like that over and over again during the game,” Kaede says. “And I was wrong every time.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also true,” Ryoma concedes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks that’s okay, though,” Tenko says. “No matter what happened to us, we still felt everything just as strongly. Tenko thinks she prefers that over becoming numbed to tragedy.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes her hand again. “And that means we’re going to experience whatever comes next proudly with all of our emotions. So now, we just kind of need to think what actually is next.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Hospital should be the first stop,” Ryoma says. “Tenko, you did great, but, well, you’re no Ultimate Doctor.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko would be more offended by that if it weren’t true,” Tenko says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“After that,” Ryoma continues, “don’t know. Maybe I’ll pick up tennis for the hell of it, or see if I actually like cats and bugs and animals or something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko thinks she’d like to train or travel,” she says, “and meet as many people as possible and treat them with kindness.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma smirks at her. “By ‘people’ do you mean ‘girls?’”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“It would be preferable if they were girls, yes,” Tenko says. “But awful boys deserve kindness, too. Some awful boys.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Maybe you could teach them some manners,” he says.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko doesn’t think that’s possible,” she says, returning his teasing look. “She hasn’t met a single boy capable of learning so far.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Ryoma lets out a low pitched laugh. “Fair enough. What about you, Kaede?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I don’t know. I have no plans,” Kaede says with a laugh. “Pets and travel sounds good. Maybe I’ll play piano until my hands fall off or try to protest anything else related to killing games. I think I’m going to do whatever I need to stay on the path of becoming someone I like. And then just hope—no,” she shakes her head, “do everything I can to make sure that that’s enough.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede feels Tenko squeeze her hand. “Tenko thinks that is very admirable, Kaede.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Also sounds like the hard work’s just beginning, then,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, I know,” Kaede says. “I think I can handle it, though. I think we all can. We should make it a promise, too.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tenko agrees,” Tenko says. “Tenko doesn’t want to forget what happened here, but she also wants to move forward.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Think I can agree to that, too,” Ryoma says. “Face reality, try to change for the better… all sounds good.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede takes a deep breath. “Then we better get started.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">The easiest path out to navigate is the areas around where a giant piano had smashed straight through the outer wall. Kaede glances up at the massive instrument broken on its side. She has few doubts she came very close to seeing it up close and personal for its original purpose, but the thought doesn’t even make her shudder. Tenko says, “Kaede, watch your step here,” and Kaede turns away.</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">From the ruins of the killing game, the three survivors slowly but surely stumble out of the rubble. The first step outside where the cage had been feels both significant and somehow no different at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Then, “Wait! Wait!”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns her head. Tsumugi trips and falters in her path, but she keeps calling out to them. Tenko says, “Tsumugi? Why are you—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi comes to a stuttering stop as if she physically cannot leave the school. “You,” she says. “You can’t just leave me here. I—we—we all have no where to go. So you can’t—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Thought you wanted to stay in the school,” Ryoma says.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Her hands fist in her skirt. “I can’t. There’s nothing left, and it’s all your fault so you have to take responsibility.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede furrows her brow. “You can’t be serious.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Oh, yes, I can,” Tsumugi say. “This school was our entire world, and now it’s gone, so someone has to do something about it. And since you didn’t let me die, you have to take responsibility for your actions.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">For a moment, Kaede wants only to point out how childish her argument sounds. But Tenko whispers to Kaede first. “She still can’t accept it.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“I think you’re right,” Kaede whispers back. Then, to Tsumugi, “Now that your life isn’t someone’s ‘writing credit’ or whatever, you have no idea what to do. Is that right?”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi nods. “There’s nothing for me out there, so—so you need to do something.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“Tsumugi,” Kaede says. “I don’t like you or forgive you for what you’ve done to us. So all I can say to you is this: take responsibility for your own life.”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">“No, no,” Tsumugi shakes her head. “That’s not—”</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Kaede turns away from her. She looks at both Ryoma and Tenko for confirmation, and the three walk away from the wreckage.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Tsumugi stares wide eyed and open mouthed at their departure. She can feel her knees shaking, and she knows her legs are about to give out from under her if she stays still for another moment. Her first step is more an awkward lurch, and the uneven ground gives her trouble in her rush out of the killing game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Chapter End Notes</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">Over the course of this fic, quite a few people have commented that they thought there was some secret hidden in the summary, and, well, there kind of was, haha. I’ll admit some parts of the description are a bit of an artifact from when I first started this story and didn’t have a solid grasp on what its direction was. However, I also feel like I’ve had things like the title and summary be what they are for far too long to change them, which is probably just as well since I have no idea what I would potentially change them to. Overall, though, I am happy with what this project became.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">One of the questions I do want to answer here is why I wrote this fic. My first answer is that V3 posed an interesting question in its first chapter and gave enough of a potential path for it to come to fruition in chapter six. There was even an incredibly handy divergent point in the first chapter trial wherein Shuichi decides he can’t go through with outing Kaede, but then does a 180 in thoughts and pulls himself together because the plot kind of needs him to. The second answer is that I love V3. It’s definitely a flawed game, but it inspired me to start writing and to write a lot. I suppose some people write love letters, and I wrote a love novel, haha.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">I also learned a lot about writing while doing this to the point where I have a bit of trouble going back and reading the first few chapters. It got to the point where when a very nice person did a recording of chapter one, it took me forever to listen to because I kept getting embarrassed (the recording is posted on chapter one and chapter thirty-six I if you want to check it out!). There are certain points in the fic that I feel drag and others where I wish I had been better about planting earlier foreshadowing, and many other smaller points I know I would fix if I were to do this again (though in spite of me occasionally entertaining the idea of a talent swap au, I’d like to think I have enough self-control not to launch another project like this so soon, haha). However, as a final project, there is a lot I am very happy with, not to mention that I am just grateful for the sheer process teaching so much about writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">As for the future, I intend to post some more oneshots and maybe impromptu start another multi-chaptered fic or two, though I’m less sure if I’ll hold myself as strictly to finishing those, which I hope is reasonable given what I have finished, haha. And, of course, I also hope to continue reading and commenting on all the wonderful fics other authors in this fandom have written!</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s1">And, of course, I have to mention the amazing reception this fic has gotten. The attention I have gotten has almost been overwhelming sometimes, but it is absolutely that support that has kept me going to this point. Though I am not expecting 400 comments on this chapter (though that would be amazing, if not a bit terrifying, haha), I would love to hear from everyone who has been following along, whether on this chapter or the fic as a whole, especially since as this is the last chapter, I want to respond and interact with as many comments as I can. I also got a curiouscat thing on twitter, in case anyone happens to have shorter, more direct questions or want to ask non-fic related things. This fic might be a love letter to V3, but it only exists because of the support from the fandom. I can’t thank you all enough!</span></p>
